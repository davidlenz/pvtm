<p align="center">Paragraph Vector Topic Model</p>

**PVTM** relies upon the Paragraph Vector (also known as [Doc2Vec](https://arxiv.org/abs/1405.4053) ) to generate document 
representations which are then clustered using Gaussian Mixture Models. 
**PVTM** represents documents in a semantic space, which has been shown to capture latent variables of the underlying documents, e.g. the latent topics. 
Clusters of documents in the semantic space can then be interpreted and transformed into meaningful topics by means of Gaussian mixture modeling.
