spoilers spoilers spoilers spoilers br br there are bad movies and then there are movies which are so awful that they become affectionately comical in their ineptness such is the case with columbia pictures' 'the grudge ' this cinematic atrocity began when an otherwise well intentioned american saw a japanese made for tv film 'ju on' and was inspired to remake the movie in english this began a virtual tsunami of bad decisions which circumnavigated the globe until it washed ashore in orlando on october 21 2004 br br the premise and i use the word loosely involves a house in tokyo haunted by a skinny momma ghost who looks like a cross between margaret cho and alanis morrisette along with her ghastly sidekick a chubby rambunctious but evil second grader is there anything scarier than a creepy 8 year old japanese boy sure there is count chocula comes to mind with this whimsical bunch we must add a mysterious black cat who i have affectionately named chim chim remember speed racer as you have already guessed they were murdered in this domicile of doom and now desire to kill everyone who enters the premises you see as explained by a japanese detective when someone dies in a rage their ghost seeks revenge on everyone who steps on the property lines as defined by the county commissioner or something like that i forget br br the story begins innocently enough with acclaimed thespian bill pullman leaping to his death from a balcony my guess is bill pullman got this job because of his kids begged him for a trip to tokyo disneyland next we endure the mildly interesting saga of nurse yoko 'oh no don't go in there' screams the audience but alas she heeds not the dire warnings and is predictably snuffed out like a magic lantern about 30 minutes into the movie we finally see its american heroine sarah michelle gellar as karen sarah michelle gellar might be a competent actress but i could not help thinking of buffy the vampire slayer so much so that it was distracting it is the equivalent to having jennifer anniston star in a movie about the adventures of six friends in new york try as you may you just can't stop thinking about the other project which made her famous but i digress karen the nurse is hired as a replacement for the original care giver who disappeared at spooks r us br br she snoops around meets the ghosts coma lady dies and some other stuff happens watching the fair haired vixen searching for clues i half expected her to find the ghost and pull its mask off to reveal it was actually old man gower who owned the abandoned amusement park 'i would've gotten away with it too if it weren't for you meddling kids and that dog of yours ' br br director takashi shimizu who is vying to be the ed wood of asia made two unfortunate decisions involving sound first he choose to use a soundtrack only when someone is about to be killed this is an excellent devise for obliterating any suspense because the audience gets a two minute warning to prepare for another miserably predictable murder second he gave the ghosts a bizarre guttural noise that sounds like a gargling gopher after the movie i heard several people exiting the theatre making the sound and laughing br br sarah michelle gellar ends up being the sole survivor and of course we learn that the fire she set to burn down the house was extinguished in time for the obligatory next chapter however considering the humorous reactions of the audience they did not want a sequel but an apology 'the grudge' could be easily re edited into a comedy perhaps then it will be appreciated for its camp value baring that this will go down as the greatest cinematic thriller since 'godzilla vs megalon ' i would suggest waiting until the movie comes to your local discount theatre where it can receive the public ridicule it so richly deserves
there were a lot of 50's sci fi movies they were big draws for the drive in theaters a lot of them were crappy even back then this movie and 'the day the earth stood still' stand out and both have aged well in their own way from the very beginning with its eerie theremin musical score which still sounds weird since theremins are hardly ever used forbidden planet takes you where no man has gone before speaking of star trek there's so much material in this film that got into star trek tos its like a pilot for the series from the interactive captain first mate doctor the mad scientist alien beings babe in short skirt computer intelligence it is all de rigeur now but this was the first of its kind besides it has good acting and well done artwork which even today evokes a certain awe at the imagery consider how the huge krell machine is successfully depicted with some real depth i saw this as a kid at a drive in 0 when it was a new movie and it scared me of course every movie that was even vaguely scary did back then but i remember being real worried about the invisible monster forbidden planet is a movie a sci fi fan can watch several times and find something new with each viewing
i'm a fan of crash and blade runner and this movie explores some of those highway death and 80s film noir themes that i like to see so i enjoyed it br br in general though the essential stupidity of the film noir protagonist is not pulled off well by the female lead and her hero is nearly a neanderthal hence the kitch warning
in a little town in montana two brothers grow up one of them is norman craig sheffer the other is paul brad pitt their father is reverend maclean and they grow up with his lessons that has to do with religion and the lessons of fly fishing in this movie fly fishing represents life a little br br the story is good and keeps your attention although there are some moments you need a little action probably the movie has this moments because it is not really about the events that happen but about the message some things do happen though norman goes to dartmouth to study after six years he returns and gets involved with a nice girl named jessie emily lloyd and he is invited to teach in chicago paul has become a reporter and is known as the fishing reporter he is famous and it seems he has a nice life but he drinks a little too much and gambles too much br br the movie is very well directed it has a nice score and all of the actors are good the most beautiful thing in this movie is the cinematography the mountains the woods and the river all look very beautiful if the movie was only made for these things it was good enough to watch fortunately there is more
it's good to see that vintage film buff have correctly categorized their excellent dvd release as a musical for that's what this film is pure and simple like its unofficial remake murder at the windmill 1949 the murder plot is just an excuse for an elaborate girlie show with kitty carlisle and gertrude michael leading a cast of super decorative girls including ann sheridan lucy ball beryl wallace gwenllian gill gladys young barbara fritchie wanda perry and dorothy white carl brisson is also on hand to lend his strong voice to cocktails for two undoubtedly the movie's most popular song it is heard no less than four times however it's gertrude michael who steals the show not only with her rendition of sweet marijauna but her strong performance as the hero's rejected girlfriend as for the rest of the cast we could have done without jack oakie and victor mclaglen altogether the only good thing about oakie's role is his weak running gag with cult icon toby wing in fact to give you an idea as to how far the rest of the comedy is over indulged and over strained super dumb inspector mclaglen simply cannot put his hands on the killer even though would you believe in this instance it happens to be the person you most suspect director mitch leisen actually goes to great pains to point the killer out to even the dumbest member of the cinema audience by giving the player concerned close up after close up
first of all this is a low budget movie so my expectations were incredibly low going into it i assume most people looking at the info for this movie just wanted a bloodfest and essentially that's all it is br br plot there really is none it's basically saw but in china and a whole hell of a lot worse cast there is none period special effects absolutely awful in my opinion there were cutaways and the blood was often completely unbelievable because of amounts splatter color texture etc br br i believe the purpose of this movie was supposed to be a brutal shock film now it had some great potential on a bigger budget but poor scripting poor dialogue awful acting what seemed like camcorder video shots and just plain unbelievable gore made this movie truly awful br br there are movies worth taking a chance against some reviews even b rate movies deserve some opportunities blood trails for example was the most recent i saw against reviews that was worth it but this was simply awful i hope that people considering this movie read my comment and decide against it br br i'm all for brutality and shock but the overall unrealism and truly awful acting makes for an awful experience save your time money and chance something else you won't be disappointed
this is the absolute worst movie i have ever seen there was absolutely nothing good to say about this movie i have seen some bad movies but this one takes it there is no plot and most of the movie you are either fast forwarding the movie to get it done faster or you are wondering what the hell is going on because you can't seriously think that someone thought of this movie and you are watching it i feel sorry for anyone who has to sit through this painful hour and a half please take my advice and do not watch this movie for i know you will think it is the biggest waste of time you have ever spent in your life
this movie was my first touch with mr sica so i really didn't know what to expect but what i saw just broke all my expectations in a good way br br the storyline is not complex and shows us a life of found boy orphan and particularly his connection into the community of poor people who together built themselves a hood of simple metal plate houses this little city in another city lives own life and things are going fine but one day there is a water resource found and a rich nobles man is getting interested in the buying the place but as the title of the movie hints there is a miracle taking place our character gets a wonder dove from his dead mother what is he going to do to protect his friends and all built city as well br br it was just a masterpiece of natural comedy there is shown the behavior of poor people and how money and property can talk and play with people also many funny moments and scenes are included at the beginning with the spot where sun is shining and many more br br so according to the fact that i m not a comedy lover you should see this movie because i liked it much br br i
i actually found this movie 'interesting' finally one worth my time to watch and rent it is true some scenes were over the top on emotionalism shouting etc but what movie doesn't stress its agenda genre or 'ax to grind' almost none what surprised me is that i read a review elsewhere done by a s fran reviewer on another review site but found his negative review instead a more accurate description of his own review of the movie not of the movie at all anyone that watches this movie will realize that it is great to recommend to family and friends no car chases yea being in an italian family myself i can fully relate to the environment portrayed on the screen the movie has its tear jerking parts as well it is what real life can be in such an environment nice movie
we loved school of rock and jack black we couldn't wait to go and see this movie it was the only time in my life the movie was so bad i wanted to walk out my husband hated it too the only funny parts were in the trailers my husband and i wanted to stand outside the movie theater and tell people to save their money the writing was awful it had every terrible stereotype of hispanic people who should be utterly offended the movie wasn't that long but to us it seemed like an eternity the people in the theater were so restless and silent it was like watching paint dry i made my husband stay because i was sure there would maybe be some redeeming parts but there weren't save you money and your time
yes i am just going to tell you about this one so don't read if you want surprises i got this one with the title christmas evil there was also another christmas horror on the dvd called silent night bloody night whereas silent night bloody night not to be confused with silent night deadly night had lots of potential and was very close to being good this one wasn't quite as good it started out interesting enough watching the villain if you can call him that watching the neighborhood kids and writing in books about who is naughty and nice but after awhile you are looking for some action and this movie doesn't deliver you need character development but this goes overboard and you are still never sure why the heck the guy snaps about an hour in he kills three of four people while a whole crowd watches in terror and the guys he kills aren't even his targets they are just making fun of him this is one of many unsuccessful attempts by the killer to knock of the naughty he then proceeds to try and kill this other guy and he tries to break into his house by squeezing himself into the fireplace he promptly gets stuck and barely manages to get out he then enters through the basement and then tries to kill the guy by smothering him in his bedroom he can't seem to kill the guy this way so he grabs a star off the tree and slits the guys throat what the heck was a tree even doing in the bedroom in the first place oh yeah the killer before this kill stopped off at a party and had some fun too well that is about it except for the town people chasing him with torches and the unresolved part with his brother and that tune he wants to play what was that even about he kept talking about something that was never really explained how does it end you ask well since i have spoilers i will tell you he runs off the road in his van and proceeds to well lets just say it was lame
okay this show is nothing but awesome it has a great story line and plot and great actors and actresses jeremy sumpter is so hott and he is perfect for the role he is gunna be big in hollywood he has a bright future ahead this show better last a long time because i really love this show and i hope that it has a lot of success it is so interesting i have been waiting for it to come out for about 6 or 7 months and it's finally here and it's great i tape it too i can watch it whenever i want now too bad its only on once a week though i wish it was on at least twice a week because now i wish that it was tuesday every day hope you all like this show br br ashley
full marks for pacino's rendering of the speech over the dead kid's coffin shakespeare's mark antony would be put to shame br br was it paul schrader or was it ken lipper who should be complimented on the remarkable dialogues they are rich and intelligent and well worth your time if you like movies with good scripts i found the story narrative developing quite well right up to the voice over postscript br br there is little else to talk about in this film even john cusack has done better roles than this one interestingly the film is very male oriented the women are mere appendages
this film by oscar petersson is unique its uniqueness doesn't lie in the story since many a half brained hollywood production has served us comparably miserable plots but rather in the thorough way that complete and utter lousiness in one aspect is joined with equal lousiness in all other aspects br br the dialog is worse than embarrassing rotten acting and abysmal direction are thrown into the mix bosnians speaking english with heavy swedish accents add an unintentional element of humor uninspired lightning and camera work are icing on the turkey film cake as a sort of surprise for the audience there are a few completely unmotivated slow motion sequences where you'd least expect any to add insult to injury the whole thing is cut by someone devoid of any sense of timing br br the bad guy henchman turns good after hearing good guy's speech scene in the church is the point at which is time to dethrone ed wood from the position as the worst director of all times move over ed wood here comes oscar petersson
an excellent series masterfully acted and directed but unloved i am told by mr deighton and withdrawn by him after a single presentation it is now only viewable in private collections and via the british film institute at special request very unfortunate as ian holm's nuanced portrayal of the weary but determined bernard samson is superb one of his very best performances the supporting cast including the young amanda donohoe and hugh fraser are superb with mel martin playing the conflicted and traitorous wife and michael degen as the mercurial werner the story positively simmers with the tragic and fateful personal consequences of the great game
i cannot see why filmmakers remade this movie br br the 1972 movie with mcqueen and mcgraw is almost a classic steve mcqueen was an outstanding actor and baldwin is only an inadequate actor he has no passion in his play also the action in the original getaway was fantastic but the remake has no action it is almost boring despite the fact that the film making in 1972 was more difficult than in 1994 br br i don't understand the way that baldwin imprisoned from mexico i think this is a mistake in the story br br so i think that there was no need to remake it or if they decided to remake a classic they must choose an excellent actor for the first role like johnny depp or brad pitt
this is the finest film ever made to deal with the subject of aids it's a documentary about two men living with and dying of this illness the film is beautiful heartbreaking funny and incredibly moving above all it is an amazing true love story be sure to have a few hankies ready before you watch this movie you will need them extraordinary
seriously the only good thing about this year ceremony were the winners br br although the ceremony itself was pretty short it still was somewhat boring i think it's seriously time to look for a new director and producers for the show who can come up with something really new it's pretty obvious that they tried to make the show more 'hip' and appealing for a younger audience this year by letting beyonce perform and letting p diddy and prince present a category also letting chris rock be the presenter was an attempt to re new the ceremony and make it more appealing none of it really worked out br br sure chris rock is a funny guy but he wasn't really a good presenter i really merely saw him as a guy who just talked every now and then in between of the different categories his presence wasn't really as 'big' as for instance billy crystal's br br also the handing out of the awards was pretty dumb at times not letting everybody come to the stage but also handing out some of the awards in the middle of the theater was plain weird br br still i can't remember being any more satisfied with the award winners none of the movies really swept away the awards as the last couple of years always had been the case so does that mean it had been a good year for movies with lots of competitive contestants i don't think so i think most of the movies will be largely forgotten in 20 years from now with the exception of million dollar baby and the passion of the christ maybe sure i don't agree with every single award that was handed out this year for instance caleb deschanel should had won for best cinematography not that i don't like robert richardson's work he really did some amazing work for most of oliver stone's work but i really feel that deschanel deserved the award way more also i would had liked seeing jim miller and paul rubell win for best editing and john debney for best music but oh well there is no way the academy awards can please everybody of course i understand that there will always be people complaining about the winners br br it also was funny to see that most of the award presenters were way more nervous than the nominees and winners did prince said any of the nominees names right at once and were is sean penn's sense of humor al pacino and jeremy i hope they missed irons were the best presenters of the night br br overall a very forgettable show but with nice winners br br 4 10
cq was the worst film i saw this year nearly every film i choose to see in the theater is at least entertaining or has something to say this film looked like like it was directed by a film student for his intro to filmmaking class his father makes great films his sister made a good one but brother roman no one critic had the audacity to compare this film to godard's le mépris contempt while coppola jr did take the same idea a film about film he tried too hard to make himself seem european artsy and witty when it's all really just kitsch the lead actor carries the same expression through the whole film like he's either in awe or in shock of this film being made around him schwartzman somehow manages to pull off his role as a flamboyant director depardieu is alright the one scene that has any real film spoof humor at all is surprisingly not the b movie scenes but rather one which takes place in italy a montage of shots of several various characters inside a very small car driving around picking up and dropping off random people this was the only thing that reminded me of the cinema i am guessing he was trying to spoof or rip off or both the documentary with the lead talking into the camera and filming various objects has been played out the ending was tagged on for the sake of a twist or artistic value i suppose the funniest thing about this film was the film itself and not in the way it intended no wonder this film was sent back after a festival screening to be re edited or re shot or whatever which makes me curious as to just how bad it was before i can't believe it could have been worse than this if you want to see a good parody of film check out the austin powers films any of them the opening to the third is more entertaining and more genius than this entire film lil' romy for the sake of cinema please go back to directing your cousin's music videos leave the godfathers to daddy
jim carrey is good as usual and even though there are quite a few jim carrey moments it's definitely not a jim carrey movie br br it's targeted mostly at children and i managed to enjoy it as such movie it was promoted in israel as another jim carrey movie so those who expected a weird over the top comedy were disappointed br br the movie has nice moments and works well as a movie for kids i can't say i loved this movie but then again i'm not its target audience
this film makes a strong comment about the italian people of the time the use of the mirrors to enhance the revelations of the characters is lovely and i can't not mention the beauty and magnificence of sophia loren and mastroianni i love them both their way of interacting is so beautiful and natural that you may question whether or not the camera is actually there the husband in his brief role is also excellently portrayed as the fascist italian who commands his wife and children but in his own way a loving father the beginning scenes with hitler at piazza venezia with all the italians is incredible and really places the film historically i loved the film and i also agree that it is funny it isn't more renowned
i was lucky enough to get a dvd copy of this movie recently and have now seen it for the 2nd time the 1st time was on late night tv in australia more than 20 years ago but i could never forget this strange and bleak film br br not many people like this film at all because it is so unconventional the fact that there is hardly any spoken dialogue in this move we just hear the thoughts of characters is only one unconventional aspect of it br br searching for a copy of this film i found out that the producer was dead the main actor was dead it was not kept in any british tv or film archives that it was never released on video or dvd that television networks around the world trashed it after their copyright ran out in the 80's when it was first shown on tv in australia there were no recordable devices for consumers br br on the second viewing recently i could see why it was unforgettable at times it is very tense and unbearably claustrophobic very like a harold pinter stage play br br again if anyone wants a dvd copy of this please email me and i'm sure we can work something out regards adam whiteflokati hotmail com
ride with the devil directed by ang lee crouching tiger is another gem in this fine directors cap for those unfamiliar with the history of the kansas missouri border wars during the american civil war see this film you will visit a sad piece of americana besides some superb action scenes quite bloody at times this is a story of love devotion between men one lady in particular it stars toby maguire skeet ulrich jeffrey wright as the young lady jewel i never heard or seen her before i want to see more of her the acting is top notch superb production values very well written adapted from a novel br br this is a long film 128 minutes but well worth seeing br br my rating is br br respectively submitted br br jay harris br br
with a simplistic story and an engaging heroine this was the horror movie that started it all john carpenter brings to life a nail biting nightmare on halloween night when laurie strode jamie lee curtis in her debut career defining role and her mischievous friends plan a night of sneaky fun only to cross paths with a relentless psychopath from hell br br michael myers has escaped from a nearby insane aslyum having slaughtered his sister fifteen years earlier he is now back in haddonfield the sleepy illinois town where his murder took place once he sets his eyes on laurie after she drops off a package to the abandoned house where he lived he begins to stalk and terrorize her turning her night of fun into terror as he picks off anyone in his path to get to her br br beautiful cinematography and lighting really make this moody horror flick scary with the long gloomy shots it constantly feels as if you're being stalked by the maniacal serial killer himself myers is hidden well until fully revealed at the exciting conclusion br br although halloween is certainly outdated it is by no means less chilling the idea alone is goose bump inducing and this little shocker is one of the most famous and memorable horror movies ever made to this day it spawned seven sequels and eventually rob zombie's equally scary remake and it set a new standard for horror that still exists today
this is actually an insult to the victims and their families of the btk killer the events in this movie are not even close to the truth why they couldn't make a movie of the real events doesn't make any sense since the real events are more interesting then this made up farce don't even waste your time watching this for free low budget and a shameful depiction of the events which should not be made a joke of which is really what this movie did if they would allow me to give a 10 to this movie i would the acting sucked and it looks like it was shot on an old vhs video camera from the 80s save your time and money by not watching this movie
this film is a pia zadora special when viewing it i was reminded of the classic cartoon showing a hollywood starlet in urgent need of another role but afraid of becoming typecast for 'b' movie or soft porn roles who says at her casting session well of course i do not normally do roles requiring nudity but if it is artistically necessary for the film this recollection brought up a very naughty image of a similar cartoon showing pia at such a session saying well of course i do not normally take any roles requiring actual acting but if it will really give me sufficient exposure to enhance my status as a sex symbol this is probably grossly unfair the rather sordid tale is the fault of harold robbins book considering the nature of the story pia's exposures certainly do not receive undue attention and perhaps pia who once won an acting award in butterfly is deliberately satirising her part rather than attempting to act in an almost unplayable role critics usually point first to the actors as the problem whenever a film proves disappointing but this is grossly unfair the scriptwriters and director are far more often the guilty parties the real problem with the lonely lady is that the screenplay like the original book looks for sensation rather than substance and nothing can help with this br br the screenplay for this film is abysmal but whether the story could have been filmed more successfully with a better script tauter directing and really competent acting must remain a matter of personal judgement as it was released my viewers rating for it would depend upon whether i am assessing my personal opinion or assessing to what extent the film succeeds in providing what it aims at doing my personal rating for it would be two out of ten but to some extent this film probably provides exactly what its sponsors intended and judged on this basis a quality rating of four out of ten would be reasonable being in a charitable mood and wanting to make it clear that i am not blaming pia for my disappointment i will give an imdb rating of four
wow this is really not that good br br i would like to agree with the others in that at least the acting is good it is but it is nothing special br br the movie is so precictable and i for one am sick of receiving culture info through movies br br
i love all dogs go to heaven even though i'm a guy this and the land before time are the best animated films that don bluth has made in the movie gharlie barkin burt reynolds is helped by his friend itchy dom deluise freedom out of the pound in new orleans 1939 charlie who's in casino business wants to share equal with his partner carface vic tayback carface who is unwilling to share the equal with charlie pushes a car on a bridge onto charlie killing him charlie enters heaven and meets annabelle melba moore who shows charlie that his time is up by showing him a watch that has stopped and she explains that all dogs go to heaven because all dogs are naturally good charlie hides the stop watch behind his back and switches it back and he returns to earth alive with annabelle screaming you can never come back charlie reunites with itchy and they go and explore soon to find out that carface has not only attempted to murder charlie he has also kidnapped a little orphan girl named ann marie judith barsi when carface leaves charlie and itchy help ann marie escape the next day charlie itchy and ann marie go to look for money ann marie sees a couple who she thinks would make great parents for her while ann marie talks to the couple charlie sneaks up behind the man and steals his wallet charlie ann marie and itchy then go to a horse race where they bet the man's money that a horse will win the race the horse they said would win winds up winning and charlie itchy and ann marie are payed 1 000 for the bet charlie promises ann marie he'll use the money to give to the poor but winds up buying a new casino and gambling and buys pizza for his friend flo loni anderson and her puppies soon ann marie has found out that charlie had stolen the wallet from the man and used his money on the horse race and everything charlie sad about this has a dream about going to hell and the devil soon charlie awakens and finds out that ann marie is gone she has left to give the wallet back to the couple who forgive her about the wallet and invite her to breakfast charlie asks ann marie to leave with him and she does pretending to be sick but are captured by mice who try to feed them to king gator but they manage to escape soon carface shows up and captures ann marie he plans to drown her but charlie comes to the rescue and calls on king gator who eats carface charlie's time is up and he must die again itchy with the help of the other dogs finds the couple who took ann marie in and get them to come with them to where ann marie is they are there in time to save ann marie but are too late to save charlie who's time has ended charlie who is awarded for his heroic effort for saving ann marie is welcomed back to heaven but before he enters he says good bye to ann marie who has been adopted by the couple and asks her to take care of itchy for him she says yes and tells charlie she loves him and good bye charlie enters heaven again as it's said all dogs go to heaven filled with wonderful animation characters and story don bluth has proved to us again that he is a good animator it's too bad this movie was release the same year little mermaid which is my favorite disney movie they both came out in 1989 which was the year before i was born i guess i'll have to call them both the best animated features of 1989 10 out of 10
this movie is worth seeing for the visual beauty and moving acting alone but there also is an interesting cultural subtext of alienation women and performers both brought together in a supporting role of a transvestite opera star are both doomed to be relegated to subserviant roles in china this makes the unlikely bonding between an aged street performer and a young girl even stronger as a triumph over the native culture br br the only problem i had with this movie was the tendency of the soundtrack to swell up with emotion rendered unnecessary by the actors' performance br br a welcome alternative to unsatisfying summer action movies
just a regular jason lee movie there were some parts of the movie that were funny the undertone of the move is to live life on the edge i guess these are the types of movies that i think 14 year old girls watch at slumber parties it was an all right movie it is kind of one of those movies you have on in the back ground and look up every now and then to when something catches attention i think that julia stiles and selma blair are a good combination and would like to see them in a movie with a good story and plot its just kind of a boy meets girl movie this is that perfect movie they would show on comedy central i am glad that i didn't see this movie in the theater i would have been angry but i guess that's why i didn't see it in the theater
ghost of dragstrip hollow was one of the many '50s movies about hot rodding teens encountering the supernatural in this case the teens can't pay the rent for their hangout and get evicted with nowhere else to go they decide on an apparently haunted house as you may have guessed once they arrive some weird things start happening and there's a twist at the end br br there's nothing in this movie that you haven't seen in other movies but it's nice entertainment nonetheless my favorite character was the foul mouthed parrot well let me rephrase that he didn't talk like a character in a quentin tarantino movie but he said things that we don't expect out of a bird the movie's pure hokum but harmless
i wasn't sure whether to laugh or cry porretta was good looking but resembled like a mexican porn star not an english outlaw costumes what costumes a t shirt with strips of black leather on it it was marion's clothes or lack of them that really got me do the 'fans' of this stinker really believe women dressed like that in medieval england the mongols and vikings were inaccurate and stupid but the episode with an alien was worst of all especially as his make up mainly consisted of oatmeal on his face an old trick the hedgehog monster was pretty funny as was climbing up the side of a castle on a ladder of arrows as if the us accents grated as did the initial drawling voice over' raw bin hood and liddle john' the second robin and marion were really quite minging in looks and what was left of the show went totally down the pan
this movie was a fascinating look at creole culture and society that few african americans are aware my own two children are by products of a paternal grandmother whose father was a member of the gens de couleur libre and a black skin woman whose parents were ex slaves he married outside of and against his culture and was cut off from all of his family except for one sister who took pity on her brothers plight raising 8 children during the great depression of 1929 providing the family with food whenever she could of course she clandestinely aided this family fearing for her own ex communication my daughter was fascinated by the movie we have made it a part of our library
warning contains spoilers br br first of all i would like to say that i really liked this game i got it for christmas after two months of dropping hints to my parents i am glad that i did that br br first off i would like to say that the single player was very good the first level is probably one of the best in the game when you are at a party in london and some evil guys ruin it by kidnapping the prime minister's daughter of course you have to rescue her and it is quite a big level but should probably take you at least five minutes the best part and i think also the funniest part is when you are in the jet pack and people are rappelling down big ben just equip the jet pack's most trusty rocket launcher and blast the clock faces and the enemies down pure fun br br the rest of the levels are very good but pretty short there are four mini levels you can unlock and that is one of the let downs because only the first two of them are actually fun and the last two to unlock are just 'kill 25 enemies' objectives i mean c'mon we got loads of points to unlock these missions and the last two bonus missions are really bad br br the multi player me and some of my friends agree is very good and challenging even if there are no bots halo didn't have any bots but that is still some fine multi player games you can be a load of bad guys and you go against each other and you can also set traps which is the best way of killing people without going into view of their character br br gameplay 8 5 10 levels can be quite repetitive and bonus missions could be improved graphics 9 10 there is the odd bad graphic but that isn't extremely often multiplayer 10 10 needs no comment just great you get to drive in jet packs and vehicles sound 8 10 replay value 7 10 the only levels i go back on are the loondon level and istanbul part 1 br br i give this game 8 5 10 br br could have a bit of improvement but it's still good
i've read a number of reviews on this film and i have to say what is wrong with you people this was an excellent film i thought this film was superb from start to finish and the story was extremely well told i'm convinced that the people that didn't like this film weren't paying very good attention to the film there are a number of very important scenes that if you aren't paying attention you will be confused and the following scenes may not make sense i urge anyone who didn't like this film to watch it again and watch it alone so that you can truly pay attention the story made perfect sense to me and as i said was very well told every scene in the film has a point and everything fits together at the end of the film br br all the actors did a fantastic job sean connery was very good in his role as always laurence fishburne was superb as tanny brown playing a very interesting character kate capshaw was a nice touch as well and looks fantastic blair underwood was a pleasant surprise i didn't really expect anything great from him but he pulled off a great performance ed harris was the real gem in the film he plays a truly sick individual and really makes you see how disturbed his character is watch his eyes in his scenes just superb also there is a very young scarlett johansson as kate in one of her first roles not a bad place to start excellent cast in this film br br i would strongly recommend this film to anyone that likes any of the cast members or just likes thrillers this is a great film and should be seen don't listen all these other people's opinions go see the movie and come to your own conclusions i hope that you will see the film and i hope that you enjoy it as much as i do thanks for reading br br chris
i'm all for the idea of a grand epic of the american revolutionary war this ain't it and for that matter neither was the emmerich devlin gibson the patriot but i digress br br i saw this film at a publicity screening at the old mgm studios now sony just before it came out the audience had high expectations for this expensive period piece written by veteran robert dillon directed by the esteemed hugh hudson of chariots of fire fame and starring al pacino br br but it didn't take long for people to start squirming in their seats whispering derisive comments about pacino's horribly misconceived accent he was supposed to be an american frontiersman of scottish ancestry and that of nastassja kinski who was supposed to be recently emigrated from england then the story started and it all went downhill fast br br motivations were muddled dialogue was atrocious events had no historical or political context what there was of a plot lurched forward on absurd coincidence by the second or third time that alleged lovers pacino and kinski stumbled into each other it had become a bad joke donald sutherland gave an unhinged performance as a british officer pederast his accent was all over the map too i guess there weren't any english actors available br br lots of people left those who stayed tried to stifle giggles then openly guffawed i stuck it out i figured that at least the battle scenes might be good i was wrong inexplicably hudson chose to film them with hand held cameras not even steadicam the jerkiness giving a misplaced newsreel 'authenticity' which ruined the sense of scale br br there was a semi famous tv reviewer in the audience a few rows ahead of me the late gary franklin of channel 7 eyewitness news i could tell he was peeved by the behavior of the rest of us and sure enough on his tv segment the next day he gave the film a '10' on his notorious 'franklin scale of 1 to 10' while remarking churlishly about the louts who'd disrupted the screening the night before who clearly didn't know art when they saw it what a buffoon br br after this disaster pacino didn't star in another film for almost 4 years hugh hudson's career never recovered you can't say i didn't warn you
the story of peace loving farmers and townspeople fighting for land water law and order and the respect and ultimate subjugation of the long entrenched cattle interests and their hired guns had been worked over better in earlier shane and probably later films as well there's some good action scenes and the general layout of the story excluding a disappointing ending is well executed law and order and religion have established roots in the town but the old order of cattle drives cowboys and gunslingers is still around as well the clash of the two occurs in a nicely staged ambush scene where the townsmen ride right into a trap granger an ex gunfighter plays the guy who is shunned by the very townspeople who need his expertise with a gun
i saw this movie the first time at about twelve o'clock on a saturday evening it really is the perfect time for this one i have never ever seen a movie that was actually more predictable and drenched with stereotypes if you want to see a thrilling action movie don't watch it because you might lose the will to live halfway through however if you want a good laugh please watch it i even bought the chuck norris 3dvd collection thanks to my enjoyable saturday night what especially struck me is that évery scene that would be expensive to make was copy pasted from a discovery documentary or an old tv special on the us army furthermore i was amazed by the fact that they didn't put the slightest effort in making the production look real afghanistan is as far as i can remember nowhere near any sea and yet with a single click deke escapes from the terrorists sand castle with his jet pack and is taken away by a submarine probably discovery later on in the movie deke throws an islam terrorist against the wall in the slow motion scene you can beautifully see the long hairs of the korean stuntman flap in the air when smashed against the wall gotta love it i recommend you watch it with some friends and a good amount of beer though only then you'll understand why i've been mad enough to spend 6 99 euro's on the box
in the sequel to the brilliant bill and ted's excellent adventure bill and ted are under threat from the future as the evil chuck de nomolos sends two evil robots disguised as bill and ted to earth to kill human bill and ted in order to change the future br br in a great comedy pairing winter and reeves excel to deliver delicious humour to the audience in this entertaining sequel though lacking the sharpness of the first bogus journey still has the great catchphrases and dialogue from the leading pair not to mention an hilarious performance by william sadler who brings a humorous side to the figure of depth the grim reaper watch for the games sequences the best moment in the entire film but one of many great techniques used to justify the genre br br though still packed with humour this film has a more dramatic film towards it with stakes being more serious and situations more risky br br this gives the film great dimension and another lovable feature the creators also stretch the boundaries of the fantasy genre and the use of realism with hell and heaven being heavily symbolic and present in the plot the fantasy genre is again spot on with the use of that amazing time travelling machine though again somewhat confusing at points with the use of timing and objects and situations being placed before it happens in the present as is evident in the final couple of scenes br br the first watch i hated this sequel but the second time was a real joy as i appreciated the jokes and story more and though the jokes and plot aren't as strong as its predecessor bogus journey has enough feel good motives jokes and a fairly steady plot to make it a good natured family film
the movie is truly poignant unique and uplifting the story is universal in that it's a battle between good evil and the world between the most important thing is that its rating is wrong misleading and a travesty blockbuster has it rated as though it were an x rated movie the truth is is that it is closer to g than pg and should be seen by children who can read the clear and simple sub titles
this is an art film that was either made in 1969 or 1972 the national film preservation foundation says 1969 and imdb says 1972 regardless of the exact date the film definitely appears to be very indicative of this general time period with some camera work and pop art stylings that are pure late 60s early 70s br br the film consists of three simple images that are distorted using different weird camera tricks these distorted images are accompanied by music and there is absolutely no dialog or plot of any sort this was obviously intended as almost like a form of performance art and like most performance art it's interesting at first but quickly becomes tiresome the film to put it even more bluntly is a total bore and would appeal to no one but perhaps those who made the film their family and friends and perhaps a few people just too hip and with it to be understood by us mortals
the first and only time i saw shades was during a sneakpreview it hadn't even been in premiere i remember there was someone of the directors staff there don't even remember who it was a belgian movie we never heard of it so we were quite neutral not knowing what to expect mickey rourke is a brilliant actor and he's stands miles ahead all the rest he plays an actor who's star has long stopped rising he's helping to realise a movie in belgium entitled shades br br as soon as the movie started we noticed how much swearing there is nothing against the occasional swear word however this was way beyond annoying whenever rourke uses the f word to express something it comes naturally however when someone from the cast a non english speaker uses the f or s word it becomes arrogant and aggressive br br we quickly lost count of how many times they used the f and s words everybody was just glad to be out of the theatre and we had to give a vote but it was hard for us because it was only from 0 to 10 and we were looking for the 10
i saw this in the summer of 1990 i'm still annoyed by how bad this movie is in 2001 br br implausible plot you'd have to be a child to think this could happen br br i'm just really annoyed by it don't see this
the movie atlantis the lost empire is a shining gem in the rubble of films produced by the disney studios recently parents who have had to sit through the jungle book 2 or even a pokemon movie will surely appreciate this one br br the film is one of few to attempt at an original story previous feature films were merely re tellings of existing stories films such as toy story finding nemo and monsters inc all do the same but it must be noted that all were made by pixar and only distributed by disney recent films from the disney studios are mostly released direct to video and are sequels to an existing successful film the quality of those films is given way to the profitability a new era started with atlantis following it were mulan lilo stitch and most recently open range the writers have created all original story lines instead of the fairy tales of the past br br a good portion of the movie is devoted to the quest to find atlantis a task that has captured the imagination of many for hundreds of years including that of young milo thatch voiced by michael j fox milo is employed by a museum in washington d c his grandfather was a renowned archaeologist who had devoted his life to discovering atlantis this was seen as a waste by his peers and they wish milo to not follow in his footsteps after failing to convince the museum board of directors to sponsor his expedition milo comes home to find a woman in his darkened apartment she takes him to her employer a mr whitmore whitmore was a close friend of milo's grandfather and wishes to send milo with a team to locate atlantis mr whitmore is very wealth and has paid for the best of everything the crew that is to accompany him is the same as his grandfathers the journey is filled with many great obstacles to overcome and is great fun to watch the viewer finds themselves caught up in if they will reach atlantis the plot takes an unexpected turn after the discovery atlantis not just the discovery of people it is enough to keep the interest of the older audience br br the animators have done a wonderful job in then depth of the animation the movie is very successful in blending traditional animation with computer generated images a feat not easily achieved most audiences are quick to notice the difference in the two the characters are believably human there are some nice chase type scenes with lots of action going on a few lulls are filled with jokes that the children just may not get br br the creativity of the writers really shines through the culture of atlantis is richly developed including an entire language the film uses references to atlantis from historical sources such as plato the disappearance of atlantis from the world is explained believable if by a younger audience that magic really does exist the powers of the people of atlantis are not exactly presented as magic but can best be described in this way br br although set in 1914 the level of technology used is unrealistic the voyage is in a submarine very reminiscent of captain nemo's nautilus complete with sub pods that fire torpedoes the giant diggers are driven by steam boilers so they did try for some era technology the female characters are empowered in a way that women of the age would not have been even holding roles in leadership this is not a bad thing it gives a good role model for my daughter to look to rather than an all male cast br br one reason this film is a favorite of mine over other disney films is that there is not one single song ever a tradition that began with the first feature film snow white and carried on through to the lion king almost every disney film is full of upbeat songs this is great and all what would the seven dwarfs be without hi ho after the millionth time through it'd almost be better without but this one spares the parent not once does every single person on the screen suddenly know the words to a song that no one has ever heard before and break out in song i for one am grateful br br the storyline and depth of animation is sure to keep the attention of both parent and child alike it is a film i am willing to watch again and again with my children
i give this five out of 10 all five marks are for hendrix who delivers a very decent set of his latter day material unfortunately the quality of the camera work and editing is verging on the appalling we have countless full face shots of hendrix where he could almost be doing anything taking a pee perhaps we don't see his hands on the guitar thats the point also we're given plenty shots of hendrix from behind there appears to be three cameras on hendrix but amateur fools operate all of them the guy in front of hendrix seems to be keen to wander his focus lazily about the stage as if hendrix on the guitar is a mere distraction while the guy behind is keener on zeroing in on a few chicks in the stalls than actually documenting the incredible guitar work thats bleeding out the amps the sound recording is good thanks to wally heider interspersed on the tracks are clips of student losers protesting against vietnam etc on tracks like machine gun complete waste of film if hendrix had lived even another two years berkeley is one of those things that would never have seen the light of day as far as a complete official release goes the one gem it does contain is the incredible johnny b good but all in a pretty poor visual document of the great man and inferior to both woodstock and isle of wight
just look at the poor robert webber character great performance once again who tries to wrestle a sub machine gun from one of the terrorists everything in this movie seems to be a little wrong the biggest mistake in my opinion is the effort to give the action a firm footing in the actuality of the early 1980ies the fundamental difference between this flick and the far more fantastic ironic and therefore timeless die hard the story comes through as a failed attempt to glorify the sas commandos ideas like when a commando shouts heads down all good guys do it and all bad guys don't so that they can blast away ad lib with a good conscience that the main character does not get mown down by the gas masked commandos although he wears the same clothes and carries a weapon from their arsenal just seem to be unlikely and make it hard to take the movie seriously and it just happens that it tries to be more than just fun don't talk about the toilet mirror signal episode br br i don't mind the criticism of the pacifist movement as a shield for evildoers and the arguments between the peace fanatics and the settled even headed representatives of power in this movie but the political comment is rather lame and uninspired this is insofar regrettable as the movie features an early performance of judy davies she plays the main fanatic and seems to have done extensive studies on the subject anyway her performance is a notch above that of the others and somehow i feel the movie let her down
yes the cameras were in the right place at the right time it's so interesting to see how a world leader like chavez who supports the poor people in his country can be held in such low esteem in the us his worst sin in my opinion is caring about those who are at the bottom of the barrel what can be so bad about that i have always been fascinated by the us government media reaction to fidel castro at first castro was a good guy around 1959 when he supplanted batista soon however castro started turning the corporations in cuba toward the needs of the poor instead of the fat cats we're a decent country but why does our media and government have such a problem with sharing with the poor if these guys are dictators then we could use more dictatorships especially where the poorest of the poor live in the world
ok ok don't get bent out of round i was kidding br br bustin' out is actually a better and truer title anyhoo br br racism and crime dramas get the satiric treat meant from our x rated animator friend ralphie boy and he does one of his better jobs here br br on the crime front it shows the truth they build it defend it then boredom and stronger rivals cause them to maybe lose it see for yourself to see what goes down br br racist i don't know with scatman rip and the love walrus also rip being black and the main point of view i saw it as an attack on racism mostly the fact that richard pryor liked it says as much as well and the younger pre miami vice phil mike thomas in there was a nice surprise br br it's an animated blacksploitation film that's a good thing done well and well done it will make some squirm like the lynching scene but unfortunately that's based on fact br br but ralphie really should have re thought that title
i first saw this movie when i was a freshman in high school and the film has stuck with me through the years it's not about the soundtrack or cinematography or even the dialogue and somewhat bad acting it's about the educational purpose and the message behind that is the most important it's not a sin to have a child when you're a teenager and still in high school and it's not really a bad thing either but it is a problem tons of girls i knew are all having children now and i guess they never watched this great movie and if they did they clearly didn't get the message behind it all it's about not taking chances when you're in a sexual relationship any girl can get pregnant the first time it's not a myth you don't necessarily lose out on your dreams but they do have to take a backseat in your future because you have a child to think about first br br this movie has a clear message behind it just say no
at the point in time that the lady from shanghai was being made the marriage of orson welles and rita hayworth was disintegrating the film was as much an effort by welles to rekindle the old flames as it was to make a classic noir not received well at the time the lady from shanghai has gotten more and more critical acclaim as years pass gotten better with age so to speak br br welles is irish seaman michael o'hara who on a fateful night rescues the beautiful rita hayworth from three muggers in central park sparks do fly but then comes the rub turns out the lady is married to crippled but brilliant criminal attorney everett sloane nevertheless sloane takes an apparent liking to welles and hires him to skipper his yacht br br so far this film is starting to sound a lot like gilda if orson had seen gilda and was not at this point thinking with his male member he would have skedaddled back to the seaman's hiring hall in lower manhattan instead he gets himself involved in a lovely web or intrigue and finds himself pegged for two murders and sloane as his eminent counsel br br welles for whatever reason decided that his wife would be a blond in this film supposedly harry cohn hit the roof as rita was internationally known for her coppery red hair this may have soured him on the picture as he joined the legion of studio bosses who saw welles's vision of independent film making a threat to their power br br stage actor glenn anders plays sloane's partner grisby who is one slimy dude he winds up a corpse the other corpse to be here is ted decorsia a bottom feeding private detective who tries to go in business for himself br br it's a good noir thriller showing rita at her glamorous best even if she was a blond here the final shoot out in the hall of mirrors is beautifully staged but i wouldn't recommend seeing it if one is on any controlled substance
the first time you see the second renaissance it may look boring look at it at least twice and definitely watch part 2 it will change your view of the matrix are the human people the ones who started the war is ai a bad thing
i first watched this movie on its release in 1987 and was greatly affected emotionally through a combination of guilt at what my fellow white human beings could do to innocent people and the reluctance of the outside world to really investigate these atrocities against man br br particularly moving was the funeral of steve biko made even more vivid and hard hitting by the south african anthem played at the time i have long believed that this movie achieved what nobody else had managed to open the eyes of the world to what was really happening in south africa i consider myself to be a normal right thinking person and i can attest to how this film changed my whole way of thinking about not just south africa but how we as white people perceive black people i have never seen any difference between people of any colour or creed but after viewing this film i physically changed my life and have spent the last 17 years living in a predominantly black country and helping many people rise above their present standard of living and achieve that which they would not have thought possible the greatest reward i can honestly say i have received to be able to say that in my own small way i have contributed and redressed the balance a little but if more people thought like me and actually did something to help black people without seeking reward then the entire black population of this planet would be a little better off br br i challenge any right thinking person to watch cry freedom from beginning to end and not feel that emotion tugging at your heartstrings as you witness the 700 schoolchildren brutally shot dead in sharpville for refusing to learn afrikaans the senseless murder of steve biko such a champion for his own people's rights and then ultimately to understand that all this is not merely a film albeit a magnificent one but that it all actually happened and less than 30 years ago br br yes my friends watch this movie and then see if you can go out afterwards and party hard i couldn't i was too upset at knowing the truth that is the hallmark of a great film it was obviously the intention of sir richard attenborough to get this message over about south africa of course he has achieved it unless you happen to support apartheid god help you
this is one of the shallowest episodes in that the plot really seemed like an excuse to just have fun but i appreciated this light hearted approach and this is truly one of the best episodes to see on a purely fun level think about it the crew members have encounters with the white rabbit and alice from wonderland a bengal tiger a samurai warrior a knight on horseback who kills mccoy and a host of other seemingly bizarre events that just don't make any sense at all until the very end despite all the danger you just can't take everything very seriously it's just too fun and the whole episode seems very surreal so on a purely non aesthetic level it's great stuff
i typically don't like reality shows particularly the ones that are profiting off of american idol 's success but this one i can live with br br comedians from all around the world perform a brief routine for celebrity talent scouts and if they like them those guys will be sent to perform a routine for an actual audience then ten or twelve comics are selected to live in a house together and do survivor style competitions using comedic tactics then one will be determined as last comic standing i do like stand up comedy so this is the one reality show must keen to my interests there are usually some pretty funny comics selected through it started the careers of such talents as alonzo bodden ralphie may and josh blue br br my negative criticisms is the fact that there is the possibility that a lot of these comics were selected for their contribution to reality show drama at first they lived together in a house like big brother but now they've done away with that thank god br br and there are a lot of comedians i felt were only chosen not because they're funny but because of race ethnicity attitude sex etc when other comics clearly should've beaten them out but overall it's a well made reality show which are two terms up until now i thought were an oxymoron
ok first the good cher's performance and the cinematography although i'm no cher fan she gives an excellent performance and her part was well written the cinematography was well done and captures a sense of romance br br the rest a thin plotline nicholas cage's performance and a totally unhumorous and weak attempt to portray an italian american family from new york firstly everytime time cage opened his mouth i cringed i don't know what kind of accent he was trying use i honestly don't it sure wasnt any new york or italian accent i've ever heard it was quite surreal and it wasn't because i'm some stickler for accuracy his voice just cloyed in my ears and i like nicholas cage in other performances secondly and this is purely anecdotal but i have many italian relations friends and acquaintances in new york city and frankly i've gotten more laughs and felt more joy in the appreciation of the italian ethnic family by far than this movie provided and that would be on a boring night at the house what a let down
each of the major studios cranked out jazzy one reelers throughout the thirties and forties with universal taking the lead while most looked as cheap on screen as they were to make warner bros which abruptly stopped making them in 1946 often distinguished theirs with offbeat camera angles mirrors and optical effects thanks to some creative directors like jean negulesco it is fitting that the best of this genre should come from this studio br br what sets jammin' the blues apart from the rest of the pack is that it more closely resembles an avant garde experiment than a hollywood musical filmed in july 1944 it transforms an ordinary jam session into a trippy dream escape from war time troubles highlighted by the tune of on the sunny side of the street gjon mili and cameraman robert burkes later to work with hitchcock were allowed plenty of artistic freedom perhaps because lester young was not glenn miller and the studio could care less how he and his fellow musicians were presented the optical printer is put to good use with multiple images of the same performer appearing at once norman mclaren really milked this process two decades later in pas de deux while linwood dunn's team achieved different effects in citizen kane the strong emphasis on silhouettes and lit cigarette smoke was also ahead of its time in some ways this predated the psychedelic sixties but with a distinctly forties film noir style
the third collaboration for karloff and lugosi sees a move away from poe and into the realm of the science fiction serial karloff plays dr janos rukh creator of a device that can capture light rays through his telescope in the carpathian mountains and translate them into pictures that form a visual history of the universe br br before several guests including lugosi as dr benet an astro chemist who had previously scoffed at rukh's theories he demonstrates the existence of an unknown radioactive element here termed radium x contained in a meteor that fell to earth in darkest africa several thousand years ago karloff joins the expedition to prove his theories but radium x is a tricky compound it levels mountains at long range and cures blindness at short range rukh is careless however and poisons himself glowing in the dark rather like those old ready breck commercials dr benet is on hand to devise a counter active for the radiation but combination of poison and cure drives rukh insanely paranoid convinced he has been cheated he seeks out the members of the expedition in paris including his estranged wife and his very touch while in his radioactive state means death br br along the way we get the old pseudo scientific idea that a dead person's eyes record the image of their killer a remarkably distinct karloff and the radium x device used to symbolically melt statues that represent the expedition members and even a touch of james whale in a cockney landlady in paris br br the invisible ray is great fun aside from the gothic opening it's interesting to see universal move the action around to africa and paris the film lacks pace but is always absorbing karloff slightly overdoes his performance but lugosi is terrific universal used the basic story outline again in man made monster this time with lon chaney jr as the glowing menace this time caused by electricity and lionel atwill as a much madder doctor than lugosi is here the invisible ray is a sombre and clever little film with much to admire not as famous as other universal horrors perhaps but it works and is highly entertaining
it is a rare occasion when i want to see a movie again the amati girls is such a movie in old time movie theaters i would have stayed put for more showings was this story autobiographical for the writer director it has the aura of reality br br the all star cast present their characters believably and with tenderness who would not want mercedes ruehl as an older sister i have loved her work since for roseanna br br with most movies one suspends belief because we know that it is the work of actors producers directors sound technicians etc it was hard to suspend such belief in the amati girls one feels such a part of this family how i wanted to come to the defense of dolores when her family is stifling her emotional life and wanted to cheer lee grant as she levels criticism at cloris leachman's hair color the humor throughout is not belly laugh humor but instead has a feel good quality that satisfies far more than pratfalls and such br br the love that is portrayed in this cinema family is to be emulated and cherished br br it is no coincidence that the family name amati translated from the italian means 'the loved ones'
the only reason i even gave it a 1 out of 10 is because the option to give it zero out of 10 was not allowed this was the biggest waste of time i've ever endured for roughly 75 minutes you are subjected to the worst acting and i don't mean that in a good way either like as in killer nerd which had great horrible acting and a plot that is not only ridiculous but also has absolutely nothing to do with a massacre the reason i even rented this piece of crap was because it has massacre in the title that said there was only one killing in the entire movie and it was pretty lame at that you spend more time watching the kids bickering and doing yard work than anything speaking of the kids the little boy actor is probably the most irritating child actor since bob from house by the cemetery did i mention it was shot on video as well if you want to throw away money and over an hour of your life then by all means watch it but if you savor your hard earned dollars and time then stray as far away as possible

alexandr sascha luzhin john turturro is a former leading chess player attempting a comeback at an italy hosted tournament his brilliance is unquestioned but his obsession with chess has stunted his growth in all other aspects of his life natalia emily watson is a beautiful heiress who has come to the same resort with her mother vera geraldine james to scope out possible marriage partners vera leans toward a handsome count but astonishingly natalia is more fascinated by sascha whom she met on a walk sascha too is taken with natalia and proposes marriage at their second meeting but with the concentration that sascha must give to the chess matches and with other happenings in his past still causing problems will he win the heart of natalia oh and can he become the chess champion also this is a lovely film based on a novel by nabokov the acting is amazing with watson very fine as the beautiful little rich girl and turturro utter perfection as the shy awkward chess enthusiast james gives quite a nice turn as the overbearing mother and the other cast members are wonderful as well as for the look of the film it could not be better the scenery is of the put your eye out variety the vintage costumes are gorgeous and the cinematography is deserving of much applause yes the story is unusual and told with the use of flashbacks at times making it a film not everyone will appreciate then too the ending is bittersweet however if you love romance period pieces great acting knockout scenery or the fine art of motion picture creation don't miss this one you will be defenseless in resisting its multitude of charms
okay now what the hell is this supposed to be is it a family fantasy movie to cash in further on the huge success of spielberg's close encounters of the third kind or a throwback to the glorious days of prehistoric epics such as when dinosaurs ruled the earth and the lost world perhaps it's an intellectual philosophical masterpiece we all fail to comprehend yes that must be it whatever it is the creators of the day time ended good old john 'bud' cardos of kingdom of the spiders and writer david schmoeller of tourist trap must have been sniffing quite a lot glue when they penned down the ideas for this demented hodgepodge of genres the story doesn't make the slightest bit of sense and the narrative structure is incoherent as hell but hey who cares as long as it's got papier mâché dinosaurs miniature spacecrafts headache inducing light laser shows and spontaneously combusting supernovas the voice over introduction is practically inaudible but no worries as it's all gibberish did you know that the definition of 'time' isn't what we all think it is time doesn't necessarily pass by chronologically it is one giant paradox words that were spoken thousands of years ago are still floating around now and even things that will happen in the future are already surrounding us i have absolutely no idea what all this means but apparently it provides an easy excuse to gather tap dancing midget aliens and well mannered dinosaurs on screen together i deliberately say well mannered dinosaurs because at a certain point one of the prehistoric monsters politely knocks on the front door before menacing his targets the crazy plot revolves on a family of weirdos living in their solar powered house in the middle of nowhere grandpa is extremely annoying the granddaughter even more granny is a walking talking advertisement billboard for plastic surgery the youngest son strangely resembles prince valiant and the young mother is  incredibly hot chris mitchum for some reason also pointless wanders around the filming sets as the hot mommy's husband on business travel the special effects are purely cheesy and absolutely laughable i sincerely hope that the other reviewer who talked about excellent special effects was being sarcastic but the absolute most genius aspect here are the dialogs just read this wondrous example of extraordinary writing br br grandpa you know what this is don't you this is a time space warp br br stevie i'm not quite sure if i know what that means dad br br grandpa well i guess nobody really does br br make up your mind gramps do you know what it is or don't you and stop talking about the vortex like you're some kind of expert in the field the day time ended is an incredibly childish and not worth bothering for fantasy movie though i can totally understand that some of its fans cherish the film because they saw it at young age and became fascinated with the flamboyant effects the ending completely comes out of nowhere like they suddenly ran out of money or like the effects of the mushrooms they were eating wore out unexpectedly
frailty is a non gory horror film that achieves its chills by following the logic and impact of a man's delusion obsession straight into depravity dad we never learn his name is a gentle man and loving father who's raising his sons alone after mom died giving birth to the youngest son adam the family's world flips upside down late one night when dad rushes into the boys' room and tells them god has given him a vision and what a vision  the entire family's job is to destroy demons who of course are disguised in human form br br proceeding from this premise the movie is unflinching in following it dad kidnaps people demons whom god has told him to destroy binds them lays his hand on them to see a vision of their evil then kills them  while making his young sons watch fenton the older boy is horrified seeing only a father who's turned into a crazed murderer adam the younger is uncomfortable but trusts that dad is following god's will eventually dad takes his sons on missions to abduct the demons that god has put on dad's list and finally invites them to fully participate in god's mission for the family br br this is not you understand an abusive father he loves his children he is only following god's instructions this is our job now son we've got to do this when fenton terrified and convinced his father has gone mad says he'll report him to the police his father explains if you do that son i'll die the angel was clear on this the pressure that the children are under is unbearable and tragic and warps their entire lives 1 the movie's structure is similar to the one used in the usual suspects a story in flashback told in a police station to a fbi agent the moody lighting the stormy weather and the eerie calm in the present day add to the menace of the backstory i wanted to believe the unfolding horror was just a story until i remembered the real life parallel of andrea yates who believed she was possessed by satan and could save her children by drowning them even then i wanted to believe that i was watching a human tragedy rather than a story of divine retribution br br the movie gave me no such comfort though as it gave strong clues at the end about the veracity of dad's vision and this as much as some plot holes posed a problem for me regardless of the accuracy of dad's visions regardless of the evil that his victims may have committed where does anyone derive the authority to act as an angel of death 1 roger ebert review 4 12 02
here's one you can watch with a straight face with a script so bad even will ferrell wouldn't be in it br br there are two laughs in hot rod br br 1 the punch dance rod needs to go to his quiet place and before anyone can say kevin bacon he is footloosing a passionate overwrought bodyswerve to the strains of a band who wishes they had the big hair faux metal chops of europe br br 2 john farnham's you're the voice in one of those epic sequences where the star and his cohorts do the slomo walk down main street and the townfolk follow on their heels in support the soundtrack is the gag how did the film makers even come across this aussie recording artist a major australian vocalist and a genuine talent who shot to fame in the early '70s covering raindrops keep fallin' on my head then disappeared until 1986 for the big comeback with you're the voice john farnham's anthem is so bewitchingly cheesy it leveled mountains in switzerland br br besides these two high points in the film both ruined anyway with the slipshod writing the rest of the film is like choking on someone else's vomit br br andy samberg is rod a failed stunt jumper who has never made a jump maybe it's got something to do with the fact he's driving a moped into the heart of darkness or his fake mustache yeh someone actually thought that was funny br br without one jump under his starry belt he plans for a 15 bus extravaganza which would surely kill a lesser bad comedian like jason biggs or rob schneider to win the day and save his stepfather and simultaneously wipe out cancer and whatever who watches these movies for plot anyway along the way as usual for moronic leads in these comedies he scores a salubrious chick isla fisher who must surely be retarded to consider swapping chromosomes with this loser br br sissy spacek carrie 1976 has so little to do she almost phoned in her performance then changed her mind and just hung up ian mcshane must've lost a bet to be here
hollywood hotel is a fast moving exuberant wonderfully entertaining musical comedy from warners which is sadly overlooked it should be remembered if only for providing the official theme song of tinseltown hooray for hollywood the score by richard whiting and johnny mercer has a number of other gems however including the charming i'm like a fish out of water and silhouetted in the moonlight the best musical number is let that be a lesson to you in which dick powell and company detail the misadventures of people who found themselves behind the eight ball a fate which literally befalls slow burning edgar kennedy at the number's end the picture celebrates hollywood glamour and punctures it all at once as it gets a lot of comic mileage out of pompous and ego maniacal actors and duplicitous studio executives the cast includes a gaggle of great character comedians allyn joslyn as a crafty press agent ted healy as dick powell's would be manager fritz feld as an excitable restaurant patron glenda farrell as mona marshall's sarcastic gal friday edgar kennedy as a put upon drive in manager mabel todd as mona's goofy sister and hugh herbert as her even goofier dad the racist element mentioned in another review here is a ten second bit where herbert appears in black face during a pseudo gone with the wind sequence it's in questionable taste but it shouldn't prevent you from seeing the other delights in this film notably the benny goodman quartet including teddy wilson and lionel hampton in what i believe is the only footage available on this incredible jazz combo the dark eyes sequence goes on a bit too long and comes in too late but otherwise hollywood hotel is a gem well worth your time and certainly a film which should be considered for dvd release
my scalp still smarts from the burning coals heaped on it when i vowed i love this film bring on the coals i'll walk over them as well to say again that i love bend it like beckham granted there's a lot of in spite of in that confession it's a bit movie of the week the screenplay is on the paint by numbers side and most troublingly the director's commentary implies that in this film beauty can be found primarily amongst the white of skin br br the film's genius is not in what's obvious to the syd field doctored eye character arcs themes construction it's in both the surface and what lurks deep beneath but not in those layers of artistic topsoil that reviewers seem most often to scratch at powerful sometimes semi clad female bodies not simply on display but kicking the crap out of a football do a better job of naturalizing female strength and agility than lara croft or zhang ziyi will ever do these are real bodies keira knightley's excepted whose work is not to look great first and kick butt later they are working bodies whose beauty is in their movement and self determination and in my book lead actress parminder nagra is one of the most gorgeous creatures ever captured on screen  not only because she can lay claim to that hackneyed adjective luminous but because her performance has an honesty and un bookish intelligence that's utterly compelling br br the result is a film women can enjoy without feeling like they're making a pact with the devil to do so as in chadha's bride and prejudice the relationships amongst women sizzle with a chemistry that can't be neatly slotted into the stodgy sweet valley high categories of best friends or sisters perhaps chadha is even right in her commentary to disavow the film's flirtation with lesbianism bend it like beckham has an electricity that can't be reduced to the simple hetero homosexual love triangle its conventionally structured script would suggest the precise nature of its pleasure is ultimately a bit of a mystery  and is all the more seductive for it br br oh yes and did i mention that it's hilarious
well it's robin hood as 'geezer' all right just as advertised that didn't sound very hopeful and alas it was worse than i'd suspected br br a laddish robin i can take a robin who tangles with a pert dyer's daughter i can credit but a robin who exchanges not very funny banter with his single henchman is harder to swallow and a robin and entire cast who seem to be having difficulty managing their lines is the kiss of doom how could anyone let such laboured delivery pass without re shooting the scenes again and again much sounds as if he's struggling with half comprehended shakespeare rather than letting loose with a salty quip i hoped at the onset that it was just a failed comedy trait in a character clearly destined for the role of comedy sidekick but then it started spreading throughout the rest of the cast br br whatever else you say about errol flynn in the role he had the knack of delivering high flown dialogue as naturally as if he'd just thought it up on the spur of the moment and as this production shows that's not at all as easy as it sounds if they were going to cast the characters as cheeky chappies the actors in question should have been given appropriate lines they sound as if they haven't a clue how to handle them br br i'm afraid i didn't even like the pantomime sheriff for a similar reason the lines are clearly not intended to be taken seriously but delivered and in this case written with a nudge and a wink at the audience they're out of place all right fourth wall busting stuff but really not that funny br br this much promised production reminded me of a limping school play the only actor and character i felt any appreciation for at all was the one playing guy of gisbourne who was the sole one who appeared to have any handle on a credible villainy and b credible characterisation but frankly i wouldn't have said that was a very good augury for the future of the series as of the time of writing i'll give it another shot in the hopes that things may improve and bed down a bit by next week with less stilted scene setting required and perhaps the actors more at ease with the dialogue after all the opening episode of doctor who wasn't exactly a show stopper though it was nowhere near as bad as this but if i see no improvement after episode 2 i'm afraid the series has almost certainly lost one viewer br br which would be a pity because i've got a soft spot for the robin hood legend on screen from the adventures of douglas fairbanks to the sturdy reliance of richard greene but this robin fails to stir my blood in the slightest
you know the story pretty kids alone in the woods when bam something starts cutting them up br br well this crap is no different a bunch of kids return to a cabin where the male leads twin brother disappeared for years before suddenly an unkown creature stars cutting them up and their only help is a doctor biker br br to say this film was bad is an understatement it's smut the acting was horrible br br the creature looked very cheesy and as all films do these days they try to get you with a twist ending which they do not br br there is one bright spot to this film lost star maggie grace as the female lead
this movie is about development people growing and people fading people surprising and people disappointing it has it all and more there is hope frustration injustice justice love and hate it is truly a classic drama that has fantastic performances from the whole cast but especially whoopi goldberg in her debut role br br this movie made me feel very human and proud of it and i suggest that this movie should be mandatory each saturday in all prisons in the world it touches your compassion rating 10 of 10 br br ps i admit it i shed a tear of joy during the final scene
and an extremely bad one at that how long did this train wreck last 14 episodes or something i can see why now br br i bought the serenity episode from amazon unboxed it was my first purchase so was free that is the only good thing about the experience incident br br i won't comment really on the acting since these were i guess fairly new people who hadn't really gotten the job down just right yet at least i've never seen them before in any type of major show theater or tv if i did then i have easily forgotten them br br but the special effects were absolutely horrendous true this isn't exactly a multi million project but the original star trek did better than this that was thirty five years ago i especially got a laugh out of the bad guys reapers or something like that ship as it chased the hilarious looking firefly with smoke coming out of the engines looking something like a gigantic model rocket i fully expected to eventually see the wiley coyote riding on top while chasing after the roadrunner modern jet rocket engines don't even do it that bad br br and that wasn't even the worst of it the wild west type shoot outs had me wondering if i was actually watching a sci fi film or a gene autry one br br regardless of the hype don't waste your time i did all 80 something minutes of the disaster called firefly
billed as a kind of sequel to the full monty about unemployed men in sheffield this movie is a fake br br as someone born in sheffield and still with links to the city i was extremely disappointed by this film someone said it could have been set in oklahoma and that just about sums it up for me this looked like a romantic view of northern england made for the us market probably many americans and many southern english people don't realize that sheffield is a big city of around half a million inhabitants with a sophisticated urban culture in among giants it was depicted as some dreary dead end semi rural small town where everyone in sheffield seemed to drink in the same old fashioned pub and where the people's idea of a party was line dancing in some village hall lookalike this was a small close knit community not a metropolitan city br br the working class sheffield men were totally unlike their real life counterparts who are generally taciturn and communicate with each other in grunts and brief dry remarks they don't chatter and they certainly don't sing in choirs br br even the rural settings supposedly in the peak district looked alien to me i recognized a few places where i used to go hiking but some of the aerial shots of pylons stretching out over a bleak landscape reminded me more of wales indeed in the credits at the end i spotted a reference to gwynedd wales the peak district is in the summer crawling with walkers and tourists in cars it is situated between two big cities it is not some kind of wilderness br br as for the notion that a young woman could fall in love with and lust after pete postlethwaite that was ludicrous and could only have been a male dream her reasons for becoming his lover were never made apparent none of the men was shown as having a partner or families they existed in a vacuum br br anyone wanting to see a film about unemployed sheffielders would have been led astray this sheffield existed only in the minds of its middle class writers and film makers br br it was a gigantic fake br br
writer director peter greenaway cements his title as the high lord of art house pretension with his latest exercise in obnoxious self indulgence 8 ½ women the film follows a wealthy englishman and his son on their mutual quest for sexual satisfaction as they lure and blackmail women guess how many into joining their personal collection of concubines br br think of any possible way that this premise could be offensive and chances are greenaway's done it the female characters are little more than a catalogue of fetishes for the two protagonists to partake of there's the kabuki obsessed mio the ever pregnant giaconda and beryl who's got a thing for farm animals giulietta has no legs and uses a wheelchair she's the half woman get it greenaway vehemently denies all accusations of misogyny but if this isn't it then what is br br the film goes on to eroticize anything and everything having to do with japan a continuation of themes from his snore worthy but less sexist 1996 film the pillow book but where the the pillow book was erotic and graceful 8 ½ women just gets horny and exploitative greenaway's work is tasteless and arrogant in its fetishism and the only person likely to enjoy watching it is the auteur himself
rock n roll high school holds a special place in my heart because it introduced me to the ramones i was too young during the band's mid 70s heyday to be very aware of them although i had an older cousin who was a big fan at the time i finally saw rnrhs on television one afternoon in the mid 80s when i was about fifteen years old and laughed all the way through it isn't it every high school kid's dream to trash his school and blow it up all set to a rockin' soundtrack i recorded a subsequent airing of the film a year or two later and kept watching the ramones concert sequences over and over again thinking man these guys kick ass i have to check out some of their albums the rest is history twenty years umpteen ramones lps cassettes cds and three ramones shows later they're still one of my all time favorite bands and rnrhs still cracks me up every time i watch it now that joey dee dee and johnny have left us r i p all at least we have this movie and tons of great music to remember them by
one of my favorite movies to date starts as an adventure through the wild side of a team of four men from atlanta the idea of living the chulawasse river before it's turned into a lake comes from burt reynold's lewis who unconsciously drowns his fellas into their worst nightmare but if the first half of the film appears rather like an action movie the second half carries the viewer into a totally different story with our men forced to make a decision that they know will change their lives forever in very bad ways at the end of the movie each person is gonna be forced to deal with the scars of what had just to be a quite week end on the river but muted into a fight for survival the movie except some pretty evident goofs is very well directed and beautifully shot into a paradise of nature that steals your breath the photography is excellent as well voight reynolds cox and beatty are all excellent in showing how a single event can ruin in different ways four different lives only tied to the same mistake
a killer cannibal rapist is killed by a crazed cop on the scene of his latest murder at his grave a cult have gathered with plans to resurrect him by peeing onto the grave this of course works and he awakes ripping the guys penis off and he is back into his old killing ways with an all new zombie look the two cops one of who is going a little crazy about the scum of the city and has a drug problem are back on the case two of the original cult member also tries to stop the killer by resurrecting some other kind of dead thing thinking they have filed they leave but out from the grave comes a plastic baby doll that was used in the original resurrection sounds a bit confusing really but no its just rubbish br br the acting is terrible and one of the cops is the same guy that plays dr vincent van gore in the faces of gore series and he is just as terrible as the annoying cop in this film the other cop just about struggles to get his terrible lines out now i'm all for low budget cinema but this film is just terrible if it wasn't for the very easy on the eye ladies and their nakedness i would probably have fallen asleep there is a bit of gore but it's never more than some animal guts placed on the stomach of the victims the zombie makeup on the other hand looks great and his foot long penis that he uses to rape his victims with is kind of funny at times there is also a half decent scene where the killer falls in love with a sex doll the doll with the chipmunks voice is the stupidest thing i have ever seen in a film it is just a plastic toy on a fishing line br br the ending is extremely bad you would expect the killer to put up much more of a fight than he does god knows how they made enough money to make a sequel br br 4 10
i had a chance to see a screening of this movie recently i believe that it will be in theaters in canada some time around mother's day if it is in a theater near you go it's not a funny feel good movie it's more along the lines of a feel and think movie br br the director does an excellent job of character development letting you into the heart mind and hurts of hagar little by little at first her attitudes and behaviors don't make much sense as her story unfolds she becomes someone you can understand as in life understanding brings empathy i found her likable by the end of the movie particularly when she opens up her heart to the young man in the shack by the lake br br hagar's relationship with her two sons is painful and reflective of so many of our own experiences in this world her youngest son john who is full of life and adventure takes the viewer to the very edge of their seat and into the kind of raw emotion that is so authentic and rare br br it's fun to see ellen page acting in this movie she is so very different than the young woman that she plays in juno it gives me an even broader appreciation for her acting ability if you loved her in juno you'll love her in the stone angel br br of course there is ellen burnstyn as hagar there is likely no way of expressing the power of acting as strongly as the ability for the actor to make you forget every other character they have ever played never once in the course of this movie did i ever think of ellen burnstyn i always and only thought of hagar she swept me into her character hook line and sinker br br kari skogland's capacity to capture on film this renowned book by one of canada's most cherished authors is impressive she brilliantly brings to the screen both the stoney and angelic parts of this complex woman hagar the stone angel
normally i'm not motivated to write reviews but this movie was so excruciatingly painful i feel i must i cringed at the appallingly predictable plot the lame acting and laughed at moments which were supposed to be tense indeed most of the audience seemed pretty bored and chatty even at the most tense moment of the movie molly ringwald stood out as the only performance of any merit in a tortured production even the twist at the end wasn't i've heard it said that the movie didn't take itself seriously but i could find little evidence of that in the movie br br cut should have been left on the cutting room floor do yourself a favour and spend your time and money on something else
i'm a jean harlow fan because she had star quality i don't think her movies are good and i don't even think that she was a good actress but she certainly was great in comedies every bit of comedy in the girl from missouri is very good but this movie is perhaps more like a love story jean harlow is wonderful in this one and you can forget the rest of the cast their performances bring nothing new it always impresses me much to think that harlow's beautiful body was that of an ill woman well in this movie she does look beautiful
this is a quite slow paced movie slowly building the story of an ex stripper who begins a new family life with a complete stranger the viewer slowly feels that there's something wrong here br br i really loved this movie even though it leaves a slight bitter taste in the end it is clever well paced and very well acted both philippe toretton and emmannuelle seigner are deeply into their characters br br the little son pierrot is also very touching br br a thriller which does not seem like one a very unconventional movie very particular atmosphere throughout the whole movie though you might feel awkward a few times with a couple of scenes br br i'll give it a 8 10
i just watched the 30th anniversary edition of blazing saddles one of my all time favorites the tv pilot for black bart stunk the plot was non existent and the acting was not good it was obviously an attempt to profit off of the success of blazing saddles and there have been tv shows that have succeeded in doing take offs of big movies but this one would never have worked considering that for so many years tv would not even play the farting noises when they televised the movie it is inconceivable that they thought they could put a show on tv with the n word thrown around on the other hand i enjoyed seeing a lot of familiar faces there were quite a few actors actresses that i recognized from other shows over the years i had to write down all the names and do a few searches that was fun i was arguing with my mother if steve landesberg was from barney miller or mash i won
addictive is an adjective i've heard many times when talking of certain tv shows most recently dramas like lost heroes and prison break have earned that description however as compelling as they may be and they really are i can wait a few days before i see the next episode of either series even prison break which some have lazily classified as the new 24 with all due respect there can be no such thing and for a good reason no other silver screen thriller is based on a real time structure that's what sets 24 apart from any other show and that's why i practically have to watch an entire season on dvd in seven days or less once the frickin' clock starts ticking it's impossible to tune out br br an episode whose events unfolded over the course of a single day was a trademark of nypd blue and more recently deadwood having an entire season of a new series last 24 hours one per ep the actual running time is 41 minutes the remaining 19 are occupied by commercials when the show airs on telly was the most groundbreaking idea in mainstream television since hill street blues introduced non linear storytelling a mandatory element nowadays and it truly paid off br br ironically enough the original plan for the series was to make it revolve around a wedding fortunately creators joel surnow and robert cochran realized the format was more suitable for a conspiracy thriller which is probably the reason the first glimpse we get of the hero suggests a cheerful atmosphere looking extremely relaxed jack bauer kiefer sutherland is enjoying a game of chess with his daughter kimberly elisha cuthbert and minutes later being tender with teri leslie hope the wife with whom he has just reconciled as in the sopranos though something unexpected and shocking is just behind the corner not only has kim snuck out of her room jack also receives a phone call urging him to get to work immediately at midnight i'm afraid so bauer is a ctu counter terrorist unit agent and his boss has acquired reliable intel about a possible hit on the life of david palmer dennis haysbert an african american presidential candidate who will be in los angeles for the whole day oh right i almost forgot events occur on the day of the california presidential primary no time for napping then jack has to spend the next 24 hours working on the case unfortunately he has a tendency to ignore protocol and that doesn't sit well with george mason xander berkeley a slimy man from division who has been asked to interfere with the operation br br the plot is very dense making the show hard to recommend for those with a short attention span but anyone willing to take a look will be rewarded instantly the writing is sharp and precise the attention to detail unsurpassed and the suspense is consistently sky high mainly thanks to the real time trickery which considerably enhances the adrenaline level br br another great quality of this pilot is the characterization most genre shows sci fi and thriller tend to simply introduce the key players and then define them later on a textbook example is csi where character development is minimal but then again that matches the show's unique style whereas the series debut of 24 offers a rich array of fully rounded people among whom jack sutherland's best role ever and palmer the real revelation of the show stand out for being perfectly described after one episode only the former divided between job and family reckless but humane the latter honorable and endowed with great integrity a couple of supporting parts border on stereotype mason and tony almeida especially but two factors ought to be taken into account a this is the first episode b there's so much going on most viewers won't even complain about a flaw or two after all how many network programs manage to begin with a conspiracy a missing teenager and a huge explosion and still have equally satisfying material for the rest of the season br br tick tock tick tock
this movie is one of my favorites because it makes me think of all the choices i have made and how my life would change if my choices had been different it plays right into the multiple universe theory br br the only thing that doesn't ring true is how larry burrows james belushi has such a hard time understanding what is going on that everything has changed br br
carter wong plays a noble hero on a quest for a book of healing which leads him seeking ultimate vengeance the pacing is good in this film and there are a lot of fight scenes to keep the movie going the flying guillotines look wicked and the main villain has no problems using them although the story isn't strong the action is fun and draws you to the very end which i felt could've had a sequel br br campy and dark this is great ol skool kung fu
the worst movie i have seen in quite a while interesting first half with some engaging terse dialogue among dubious characters in a late night bar the movie then degenerates into a shapeless succession of scenes aiming for visual shock read disgust without any redeeming observations or lessons in humanity or anything else br br i wanted to walk out but the director was present at this showing and my politeness preventing me from showing him disrespect still time is precious as the director himself observed in his intro and i really begrudge the time i wasted on the second half of this one br br saving graces were the three main characters in the first half of the movie especially the female lead
the 100 black and white half hour episodes of the early situation comedy mr peepers were originally broadcast from 1952 55 on nbc like a lot of baby boomers this and ding dong school are my earliest memories of television since both ran later in syndication it is hard to tell how many of these memories are actually tied to the original broadcasts br br mr peepers is worth checking out for more than its nostalgia value it represents a very different style of situation comedy than shows like the honeymooners and i love lucy the genre could have gone in two different directions in those days and ended up taking the loud abrasive path of those two shows which is probably why they still seem contemporary br br mr peepers which was differentiated by its intelligent restrained tone may appear slow and dull in comparison but it's really more a matter of adjusting to the different style once you get into the characters it will win over most intelligent viewers credit should be give to the show's producer fred coe a key figure in early television whose dramatic anthologies are also worth checking out philco television playhouse lights out playhouse 90 producers showcase playwrights 56 fireside theatre etc even on kinescope br br mr peepers offered a much more gentle style with wally cox to be the voice of underdog a few years later in the title role robinson peepers a mild mannered high school science teacher his glasses were his trademark and a symbolic link to his name and role as a passive observer br br the series provided cox with an outstanding supporting cast tony randall played his brash best friend history teacher harvey weskit jack warden played frank whip the loud gym teacher whose mild bullying gave the show most of its conflict elements br br there is some love interest competition involving the school's nurse nancy remington patricia benoit with viewers quickly aligning with mr peepers who seems a much better match for the gentle nancy their on screen marriage near the end 1953 54 season captured national attention an early version of the who shot j r frenzy br br then again what do i know i'm only a child

bruce lee was a great martial artist but this film still is probably one of the worst films ever made it has bruce lee die as the result of falling off a helicopter after being hit by some kind of a ninja knife to the back of the neck but it doesn't explain how he came to be on a helicopter since the prior scene has him near but not on the helicopter which is already 200 feet in the air it just gets downright absurd from then like something out of a cheap comic book maybe the idea isn't so rotten but it isn't done with any degree of artistry from a film making point of view there are dozens of such martial arts bombers out there usually all made in hong kong i think that jean claude van dam improved the genre with adding plausible stories in his films and having film makers who know how to use the camera even steven seagal's films are way better than 90 percent of the martial arts junk movies made during the 1970s and early 1980s in hong kong 'game of death ii' falls into the category of junk cinema in my opinion despite bruce lee being in it
i saw this movie years ago on late night television back then it went by the title of stairway to heaven even as a young boy i remember being deeply moved by the story and astounded by the visual effects of the court trial those who have seen it know what i'm talking about such imagination a perfect blend of romance drama humour and fantasy this movie is right up there with the greatest classics ever made citizen kane casablanca gone with the wind this movie is rated extremely high by imdb voters and rightly so over 51 voters rated it 10 out of 10 over 84 rated it 8 or higher out of 10 i was surprised it was not listed in the top 250 films until i realized so few have seen rated this movie compared to those on the list what a pity i hope this movie gets released on dvd for region 1 north america so that 1 i can purchase it and 2 others discover this hidden treasure
new york i love you is a collective work of eleven short films with each segment running around 10 minutes long the shorts don't exactly relate but they all have something in common love every short is about finding love either if it's about a couple or just two strangers chitchatting the film stars an ensemble cast among them shia labeouf natalie portman hayden christensen orlando bloom chris cooper andy garcia christina ricci irrfan khan robin wright penn julie christie ethan hawke bradley cooper rachel bilson and anton yelchin with such a stellar cast and such an interesting premise i was expecting a tremendous film the problem is new york i love you doesn't add up it remains the sum of its parts some of the segments are funny original and interesting but others are so meaningless orlando bloom christina ricci and ethan hawke maggie q segments that it's appalling the film is definitely uneven and has a very experimental tone story wise it seems like something a few film students could put together having said that the film has some great moments as well one of the best being the segment about an old couple played by eli wallach and cloris leachman walking along in brooklyn on their 67th wedding anniversary and it's moments like this that made me as a viewer wish the film was more consistent because there's a lot of potential here but as unsatisfying as the overall story ends up being for me the cinematography and soundtrack saved the all thing the editing was perfect the way the film was shot was very impressive and the ethereal soundtrack couldn't be more fitting in the end new york i love you feels like an experimental film and as in most experiences there's highs and lows it's how one looks at the film as a whole that will determine if he enjoys it or not it might be worthwhile for some and a waste of time for others br br 7 10
although the actors were good specially fritzi haberland as the blind lilly the film script is obsessively pretentious and completely arbitrary a famous theatre director hilmir snær guðnason becoming blind after a car accident is on the run for himself and his destiny lilly being sightless since her birth is teacher for blind persons and wants to make him seeing again blind persons are seeing with their fingers nose and ears here this movie is becoming a roadmovie and the longer the road becomes the closer their relation develops which was predictable since the beginning of the film the theatre director is on the road to his mother jenny gröllmann his mother is living somewhere in russia on the sea and making artistic installations of course what should she do other and she is still living because she is waiting his son to die my god this are destinies br br finally the son arrived mum is celebrating a big party at the beach wind is blowing and a pianist is playing on a real piano in the middle of a dune yes they are celebrating her farewell the son arrives just in time mother can finally swallow the pills administered by a pretty nurse now a great artist can die in the arms of her great artist son speaking sad contemplations about live in perfect german while the son is answering with a rough accent because the son is unable to see he is not falling in love to the nurse the film script would have become also too complicate but is looking for lilly on the way back to home br br parallel to this roadmovie the sister of lilly staying at home is asking a gawky schoolmate to deflower her who has first to booze himself to courage the occasion is favourable because mum tina engel is on journey together with the lover of lilly paul harald schrott they are after lilly to bring her back paul and the mother of lilly are not falling in love because the film script would have become too complicate the film script missed to make out of paul something exceptional too i would suggest an architect or a pianist or course a famous one when they finally find lilly they want to convince her to come back to paul because he has two eyes to see and is able to care for her but lilly felt in love to his pupil the theatre director did i mention that he was even a famous theatre director br br this is german film art as you may see in this pretentious production that the german film subsidy fund is not always producing good films because they subsidy just such kind of pseudo intellectual films this film is really embarrassing i have the impression that the film script has been cobbled together from some highbrows in coffee shops and restaurants everybody is entitled to contribute with an idea probably also til schweiger has contributed with some intellectual flash of wit being a co producer i was reminded by this film script to an other german film of absolute painfulness barfuss already the spelling of the title is not right barfuss dvd cover writes proudly a til schweiger film this film got also subsidies of filmstiftung nrw filmförderung hamburg and the ffa br br please don't spoil your time with this film there are really good films in germany watch out for film directors like marcus h rosenmüller joseph vilsmaier hans steinbichler hans christian schmid faith akin
bela made 9 pics for monogram but it was only at this one the 4th that things started to come together all the rest in the series would use this one as the essential template for production writing and character development from here on better or worse the series would also deal with one essential theme a scientist usually bela makes experiments in the basement or the old house sometimes in the basement in the old house that causes things to go blooey this was also the first time that art director dave milton got a chance to spread his wings he came on board for black dragons the flick before but this one is where he gets to make his craft start to click lewis made great atmosphere for next to nothing and was around for all the rest of the monograms casting is key in these and it's a pretty good one b movie wise here you get barclay and harlen also from black dragons along with russell who would star in lewtons' cat people movies and rosetto from spooks run wild a nice slice of poverty row talent if you have limited time and budget start with this one it sums up everything they had learned up to this point and gives you something to compare the rest to the plot bela steals gland juice to keep his nasty wife young they both like to sleep in coffins if you can read that and smile the rest will be easy
the subsequent two seasons of this original series was less than lacklustre the latter seasons disastrous reshuffle contributed to its three season short life span maybe if the plug was pulled after the first season it would've gained a cult following br br aside from that the first season was truly hilarious witty clever with superb writing it was promising the first season's excellent brew had the right ingredients characters actors storyline and so forth plus a comedy about a paparazzi reporter was original to boot nora and her fellow photographers on the prowl night after night day after day for the exclusives br br a lot of things don't make sense to me like how this show and another fav of mine gross pointe never made it if only the first seasons of the naked truth and grosse pointe were released on dvd please anyone out there
okay i know i shouldn't like this movie but i do from pat morita's loveable interpretation of a japanese stereotype to jay leno's annoying yell i laughed throughout this movie as long as you take into account that this is not the best movie in the world it's a good mvie br br my favorite part is morita talking to his boss in tokyo with the drinking a close second
caught this movie on the tube on a sunday i thought it was so bad i looked it up on imdb to see what others thought of it i was not surprised at the amount of silly people who enjoyed this fluff i was however surprised when i looked into the comments to read the hated it categories only to find that their were none i was shocked at this i always look at the hated it's as their are always those who hate a movie no matter how good it is somehow this movie made it through unscathed by the haters i say nay to that and proclaim proudly that i hate this movie i know i should go into detail about why i hate this movie but to do so would only grant this movie more respect than it deserves
br br i suppose this is not the best film ever made but i voted it at 10 stars all the same mainly because of my feelings at the end i and all the people around me were simply touched this is something you don't often feel we are all getting a bit cynical and fed up with over sentimentality lazy manipulation or preaching in modern films the story of the film centres around jane a young woman in the last stages of mnd and the friendship that grows between her and richard a man on the verge of a breakdown this could have so easily been a dull and worthy piece but it is so humorous humane and lacking in sentimentality that it wins you over completely and against the odds is a feel good movie br br the acting from branagh and bonham carter is superb especially the latter who is always believable and strong in her role the chemistry between the two also lifts the movie br br the title comes from richards masterpiece a plane made of junk and his old paintings flying here is a symbol for both richards and janes living life to the full so that one can carry on and the other can face the end br br a beautiful and funny movie that i would recommend to anyone don't let the subject matter put you off
as we all know the sub genre of sex comedies is pretty crowded simply being excessively raunchy isn't enough anymore i've seen and heard so many disgusting jokes and actions that a sex comedy really needs to have other positive points to appeal to me these days br br coming into the 40 year old virgin i knew basically what to expect i did see the commercials after all is it true that if you don't use it you lose it what i didn't expect to find is a heart and honest attempts at character development there's still the weird off the wall characters that we see so much in adam sandler movies and there's still enough inappropriate language to sink noah's ark but somehow the movie has a worthwhile love story and yes even a message br br the main character andy is unfortunately for me a person i can relate to in the first shot i see that he even shares my love for mystery science theater 3000 he has a poster for the movie on his wall and throughout the movie we get to see his really neat collection of antiquities andy also has plenty of video games and a working knowledge of films and technology andy doesn't want to buy a car because he prefers his bike most importantly of all andy is a nice person he doesn't swear and he respect women so much that he stays away from them combine all these factors and everybody begins to think he's a serial murderer it's like my life story br br the other characters each have funny little stories to go along with their slightly exaggerated personalities and they all work on a certain level but not the way andy does i felt that it was sort of distracting in a way since andy and his girlfriend trish are really the only truly human characters in the entire movie br br i suppose since i mentioned one flaw i might as well bring the other noticeable one to light the story is clever but too predictable and as far as romances go it's quite simple it deals with andy's relationship with trish for a long time and we all know what's going to happen in the end sure its final detour is a bit different than we may expect but you know what's going to happen in the end and i assure you it does these are definitely small stains on the movie but there's so much good here that i can easily ignore it's few faults br br when i say good i mean bad of course this is a sex comedy and it wants to be bad for the most part i think it succeeded there are so many hilarious scenes such as andy trying to get rid of an erection after refusing to have sex with trish or the scene where andy goes with his trish's daughter to a sexual education class where he ends up asking more questions than anybody else ah and we must not forget the soon to be classic chest waxing sequence ooh como se llama an interesting little note about that scene the actor steve carell actually did wax his belly and the pain shown is real of course they only did one take but it was still a very brave thing to do on his part br br actually since we're talking about steve carell i'd like to say that he has now risen on my list of respected comedians which is sort of odd since i didn't even know who he was prior to seeing this film i was just so impressed by his writing acting and timing that i now really want to keep an eye out for his future roles this man has talent it the 40 year old virgin proves that br br to be honest i had doubts about this film but early word was positive and i knew it was something i was eventually going to see i'm glad that i did too since it's probably one of the funniest movies i've seen in a long time and it doubles as something you feel is worth watching it's not simply a series of sex gags lumped together rather it's a series of sex gags entwined with a very worthwhile character and a truly touching romance now excuse me while i go puke my guts out i can't believe i just wrote that br br my review from frider waves http friderwaves com index php page virgin
i was lucky to see oliver in 1968 on a big cinema screen in boston when i was a young teenager later during the summer of 1969 i was pleased to see this film was still playing at a prominent cinema in leicester square london after it had won the academy award for best picture of the previous year br br th success of oliver on both the stage and screen reminded me that not all talent begins on broadway and ends in hollywood this legendary story by charles dickens which is part of the literary heritage of all english speaking people was admirably brought to the london stage by lionel bart of great britain his charming musical then became a hit in new york and throughout the world the film adaptation was made in england during the summer of 1967 and then released in 1968 the sets and musical numbers are mind boggling the song who will buy required hundreds of actors and the british film director truly deserved his oscar for putting it all together in a seamless manner some canadian and american talent is also part of this wonderful production but mostly it is a tribute to the fine craftsmanship of the british film studios such as shepperton good show other film studios at elstree boreham wood bray denham and ealing have also given the world many films to treasure over the years
for the knowledgeable beatles fan the main value in this movie is to just sit back and pick out the flaws inaccuracies combined events omitted events wildly exaggerated events omitted people timeline errors mis attribute quotes incorrect clothing out of place songs and shame shame incorrect instruments and other boners i just cant think of right now the flaws come fast and furious so you'll have to be on your toes br br i didn't give this a 1 primarily due the fact that it is filmed in liverpool and the actors the band rain give it their all the lennon character is credible and does a good job also the song cry for a shadow is heard at one point and that counts for something br br so watch it for fun but please don't take it as historically accurate
with this movie only running 61 minutes and nothing all that good on television i decided to pop revolt of the zombies into the dvd to pass the time even while realizing the era from which it was coming i was sorely disappointed it started with the oddly upbeat quality of the opening score what no brooding music and then the rather slow moving opening sequences gosh i figured a movie about zombies even from the 1930s would have some chills to it white zombie with bela lugosi certainly did but this had none zero it was scarcely even dramatic except for the few moments with the burning eyes superimposed on the film to indicate the mesmerization of someone like the equally dull king of the zombies this movie may be an interesting curiosity to own but nothing more
in all my 60 years of age i have learned that when we watch a movie there is an identification whether we want it or not implicit with an specific character br br sometimes because the character executes certain gesture sometimes because the character speaks determinate word or sentence  that we use or that we would like to use  in determinate situation br br the movie in question should be seen by this point of view who now find a parking space  in a mall downtown or in the street taken by a car whose driver can't remember to think that he is not the only driver in the world br br who hasn't the urge to rubber out the ill mannered spat br br haven said that i ask did you identify with della played by kim bassinger if your answer is yes then try not to find absurd details  comparatively with life's reality  in the movie because you'll certainly find the movie ridiculous br br abstractions made you will see that the movie has moments of surprise such as 1 in the sequence in which della grabs the box of tools in the trunk does that box contains a gun and does she haves the guts to use it 2 in the sequence in which terry dies whilst falling 3 in the sequence in which della gets attracted by chuckie's mermaid's call br br if you have already seen the movie or if are planning seeing keep in mind that there are realistic movies fiction movies political movies and movies in which you can wash your soul  to exemplify the last one we can quote tropa de elite br br according to newspaper's there was unanimous applause when bope officials take certain attitudes as i have seen the movie in dvd i could not ascertain the audience's reaction  br br as for the direction part susan monford interpretations kim bassinger lukas haas craig scheffer etc edition william m anderson  'dead poets society' 'green card'  exceptional edition 'robocop 2' etc it is well situated in context in a scale of 1 awful to 10 master piece i rate when she was out a 7 regular
new york i love you just like its predecessor paris je t'aime is a compound of various stories that reflects the different kinds and aspects of love but unlike it the rhythm is much faster and the stories much shorter the movie offers a unique view of the city of new york with its various and different landscapes new york i love you offers a first class cast featuring such great actors like shia labeouf natalie portman ian mckellen hayden christensen chistina rcci and orlando bloom ethan hawke james caan and robin wright penn among others and some excellent writers and directors like brett ratner and anthony mingella
i saw this many years after the television series and initially i didn't care for it then as my memory of the series receded with the passage of time i watched again and found it absolutely hilarious based on the stage play by neil simon it has not been 'opened out' much for the big screen and that's one of its strengths walter matthau and jack lemmon are brilliant as oscar and felix and the supporting cast are wonderful particularly john fielder as 'vinnie' even now certain moments can reduce me to tears of laughter felix interrupting oscar in the middle of a ball game with a dinner request oscar cracking up and chasing felix around the apartment the giggling 'pigeon sisters' brought low by felix's sob stories and of course the legendary cafeteria scene later ripped off by nora ephron's 'when harry met sally' razor sharp dialogue too when the boys think felix has taken an overdose oscar says they could be vitamins he could be the healthiest one in the room fantastic
the scenery is pretty and the dog is cute other than that this film has absolutely nothing to recommend it jack warden is pleasantly genial as usual but the script is so awful that even he comes off badly the plot makes no sense the dialogue is dumb and there are numerous smaller faults but the dog is cute
i can't help but laugh at the people who praise this show as heartwarming and tear jerking for one it's entirely unrealistic that these people will have perfect lives after their new homes br br how can these families afford to maintain these new mega houses and what about their poor neighbors property taxes must surely increase after this happens plus the noise would annoy me br br second how excessive can a reality television show become it's practically the same repetitive junk week after week we're introduced to a suffering family they renovate the home then surprise the family and everyone breaks out the kleenex boxes br br not to mention how boring the renovation part is the only interesting part of the show is to see what the house looks like but even that segment is destroyed by the phony confessionals and constant sobbing br br extreme makeover home edition is a show pretending to be heartfelt but it falls flat skip this one if you like reality television survivor is far superior and moving
sure titanic was a good movie the first time you see it but you really should see it a second time and your opinion of the film will definetly change the first time you see the movie you see the underlying love story and think ooh how romantic the second time and i am not the only one to think this it is just annoying and you just sit there watching the movie thinking when is this d n ship going to sink and even this is not as impressive when you see it several times the acting in this film is not bad but definetly not great either was i glad dicaprio did not win an oscar for that film i mean who does he think he is anthony hopkins or denzel washington he does 1 half good movie and won't do a film for less than 20 million and then everyone is suprised that there are hardly any films with him in it but enough about in my eyes the worst character of the film kate winslet's performance on the other hand was wonderful i also tink that the director is very talented to put a film of such a magnitude together there is one lesson to be learned about this movie there are too many love stories as it is filmmakers shouldn't try to add a crummy romance in to every single movie out of a possible 100 i give this film a mere 71
the farrelly brothers bobby and peter are at it again with fever pitch the creators of other films that have dealt with a lot of gross themes abandon that tactic when they decided to bring nick hornby's film to the screen something that it would have been hard to do the novel of the same title dealt with a man's obsession with soccer since it is set in england where that sport consumes most of british sports fans it's to the credit of the writing team of lowell ganz and babaloo mandell to transform the book into a language that would appeal to most americans when they make their hero a boston red sox fan br br fever pitch is a film that presents an obsessive fan ben wrightly whose life revolves into the red sox season and who is an eighth grade teacher with uncanny ways for involving his students into the subject he tries to teach them when ben takes four of his best pupils for a tour of a local firm he meets and falls hopelessly in love with the brainy lindsey meeks a young woman who is going places but at thirty has no life of her own br br the story follows the two lovers through the ritual of attending the red sox at home games in fenway park this team's fans are probably the most loyal people in the world having stuck with a team that does marvelous things but until 2004 never won a world series in fact the ending from what we heard had to be changed because that was the year in which they finally won the event that had eluded them for eighty six years drew barrymore and jimmy fallon are perfect as the couple at the center of the film ms barrymore is a natural who always surprises in her appearances in front of the camera jimmy fallon a popular television comedian turned movie actor has a better opportunity here than in his last appearance in taxi in our humble opinion br br the farrelly brothers film will satisfy their fans as well as baseball fans with this baseball tale
i tried to finish this film three times but it's god awful case in point mom and daughter drive up to the bed and breakfast mom stops for gas crazy gas station weirdos mad at her hubby whose running the b b try to rape her she escapes heads to b b and instead of hubby going ballistic and she wanting to call the cops story just continues with lukewarm behavior on both their parts wow br br other action logic deficits abound acting is also lukewarm and the next door neighbor's warning is delivered in a really corny badly acted moment br br moments of intense gore death unevenly interwoven with lukewarm scenes of time filler interplay between characters br br less focus on gore more focus on mood and story would have been appreciated
the ex mrs bradford 1936 starring thin man series star william powell this film was released the same year as the second thin man film after the thin man comes very close to duplicating the fun and style of the thin man films but it nonetheless misses still it is a wonderfully fun highly entertaining murder mystery in the same comic vein br br is myrna loy missed of course let's not lie however i'd be hard pressed to name a better substitute than jean arthur and the chemistry between arthur and co star william powell is real and it's fun romantic and involving br br the story and screenplay by anthonyu vieller and john wyne's production company partner james edward grant the angel the bad man is close to being up there with a thin man effort but lacks a bit of the proper wit and sizzle br br while it's not in the stratosphere of 'the thin man movies what else is the ex mrs bradford is one of the most entertaining of the dozens and dozens of mystery comedy who done its of the '30s 40s
nora is a single mother of two who still wants to live the life of a young artist in the 1970s as do her friends a group of writers singers and actors the free love' philosophy isn't quite out of the system  and nora didn't count on falling in love particularly with a junkie hazlehurst won her first of two afi awards in the space of four years for her amazing portrayal of nora who makes sure she does the right thing by her children but falls in love with junkie javo friels at the same time garner  who would later costar in films such as love and other catastrophes and strange planet  is well cast as nora's pre pubescent daughter and caton perhaps in readiness for his role as host of the lifestyle program hot property in 2000 appears as a bearded painter early effort by director cameron is a winner he went on to make the award winning miniseries my brother jack among his later projects but it's the stunning delivery by hazlehurst which brings to life the intelligent searching script based on helen garner's award winning novel
i just finished watching guinea pig devils experiment i have to say that this movie although having very good fx better then i expected was not a good movie i honestly cant say that i enjoyed this movie at all of course it is effective in its way of being a shocking realistic twisted 43 minutes of torture but i found it to be very boring and not as gory as i hoped and also i found that the torturers were very annoying when they talked and loughed trying to sound tough all the time that ruined it even more and im sure there's some people out there who will agree with me on that one i have now seen guinea pig 1 2 3 5 and the best one out of those in my opinion is guinea pig 2 flowers of the flesh and blood i wont say much more about devils experiment other than great fx descent acting from the girl annoying fu ing torturers overall i give it 4 stars on account of the fx cos they are awesome
i found darkness to be just too dark it had a kind of cool idea and some ambitious ideas not bad action scenes and a few splashy moments to make you go ugh but it was underlit to the point of confusion you don't really know what is always going on in the dark scenes and for a film that is shot on super 8 film you already have all that nasty grain to deal with as with nathan schiff movies it's just too much director leif jonker seems to want to make an original film but he lacks the know how to do it the camera is never pointed in the right place lack of fundamentals such as how to shoot simple dialogue scenes and how to light a movie hurt as well the actors are all pretty uneven and hammy but despite these negatives the music is good the gore is plenty and ranges from silly putty to really good appliances is this a classic like it says is it worthy of the two discs worth of praise no but it is a good first try now if these guys would stop patting themselves on the back about this movie from what i understand here the only one they have ever finished for a while and try again they may do better
the first 2 parts seek to reduce to absurdity the rise of wasteful wars and rule by nationalist barbarians the 3rd part speculates that progress and exploration toward the moon and beyond is the key to ensuring a meaningful use of human talents and resources it has speeches that some viewers dismiss as naive or bombastic but that make others tingle with excitement it depicts a space gun launcher and a helicopter along with inventive mass communication devices elevators flat screen panels and wireless intercoms it's probably incorrect about windowless buildings in the future but it portrays a child like vision of boundless scientific technological investigation br br to me it seems like a movie about a group of rational minded thinkers guided by a spinozean like morality in their quest to immortalize themselves and live ethically through scientific advancement and a unified world government the pro progress characters such as the two cabals believe humanity could 'live forever' by preserving our experiments and progress for future generations always standing on our humanity as if on the shoulders of giants br br arthur c clarke author of 2001 a space odyssey suggested this film to stanley kubrick as an example of an excellent sf movie kubrick hated it and said he would never watch another movie based on clarke's suggestions source clarke's special millennial introduction to his 2001 novel though the late clarke kept suggesting it at the top of his list whenever someone asked him about the best sf movies it has a beautiful menzies art design but mediocre special effects esp the toy tanks br br i personally loved it and think it excellently captures the zeitgeist of modernity it is a bit naive about the plausibility of creating a society without crime for an extended period of time it also seems implausible about the inevitability of progress it seems to me we could just as easily go right back to the dark ages or at least become so stagnant in science that we kill ourselves off through overpopulation or through our inability to escape the next major natural disaster but it nicely portrays the importance of taking risks against public and nanny outrage for potential threats of space accidents and deaths it challenges us to choose the side of progress over petty desires for safety or comfort or happiness br br cabal too much rest and too soon and we call it death but for man no rest and no ending he must go on conquest beyond conquest this little planet and its winds and ways and all the laws of mind and matter that restrain him then the planets about him and at last out across immensity to the stars and when he has conquered all the deeps of space and all the mysteries of time still he will be beginning br br cabal if we are no more than animals we must snatch at our little scraps of happiness and live and suffer and pass mattering no more than all the other animals do or have done he points out at the stars it is that or this all the universe or nothingness quotes from screenplay br br if this sounds like a rationalization for devoting all of society to progress then the council members of the world government will seem like technocrats but actually those technocrats allow their citizens to become artisans or pursue other passions freely and they would have to be suppressed by government bans laws against science and experiment and other mandates and restrictive uses of power that would turn their critics into tyrants br br in fact a huge group of rebels in the plot feel belittled by all the council's developments of science and technology so they try to put a stop to progress and an end the council's freedom to experiment the progress oriented council will not suppress the free speech of the rebels though only preparing its 'peace gas' in times of emergency and merely wanting the freedom and space to pursue its progress br br so it's also a story about the freedom to do science just as much as it's about the wonders of progress many people in our society would actually agree with some of these basic premises except in cases of social bias many want to ban cloning for example or naturalism some don't want us to progress freely and would rather we just become extinct in due time while enslaved to the earth or fear reason some believe we aren't ready for advanced science technology since we might destroy ourselves but cabal the president of the council has an answer to the problem of danger our scientific revolution did not abolish death or danger it simply made death and danger worth while screenplay
far by my most second favourite cartoon spielberg did after animaniacs even if the ratings were low so what i still enjoyed it and loved it was so funny and i adored the cast wow jess harnell and tress macneille were in there and were just fantastic the whole cast were brilliant especially the legendary frank welker br br i'd love to see this cartoon again was so awesome and the jokes were brilliant also i can remember the hilarious moment where brain cameos in it you hear his voice and it played the patb theme instrumental that was just fantastic i love it in those cartoons when cameos pop in i wish this cartoon and animaniacs came back i loved them
i usually like comedy movies i really enjoy them but i don't really get the point of envy i mean it has a dull content topic and it's not really funny br br although the acting is generally good it's not enough for the movie to get at least a bit interesting stiller and black don't show all their talent in this movie br br so if you're about to rent a comedy i suggest you definitely don't go for this one unless you want to get bored and i can see i'm not the only one with this opinion because even jack black apologized for it take a look at trivia
i was really looking forward too seeing this movie as it has been advertised as a must see movie for people that love movies about nature the movie shows different climates and the animals associated with them by starting at the north pole and going down south as the movie progresses the footage from this movie is often breathtakingly beautiful and i many times wondered how on earth they could have taken some of the shots under water or in the sky however beautiful a large part of the footage i had already seen in the tv series 'planet earth' narrated by david attenborough i found attenborough's narration of planet earth to be much better than the narration of earth 'earth' is an easier movie it skips much of the scientific detail that attenborough covers in his 'planet earth' series for instance earth will tell you that a tropical sea is an ideal nursery for a young humpback whale because there are few predators planet earth will tell you that a tropical sea is a good nursery because the water is low in oxygen and doesn't contain enough nutrients to support very large animals like large sharks etc to me that's an important difference that together with attanborough's far superior voice make planet earth a far better documentary than earth still however i think earth is worth watching for the beautiful footage and the fact that it's easier to understand makes it interesting for children too
aside for being classic in the aspect of its cheesy lines and terrible acting this film should never be watched unless you are looking for a good cure for your insomnia i can't imagine anyone actually thinking this was a good movie
a strong pilot this two hour episode does an excellent job of setting up the characters and background for enterprise the prequel to the original star trek series it stumbles a few times into trek convention and cliché candy colored space strippers never seem to go out of style and i can already foresee snickering references to t'pol as seven of vulcan but the ensemble looks strong the characters are well drawn and one can already see hints that this particular crew will have to be more resourceful in different ways than those of earlier later series scott bakula hits the right note as a captain with kirk's brashness and daring but without his smugness and swagger and i look forward to the ways in which the series will feature the engineer weapons master and communications officer not just a glorified phone operator anymore as supporting players the writers seem to have picked up on the one big mistake made in star trek the next generation deep space 9 and voyager instead of starting with a big ensemble cast and giving characters short shrift it's starting with a smaller core of characters to which a little more variety can be added later which i hope happens because after about a half dozen episodes more variety will be needed
i've had a lot of experience with women in russia and this movie portrays what a lot of them are like unfortunately they are very cunning ruthless and greedy as well as highly unfair from the robotic sex the hustling for gifts to the lies and betrayal i've experienced it all in russia br br i know what i'm talking about and here are my qualifications here are the photojournals of my three trips to russia in search of a bride it includes thousands of pics of many hot russian girls i met black comedy scams i was privy to and the story of my mugging and appearance on russian national tv br br http www happierabroad com photojournals htm br br it's like reality tv you will love it i spent a ton of time putting it together so check it out the russian woman that nicole kidman plays is a lot like the julia and katya in my photojournals br br my 3 bride seeking trips in russia happen to be very exciting and would sell so why don't they make a movie out of my bride seeking adventures in russia however there is one factual impossibility in this film and that is the way which the guy orders his bride from a catalog and having her arrive at an airport it doesn't work that way at all so i don't understand why the media likes to perpetuate this there isn't a single russian bride introduction website that works this way and i challenge anyone to find one that does the fact is you can only order the russian lady's contact info email address phone number etc from the website from there you correspond and then visit her and if you want to bring her to your country you start the immigration process at your ins office and wait months after that that's how it works in real life you can't just order her to arrive at your airport us immigration would never allow such a thing to happen br br wumaster br br i got everything i wanted by going abroad you can too http www happierabroad com
i first remember seeing this one back in the 70s when it was shown on late night television scared the hell out of me but then i was a teenager back in those days not as jaded about films as i am now br br castle of blood aka danse macabre is a fine example of the 60s italian horror genre along with mario bava's black sunday 1960 curse of the living dead aka kill baby kill 1966 and mario caiano's nightmare castle 1965 if you want spooky atmosphere along with great writing then check these out as well i also rate these along with those early poe films that roger corman was doing during the same period br br i saw the new synapse dvd that was taken from a french print and it's a great improvement over that old pan and scan print that was making the rounds on television over the years it adds a couple of minutes of dialog in french that don't really add much to the movie as whole but it's nice to see it complete without cuts unfortunately the dvd doesn't really offer any extras beyond stills from the film br br one flub i noticed was in the opening scene seeing the smoke effects man next to the camera being reflected on the glass of the inn's front door i guess the editors didn't catch it at the time or maybe they didn't care but it is something i didn't notice the first time that's the wonders of dvd you get to see all the flubs mistakes and details that weren't apparent the first time around but no matter br br but no matter it still gets a 7 on the imdb meter br br
spoliers do not read any further if you haven't seen this movie br br picking up after the depressing phantasm ii ended the tall man kidnaps mike while reggie and new kid tim spend most of the rest of the movie trying to get him back and not end up as slaves on the tall man's red planet this one gets really silly the trio of thieves in the bright pink hearse were only there for comic relief and the black karate chick can't remember her name was so irritating i couldn't wait to see if the tall man killed her character this one sets it up to almost look like it was going to be tim's character who comes in late and ultimately is the hero but it doesn't quite work out that way by the very end of this story liz is beheaded by the killer midgets mike gets a silver sphere implanted into his skull the spheres get reggie and the dwarfs get tim and there's no one left to stop the tall man the bad guy wins now how's that for a surprise twist at the end br br this was filmed in 1993 and unreleased until '95 and the ending of this one was at the time final and although it's disappointing and anticlimactic it was also a fitting and appropriate ending for this weird little series but the fourth one changes this ending and adds nothing new but more bad jokes and an even worse and more nonsensical ending br br 1 2 out of
nothing in this film interested me i thought the actors were asleep while they were performing that's not laid back stanislofsky method that's just walking through and saying lines i'm afraid kidman's performance is sad the story is however mildly entertaining if you want to put up with the bad acting
i cannot for the life of me explain what the popularity of the children's television show power rangers is all about br br i never understood why unsuspecting children liked this show in the first place since the characters seem so idiotic and not worth caring about whatsoever br br the costumes look completely atrocious like multi colored spandex that people wear to go to the gym br br what exactly is the purpose of this show anyways but for kids to learn how to fight to solve their problems what is up with the awful hair cuts and clothing on this show anyway not to mention this show is still playing on cable television just to make money to teach kids how to fight each other when they disagree on a certain problem br br there's far better entertainment for today's children hopefully they aren't as gullible as kids of the 1990s who watched this show br br oh and what is up with the homo erotic tension between the red and green rangers anyway
the movie starts with a pair of campers a man and a woman presumably together hiking alone in the vast wilderness sure enough the man hears something and it pangs him so much he goes to investigate it our killer greets him with a stab to the stomach he then chases the girl and slashes her throat the camera during the opening scene is from the point of view as the killer br br we next meet our four main characters two couples one in which is on the rocks the men joke about how the woman would never be able to handle camping alone at a double date sparking the token blonde's ambition to leave a week early unexpectedly the men leave the same day and their car breaks down they end up arriving in the evening when the men arrive they are warned about people disappearing in the forest by a crazy ralph doppleganger they ignore the warning and venture into the blackening night and an eighties song plays in the background with lyrics about being murdered in the dark forest the men get lost br br in the next scene we realize that this isn't just another the burning clone but a ghost story the women scared and lonely are huddling together by the fire two children appear in the shadows and decide to play peeping tom well they are obviously ghosts by the way their voices echo their mother appears with blood dripping from a hole in her forehead and asks the two ladies if they've seen her children before disappearing of course br br the children run home to papa and tell him about the two beautiful ladies by the river this causes quite a stir and he gets up grabbing his knife from atop the fireplace daddy's going hunting the little girl exclaims with bad acting it is apparent here that the dad isn't a ghost like his children br br freaked out by something in the woods the token blonde splits running blindly into the night carrying a knife she encounters the father who explains he's starving and it will be quick this doesn't make sense because of the panther growls we heard earlier maybe he's allergic are panthers honestly even in california she ends up wounding him slightly before getting stabbed in the head a thunderstorm erupts and the men seek shelter which turns out to be where papa resides clearly someone lives here because there's a fire and something weird is roasting over it the children appear and warn them of papa who shows up moments later they disappear as soon as he arrives br br for whatever reason our killer only goes after females he invites the men to have something to eat and tells us the story about his ex wife we are given a flashback of his wife getting caught cheating the old man doesn't tell them however that he kills her and her lover afterwards but daydreams about it we aren't given the reason for the children's demise the men go to sleep and are left unharmed the next morning the men discover the empty campground of their wives after a brief discussion they split up one is to stay at the campsite while the other goes and gets help the one that is going back to his car breaks his leg we are then reunited with the children as they explain to the surviving woman that they are ghosts who killed themselves from being sad about their mother they agree to help the woman reunite with her friends br br the following scene defies the logic of the movie when papa kills the guy waiting at the campsite he was also dating or married to the blonde somehow the children realize he is murdered and tell the woman about it she decides to see it for herself and obviously runs into the killer luckily the children make him stop by threatening to leave him forever you know where this is going br br overall the movie deserves four stars out of ten and that's being generous for all its misgivings the musical score is well done it's still watchable too there are some camera angles that look professional and some of the sets are done well the plot is unbelievable there is such a thing as willing suspension of disbelief but with the toad 6 miles away i can't imagine the token blonde would take off like that in the middle of the night i mean come on br br alan skip bannacheck
i like a lot of the actors actresses involved in this project so being insulted by the movie felt even worse than if they used a unknowns the main problem was this movie was clearly just a concept created to appeal to baby boomers in 20 or 30 years nbc will probably do a movie just like this about the early 90's i can see it now a black family where the kids are involved with the la riot's and the white family has the kids rebel and listen to grunge rock music the soundtrack will feature bands like nirvana n w a public enemy soundgarden etc the movie like this will be just as cheesy as the 60's and i gurantee you nbc will do it see the biggest problem with period pieces when done buy networks is that when you are living in a certain time period you aren't thinking i am living in the 60's or whatever decade is trendy retro at the time next time someone does something like this they should put more weight into there project
this movie is a must see movie for all congress should see this truthful documentary from the point of view of the soldier as should everyone in america the previous reviewer totally missed the point the point is to reveal the truth about teaching our soldiers to kill people who are not terrorists but who just live in our enemy's territory and what it does to the soldiers we must support our troops by bringing them home immediately before another person is killed or injured this also reveals that the government does not help its veterans those who are injured mentally with ptsd post traumatic stress disorder or physically with lost limbs julie a roberts streamwood il
while i recently gave operation petticoat a positive review i really didn't like this film even though it had so many similarities both were made just a few years apart both starred cary grant and both were wwii comedies however the overall tone and style of the films were quite different kiss her for me overall just seemed like a cheaper film with poor writing little energy and some very broad performances even when compared to operation petticoat i think that at least much of the blame for this lies in casting jayne mansfield the combination of her ample talents and limited acting ability really made this a budget film look like it came from a 3rd rate studio plus there wasn't much chemistry or energy in pairing her with cary grant an actor generally loved for his grace and class it's sort of like pairing sir lawrence olivier with marjorie main
this movie really has no beginning or end and it's really very unbelievable mary k and ashley are supposed to be interns working in a mailing room for an italian fashion company but for some reason they're put up in a 5 star hotel conveniently located across the street from the coliseum and all of the other interns they work with are just as abnormally model looking as they are one thing that i found obvious in this movie is the way that one of the twins doesn't end up with the guy i guess they tried to twist their usual plot a bit nice try
a lovely little b picture with all the usual joe lewis touches people ripping up pillows and auras of lurking fear also alas an ending that comes out of nowhere because apparently the auteur has lost interest in the movie or perhaps because as a b picture it has to fit into a slot
elvira cassandra peterson is the host of a cheap horror show after she finds out that her dead aunt has left her some stuff elvira goes to england to pick it up hoping it will be some money but to her horror elvira finds out that all her aunt has left her is her house her dog and a cookbook elvira decides to settle in the house anyways but with her striking dark looks and her stunning features she will not be able to live in peace all the neighbours are now turning the whole town against her and with elvira's outrageous attitude and looks everyone better watch out because elvira is on fire i really enjoyed this movie it's really fun to watch get elvira into all these adventures she's just great the whole movie puts you into a halloween mood sure it's silly and the jokes are cheap but it's a pleasure to watch it i would give elvira mistress of the dark 8 10
masayuki suo who directed this fine film is on a role after the decent fancy dance and the classic in japan anyway college sumo comedy shiko funjatta suo has followed his own huge footsteps with a smashing success br br the story is engaging we both laugh often naoto takenaka is hilarious as he is in suo's two previous films and really root for the characters but to me the big bonus is the look this movie gives the viewer into japanese society real life in japan suo has a knack for showing real life activities with entertaining flair the result is a movie that will pull you in make you laugh make you think and both entertain you and give you insight into today's japan br br also look for the the main 8 actors from shiko funjatta as they all appear again in various roles from supporting characters takenaka to short cameos many
b movie yes diy yes first movie yes but aestheically a this movie definitely had some bad sound editing lighting acting etc etc problems however this movie has many positive things about it first off the most annoying character dies first second its made to be a parody funny b rated horror movie the comments our killer makes to his victims left me and my friends rolling around on the floor laughing br br the problem is a lot of people try to take every independent movie and expect it to be a masterpiece take it for what it is a bunch of kids right out of high school made their first movie for what it is just that it is really good
what was the deal with the clothes they were all dressed like something out of the late 70's early 80s the cars were even were outdated the school was outdated the nuns attire was outdated and the hospital looked like something from the 40's with its wards and wooden staircases and things nothing in the whole movie implied it took place in 1991 my mother was laughing saying geeeee od when was this movie made when we pressed the info button on our remote we were sure 1991 had to be typo did anybody else notice this my favorite part though was when the woman tells her uppity muck husband on the telephone about the inverted cross in the mirror and he just says well look i've got a congress meeting i'll talk to you about it later that line was just classic just like a man my mothers favorite part was when they gave the spawn of the devil child her very own rottweiler my mother said just what the spawn of the devil needs a rottweiler she also enjoyed all of the people collapsing in the churches clutching their chests her other favorite part was the guy at the school parking lot driving 5 miles a hour driving right into the garbage truck dump truck front end loader thingee he had about 20 seconds to just stop the car but he just kept going with a real dumb vacant look on his face i mean how fast can you go in a school parking lot whatever
my take a goofy yet imaginative mess br br keanu reeves yes that keanu reeves and alex winter return as the two punk rock idiots in this sequel to the time trotting adventure comedy bill and ted's excellent adventure now a cult classic in this sequel bill and ted are given much more to do than travel through time they might as well travel heaven and hell too during the beginning of this sequel bill and ted are preparing for a battle of the bands competition which may make them more famous than ever meanwhile many years in a futuristic civilization the time wizard from the first film the always watchable george carlin is running a university praising bill and ted's names there an evil tyrant joss ackland from the hunt for red october plots to get rid of the two idiot rock stars once and for all so he sends two identical android replicas in the words of bill and ted robot us's to do the dirty job br br there after bill and ted experience death and must find their way through hell with inhabitants that happens to include the duo's worst memories and then through heaven in an attempt to get back to earth to save their girlfriends and their show along this whacked out voyage they play board games with none other than death william sadler from die hard 2 reminiscent to a similar moment in the 1957 foreign film classic the seventh seal aid help from a couple of intelligent alien beings and more br br bogus journey's array of exuberant special effects gimmicks aren't up to to date standards and even some of the humor and the for the time look and feel are somewhat dated to be honest the film also feels like it was released on the wrong year even for the 90's but with it's no little lack of imagination and a lively turn by both the performances and direction bill and ted's bogus journey is fun imaginative and yes bogus br br rating 1 2 out of 5
the film is a bit tedious it's mostly a silent film with the bulk o the story provided through a series of voice overs while making a silent film like this is not such a bad idea this is one of those films where the lack of dialog and the repetitive early scenes make it simply tedious you don't understand the reason for the tedium until well into the picture and by then it's too late the first 40 minutes of film is something of a slow piece of mexican soft porn and unimaginative soft porn at that later in the film the style of the first 40 minutes starts to makes sense but it's too late because by then the audience is lost there is some nice location shooting at the national autonomous university of mexico i've often wondered why more films aren't shot there the campus is built on the edge of lava fields that lend the campus a very otherworldly feel my biggest problem with the film is that the director writer has made the film the way he wanted to see it without regard for how a viewer who doesn't know the story will view it you can't ignore the audience when you tell a story
aside from the great movie metropolis this is about the oldest pure sci fi movie while at times the film is a bit preachy and the acting can be a bit broad it is a great film for two reasons first it is extremely original in both style and content even in the 21st century there are no films i can think of that are anything like it second for its time the special effects were absolutely incredible using matte paintings models and huge casts to create amazing scenes of both a post apocalyptic world and a vast city of tomorrow sure you could sit back and knock the film because by today's standards the effects are only so so but you must appreciate that this was state of the art when the film came out in 1936 and it must have really amazed audiences in many ways the sets look highly reminiscent of the modern cities featured at the 1939 world's fair br br i think the movie is also interesting because it seems torn by the question are people really that stupid or are we destined for greatness the end result seems to be a little of both how true br br a final note i saw this twice on tv and just a short time ago on video all three times the sound and print quality stank particularly the sound if this is available on a dvd hopefully it is a lot cleaner and will provide optional captioning as the sound on the video kept cutting out i really would have appreciated this
a documentarist like any filmmaker must convey a compelling story will pascoe fails utterly in this effort cobbling together uninspired snippets of chomsky's wisdom from a visit to mcmaster university in hamilton the footage is shot amateurishly and in video pascoe's only effort at cohering the fragments into a whole is by periodically throwing a vague title on the screen 9 11 activism truth br br lame br br compare this with documentaries like the corporation or the fog of war which create a narrative drawing material from interviews stock footage and filmed footage in the end each delivers a poignant and insightful message deftly and intelligently br br the only saving graces of the film are chomsky's nonchalantly delivered upendings of historical dogma and the fact that the running time is only 74 minutes br br one of the more interesting passages was chomsky's recounting of his experience with national public radio he describes the conservative media as more accommodating to dissenting views while npr's liberal dogma strait jackets its interviewees and dramatically limits its permitted messages yet another media outlet to be skeptical of br br this documentary is for noam chomsky completists only
i watched this movie after watching practical magic and the older film was far superior i liked the way the lighting makeup and costumes changed as gillian changed in the story jimmy stewart's mannerisms didn't do a lot for me in this film but i suppose they did serve to highlight the reserve of gillian's character i was also struck by nicky's and gillian's mannerisms it was as if the director wanted him to appear effeminate and gillian to appear masculine the gestures nicky makes when he's showing redlich his powers especially struck me i've never thought of warlocks as being effeminate so it was an interesting way of contrasting those characters
with all the adult innuendos in todays family movies its nice to see one where you don't have to worry about that and can just sit back and enjoy a family with your kids yes this movie might have a few swear words there's that time where knox swears but they don't let you hear the full words but for the most part this movie is truly as clean as they come and that's including movies from back in the day not only that its very enjoyable one of my favorites and just a great clean and fun movie to watch with the family br br the only thing i have against this movie is that it is too short and i wish there could be more of some of the memorable parts that are in it i'm not going to mention them because i don't want any spoilers here br br all in all nicely done and a great movie to watch so go out and get the kids make some cookies and watch this movie
i think the show had a pretty good concept to work with but the execution was poor the script is poor and acting is bad there were many issues that could have been portrayed in a better way like the protest against gay marriage or finding the graveyard the show can't be properly termed as comedy show as it lacks humor miserably i should say this show was barely successful in putting the life of muslim community to some extent br br till now second season is worse than the first one i had my hopes high regarding this show but i was kind of disappointed still i appreciate cbc for putting up such concept in front of the viewers anyway i wish best of luck for the future
this movie really surprised me i had my doubts about it at first but the movie got better and better for each minute br br it is maybe not for the action seeking audience but for those that like an explicit portrait of a very strange criminal man lover and husband if you're not a fan of bad language or sexual content this really is not for you br br the storyline is somewhat hard to follow sometimes but in the end i think it made everything better the ending was unexpected since you were almost fouled to think it would end otherwise br br as for the acting i think it was good it will not be up for an oscar award for long but it at least caught my eye gil bellows portrait of a prison man is not always perfect but it is very entertaining shaun parkes portrait of bellows prison mate clinique is great and extremely powerful on the downside i think i will put esai morales portrait of markie br br take my advice and watch this movie either you will love it or dislike it
the first film i had to walk out on and it was the cast and crew pre screening not that i was involved i hasten to add i made it through the first hour so i reckon i'm just qualified to comment but that was my limit br br like other comments here how did this get through any kind of qa an accumulation of the very worst in dialogue the epitome of wooden acting awful casting all wrapped together without a plot br br tara fitzgerald's casting was bizarre almost comic she possesses the worst russian accent in movie history br br as i left the screening the director and producers were drinking in a bar outside the cinema they obviously couldn't sit through it again either br br
a lot people get hung up on this films tag as a children's film and that it certainly is though it is one made for adults takashi miike uses the fantasy genre particularly the children's fantasy genre as a springboard into the wild territory that is the great yokai war br br the setup is simple a boy is selected to play the hero in this years annual festival only to discover his role is much more real than he could have imagined what follows is a hallucinatory grotesque whimsical and often funny journey through the world of japanese folklore but wait there's also an evil villain on the lose who wants to destroy the world however the villain here is not a mere demon it is the demon spirit of the accumulated resentment of those things which humans use and discard usuing a chamber made out of pure liquid hate resentment the villain transforms the vibrant colorful yokai spirits into soulless ten foot tall makeshift robots which chainsaw for arms and eyes like burning coals those whove played the video game sonic the hedghog might remember a certain dr robotnik performing similar procedures to the cute and cuddly's who sonic had to then liberate br br the hero in this film is actually the least interesting character essentially playing the straight man in a world gone suddenly mad though he does go through the typical heroes trials he more often than not cowers as do many of the yokia themselves who seem truly defenseless against the murderous robots some spirits being umbrellas with eyes talking walls or creatures whose soul purpose in life is to count beans of course in this magical world of miike's yokai war even beans take a magical power when one believes in them br br in several ways this film subverts the normal conventions of children's fantasy as few if any of the characters are heroic their victory being a combination of happenstance almost arbitrary faith and a desire to party the yokai spirits only rally together and lay siege the villains hideout after they mistake the end of the world invasion of earth for a great yokai festival and even then only to dance and party also the film ends not with the usual celebratory all's well that ends well fantasy ending but with a final scene showing our hero years older with an adult job now unable to see the yokai spirits of his youth who then despondently turn to the villain who being a spirit can never really die this ending with it's yokai spirit who is the spitting image of pokemon's pikachu warns us not just of leaving behind our childhood selves but of the horrors of over consumption the villain is resentment caused when humans no longer have reverence for the world and the objects around them in japanese folklore nearly every object has some kind of spirit and so when they are used and discarded as we in consumer societies do without reverence they become soulless vengeful machines not unlike those seen in modern video games suggesting that though our imaginations and myths do not ever really die but can become deformed br br this is one of the first scripts miike has contributed to and i believe it shows as there's a tightness conceptually that sometimes gets swept under the rug by his exuberance for visual playfulness though i've focused mostly on the story since lots of users here seem to write it off i do want to say that visually it's a kaleidescope of cgi stop animation costume and live puppetry that works remarkably well there's a dreamlike quality to a lot of the film and the miyazaki comparisons are warranted as are the neverending story and labrynth comparisons though this film is sharper and more adult than either the yokai are beaten brutalized and turned into machines of living hate who i believe even kill a few humans a deformed aborted calf with a mans face is born and dies in the films grotesque opening while a sexual undercurrent the women with the long neck licking the face of our boy hero or another characters persistent memory of touching the thigh of a young scantily clad water spirit as a boy seem to linger a bit too long for most western tastes especially when considering this is a children's film however these are slight enough to catch adult attentions while minor enough not to traumatize any children to bad grims fairy tales before revisions did much worse far more often br br all and all this is one of miikes most accessible and engaging ventures yet with enough visual drama and great performances the yokai spirits have a humanism and an absurd humor to them thats laugh out loud funny at times to appeal to audiences of all ages and a steady conceptual undercurrent strong enough to draw in an adult audience who have presumably brought their children or else come out of a sense of nostalgia for the long lost fantasy films of their youth the latter group the film seems to address the most fervently asking that they not just continue passive consumption of the world around them but show reverence to those spirits within them which seemed so much closer to reality in childhood another beautiful funny and truly original film from a thrilling director who hasn't come close to his apex instant classic
russian emigrant director in hollywood in 1928 william powell is casting his epic about the russian revolution and hires an old ex general from the czarist regime emil jannings to play the general of the film and the two relive the drama and the memory of the woman they shared evelyn brent of 11 years before br br try as i might i feel it hard to warm to 'the last command' for all its virtues 'the docks of new york' was indubitably a great film and 'underworld' is a film i have always been craving to see but 'the last command' is rather heavy going the premise is fascinating but the treatment does really make the script come to life except in the sequences set in hollywood depicting the breadline of employable extras and the machinations of a big movie production with state of the art technology br br emil jannings is predictably a marvelous russian general distinguishing wonderfully between the traumatized and decrepit old ex general transfixed in his misery and the vigorous hearty officer of yore br br the ending is great and worth the wait but in order to get there you must prepared to be slightly bored at times
i saw this piece of garbage on amc last night and wonder how it could be considered in any way an american movie classic it was awful in every way how badly did jack lemmon james stewart and the rest of the cast need cash that they would even consider doing this movie
i thought the original of this film was quaint and charming as well as having me sitting on the edge of my seat trying to figure it out br br since i had already seen the original when i saw this on sci fi channel i don't know if this remake was deliberately made for sci fi i knew what it was within the first few minutes since i like richard burgi as a character actor i wanted to see how he would pull it off br br the writers producers etc modernized the film a bit by trying to explain the plight of the aliens they could no longer reproduce their own kind and needed help using the same pseudo science that has been crammed in our ears in the 90's maybe it added a bit of polish to the film or not br br this film film this production takes on a more sinister edge than the original did the original ended with a confrontation between the young woman and the alien and an understanding of sorts took place although no resolution of the alien's problem br br i sort of remember that in this remake the woman became rather hostile towards the burgi alien i think it could have ended better but the ending is just the ending and the yarn is a swell yarn being of the basic 1958 science fiction pulp stock many great science fiction stories were written in the 50's and some of them even made it to film br br this is a swell thing to watch on like a rainy day or something i rate it highly cos of all the remakes of old 50's sci fi this one came off well i actually enjoyed this quite a bit br br but if anyone really wants to see this story told well i suggest the original 1958 version with tom tyron and gloria talbott directed by gene fowler jr
if you lived through the 60s this film can be at times painful and other times quite joyous it's all there but the small print in the counter culture tabloids prevalent at the time these are the roots of a social revolution that is still playing out don't speak too soon for the wheel's still in spin for the times they are a changin' while the film focuses on the revolutionary nature of lsd and it's dissemination at the time that alone played a tremendous hand in the evolution of the intelligentsia influencing engineers scientists and aiding in the hyper development of computer related activities a salute to the filmmakers from one who was there you've captured the era better than i've seen before
i'll keep this one quite short i believe that this is an extraordinary movie i see other reviewers who have commented to the effect that it's badly written poorly shot has a terrible soundtrack and worse that it's not real in its portrayal of life ok so it may not be quite believable for its whole length but this movie carries a message of hope which some others seemed to have missed hope that it isn't too late to save people from the terrible things that go on in so many lives gangland violence is real right is it right no this movie carries an important social message which the cynics may dislike but which nonetheless is to be praised rather than denigrated i have watched this movie with great enjoyment at least eight times each time with equal enjoyment and each time with the feeling that maybe the world could be made better and is not beyond saving well not until 2008 anyway 9 out of 10 from me for this one it's very nearly perfect in my view jmv
a warning to potential viewers if you are looking for an adaptation of the classic story the most dangerous game look elsewhere seven women for satan br br only superficially addresses the original work by using the name of zaroff and having said character murder people br br some of what follows might be considered by some to be spoilers or not br br boris zaroff is played by writer director michel lemoine whereas his ancestor hunted men because they were the only prey that were truly challenging boris' victims are usually in a position where they cannot defend themselves the film rambles from scene to scene with a near total lack of clarity the director seems to have totally disregarded pacing and left the viewer with a suffocatingly dull film a few individual scenes are mildly interesting such as a torture rack sequence but as a unit the film fails to entertain viewers who are more br br interested in an assortment of attractive and semi attractive actresses in various stages of undress might find the film watchable most will probably find their time is better spent watching mentos commercials br br in a side note the dvd extras included a fair amount of information on the film's history apparently it was banned for several years in its native france which pretty much ruined any chance it had for widespread distribution
an entertaining kung fu film with acting plot and fight scenes a cut above the average chop socky all of the cast are likeable characters and skilled martial artists alexander fu sheng's proto jackie chan comedy antics are fun to watch and his austere companion shows particularly impressive skills for me the film's only glaring flaw is the size of the cast at times things get a little confused as the film chops and changes between various subplots and some of the characters are not as fully fleshed out as one might wish br br but a kung fu film should be judged first and foremost on the quality of the action and shaolin temple definitely delivers on that count the film climaxes with a high bodycount battle that allows each character to show off his skills against a worthy opponent br br overall shaolin temple is an enjoyable low budget kung fu movie not up to the quality of a good jet li film but definitely worth a look for fans of the genre my rating 8 10 br br misc notes the 1987 warner home video release i saw was predictably poorly dubbed and lacked full cast crew credits
i'm a big fan of nicolas cage and i never thought he would work on a movie like this i couldn't believe the other reviews and i thought it shouldn't be bad to watch it at least once but trust me it is br br i haven't seen the old movie but why would they want to remake a movie like this the very basic idea of a good horror movie is either it should have an extremely intelligent script or it should be extremely graphic this film doesn't fall under any of those and just remains dumb i just kept watching the movie hoping it would get interesting at some point but it never does br br so this movie is a big no no for both horror movie fans as well as for the cage fans you could probably for it show up on television
i'm working my way through the horror classics 50 movie pack collection and revolt of the zombies is one of the movies in the set i am watching them with my soon to be seven year old daughter which makes most of these movies a laugh riot br br i had high hopes for revolt of the zombies after watching white zombie which is really the precursor to so much that is the mainstay of zombies in cinema think clive barker's serpent and the rainbow and james bond's live and let die funeral scene not night of the living dead br br however even though the title includes the word zombies it is little more than a love triangle involving anthropologist armand louque who is smitten with claire duval who in turn is taken with his companion clifford grayson what a yawn fest my daughter fell asleep half way through br br i had a real hard time deciphering who these people worked for the allies or the axis but i guess that doesn't really matter br br i was shocked to see bela lugosi in the credits for this movie but of course those were his eyes from white zombie serving as the mind control device for the zombies
ok as everyone has pointed out this film is a complete dog to some degree this is because it was a gory sexploitation film that had a lot of material excised or darkened down to near invisibility to escape the censor's x rating but the film has many other flaws as well br br to begin with the scriptwriter seems to have got his werewolves and vampires mixed up the baddies in this film are furry and don't like silver but in every other respect they behave like vampires now you just can't do that with a crappy genre flick you've got to stick to the rules of the genre or the fans get all confused and annoyed by suspending disbelief in the wrong thing in fact the whole confusing and poorly presented plot is something that has already been done for vampires but doesn't make any sense in a werewolf movie br br secondly the werewolf costumes are the lamest you have ever seen anybody in the werewolf movie business ought to know that the werewolf costumes and transformations are something the fans assess critically yet some of these werewolves are just plain goofy br br there are a couple of slightly good bits i actually quite liked the score others have mentioned sybil danning's tits and br br spoiler if such a thing can exist br br i also quite liked the plan for attacking the werewolves' stronghold there are so many horror movies that rely on characters behaving stupidly but in this case they first acquire a very sensible and effective anti werewolf arsenal and go slaughter the monsters i mean you can kill werewolves with silver bullets and we have some pretty powerful firearms these days shouldn't be too hard to put two and two together hmm but in typical style this movie goes over the top and adds some other very zany and amusing anti lycanthrope weapons
i'm a writer working at home and diagnosis murder is my lunchtime break companion good clean fun good humour and nostalgia for the days of the dick van dyke show how innocent we all were and how innocent is diagnosis murder i particularly enjoyed the episodes with other nostalgia figures like joe mannix the bad guys always get caught the good guys carry on the stars clearly enjoy themselves and are having a ball without taking themselves too seriously br br one beef why were so many of the villains women or at least bitches amanda was too dizzy its hard to imagine her really carrying out anything as gruesome as an autopsy br br i hope we haven't seen the last of dick van dyke and family on our screens esp at lunchtimes
this would've been a great silent film the acting really is good at least in a look ma i'm doing really big acting sort of way br br everything is huge every line is profound every scene is shattered by human tragedy br br mostly i felt like gagging yet like any train wreck i couldn't tear my eyes away this dialogue might've worked on the stage although i doubt it on the screen it was cluttered haphazard hackneyed and pretty much every other stereotypical negative adjective you can come up with to describe a really bad dramatic work br br if you enjoy your melodrama in huge heaping doses you might enjoy the movie be prepared to wait however for all that melodrama this thing sure plods along at its own pace br br this script must've sounded a lot different when the actors involved were reading it to themselves it simply doesn't work once they get around to delivering it in front of the camera br br imdb does us a great disservice at times when it uses its goofy computer controlled weighted score curse of the starving class deserves less than a 1 br br character driven fiction is great but when you develop your characters by simply pushing them through hoops with no plausible explanation for their maturation or evolution it isn't character development your characters must have a motivation being drunk for a while and waking up in a field is not character development that's a plot contrivance br br stay away from this movie or at the very least watch it muted perhaps you'll get some amusement from all the arm waving the characters do br br oh and word to the wise to prove that this is truly an artsy film you see james woods in all his dangly male look at me i'm the figurative and literal representation of the naked vulnerability of man glory br br don't say you weren't warned
sweet and charming funny and poignant plot less but meaningful before sunrise 1995 the third movie of richard linklater is dedicated to everyone who ever been in love is in love or never been in love but still dreams of it and hopes to find it it is one of the very rare movies that is should will be equally interesting to teenagers their parents and even grandparents it seems a very simple little movie with no spectacular visual effects car chases or long and steamy sex scenes two young people in their early 20s two college students american tourist ethan hawke who is returning home after the summer in europe and the french student julie delpy who goes to paris to attend the classes in sorbonne meet on a train they are attracted to each other instantly even before they start talking they hop off the train in vienna where they walk around exploring the city all night they talk and fall in love that's it that's the movie it could've been boring and silly but instead it is a lovely believable clever and moving romance that only gets better with each viewing at least for this viewer high praise and my sincere gratitude go to the director and writers for delivering two charming characters superb writing always interesting and witty dialogs two awesome performances and the atmosphere of magic that falling in love is julie delpy who looks like a botticelli's angel is great in portraying smart independent and incredibly attractive young woman
96 minutes of this is cruel and i love the old munster's yes the plot is thing yes the lines are trite but whoever was at the helm of this was not a fan there is so much 'intrigue' and i use that word with great pause that i wonder if it's an old starsky hutch episode i lost count of the number of times i noticed that makeup had missed a spot near the collar refusing to acknowledge that any time had passed since the mid 60's ludicrous the producers simply replace marilyn eddie with younger actors why not let them grow and age the addition of an addam's family style reunion does not add to the flavor of the halloween party br br grandpa herman fly to transylvania and back in a few hours preposterous sid ceaser is the most yes the most unbelievable character i am including the bad robots since he babbles an unwild combination of gibberish yiddish but claims to be an ancient arabic ruler and yes it looks like the laugh track is missing in fact there are several spots where there is dead air as if the laugh track was to be inserted later the actors seem to wait on the faux audience it's not laughable it's sad oh and the best part yvonne decarlo has a line that just goes to show you how out of touch the writers and producers were marilyn says something like where could uncle herman and grandpa be they could have been in an accident they could have been hit by a car or a train lily says responds with something like you're uncle herman will be here if he has to drag himself off the train track what's amazing about this is yvonne decarlo's husband was a stuntman in the early 60's and lost a leg and was nearly killed in a train stunt he never recovered and this financially devastated her family check out biography's fantastic review of her life and career this line could have been easily changed to be more sensitive to her br br if you are a real fan of the munster's then you'll have to rent this mess it illustrates how some things are better left alone even with the nearly original cast this is almost as bad as the attempted remake of the show a few years ago
i saw this movie the first seconds the voice of t r took me on to the journey well i disliked the big glued thumbs in the beginning but the absurd humor it and the gordious looks of both sissy actors i do not know who played the young her but she was great and so was uma br br the two other people who where in the cinema went out after about half an hour i was with a friend and it is always a test to watch a movie i like good with one of my friends and we both enjoyed it too the maximum hilarious laughs sadness about the realistic police normalos both of us fans of t robbins books i found it well done thought that robbins would also approve though i do not have an idea if he likes the film or not br br i would love to see the cut out stuff i heard that gus v sand had to take out lots of scenes because of the first time viewers or the producers well still it is an artistic movie much too short though it is one of my all time favorites and i am aware of it that the majority of people can't stand that kind of movie and assume that people who enjoy that films are whatever they think what a pity hopefully there will come the day that there will be a dvd with the full material hoping to see more of crispian keanu expecting to see her baby and all br br if you have the chance to see it think twice and enjoy it if you made the choice to watch m
i can appreciate what barney is trying to achieve but after sitting through this last night at a college movie house i couldn't help but think when is this gonna end a very long and ponderous two hours and fifteen minutes i had only seen a part of cremaster 3 on dvd and thought i knew what to expect that said experimental films such as this are better digested in small increments there are a couple of beautiful horrible images including the title sequence no kidding but if you go into this expecting any kind of plot or meaning then you are in for a long snooze inducing ride i managed to stay awake for the whole thing if that's a compliment but more often than not i was waiting for some kind of meaning or narrative big mistake among the collection of images are a very ornate gift wrapping ceremony the creation of a disgusting dish of what appears to be petroleum jelly slabs formed with a cookie cutter and sprinkled with shrimp this is served to the crew of the ship which is shown throughout the film a large blubber cheesecake with a large tentacle turd placed in the center of it and the mutual evisceration of bjork and director matthew barney which eventually culminates in some bizarre kind of communion followed by their transformation into whale like creatures the soundtrack is at times beautiful and annoying sometimes even maddening at one time there is a song being sung by bjork to go along with the ephemeral rituals being played before us and at other times there is just a constant droning of a high pitched instrument which we see a mysterious woman playing at the beginning and end of the movie if this sounds like it doesn't make sense that is because is doesn't if this sounds like your cup of tea then you will absolutely love it if this sounds like something that you probably won't like then stay far away from it because you will most likely walk out of the theater during the halfway mark like several people at the screening i attended this is the very definition of an art film you get from it what you take from it but otherwise there really isn't much there other than a few oddities and constant construction and deconstruction rituals i'm glad that there is a place for films such as this but i can't say i would want to sit through it again however i can't say i wouldn't want to see one of barney cremaster films from start to finish and compare it with this i think perhaps now that i know what to expect i might enjoy something like this more to give you an idea of what kind of comprehension factor this film has i probably would've liked it better if i had gotten stoned then again it could've felt twice as long as it was and then it would've really gotten ponderous definitely not for everyone
i really like this movie bozz is an ultra cool not to be intimidated soldier who does not want to go to war his persona is similar in a way to yossarian in catch 22 joseph heller's classic novel about men and war this film however is not set in a war zone but in a pre war combat prep training this wonderful film is all about the sickening realization that the vietnam war was a mistake and those men who were pegged to be sacrificed for a losing cause br br colin farrell is brilliant as bozz a soldier who showed as much genuine love and compassion for his fellow soldier as he did disdain and irreverence for the establishment that was trying to kill him bozz is totally cool and non plussed testing and tweaking his military superiors getting their goat at every opportunity he is a jesus christ figure with a psychology degree saving his fellow soldiers and showing the ones in genuine need the way out of this man's army br br the acting and action is crisp and believable and as a sleeper tigerland goes down with apocalypse now and full metal jacket as one of the top three vietnam films in my opinion br br five stars a top pick
this is by all categories the best movie i have ever seen forget hollywood their movies always sucked this is art moon child's story starts with kei a japanese vampire who loathes what he has become and lives in denial his wish for final death leads him to mallepa where refugees from several asian countries live here he meets sho an orphan living on the street br br from here the movie is an intense experience which bases on the visual and emotional part of the movie it has everything you laugh you cry you get angry excited sad happy never has a movie touched me the way this movie do and the actors are amazing never have i heard anyone speak so many languages without it sounding strange a big praise to the editor for creating this masterpiece br br a last comment on this brilliant movie is that it stars gackt ex vocalist of malice mizer and hyde vocalist of l'arc en ciel in excellent roles as sho and kei i am amazed at how gackt can change his way of speaking and acting depending on what age he is acting out br br this is a must see if you never see any films see moon child the crow brandon lee and the newly released masterpiece final fantasy vii advent children all in their original languages of course
it even beats the nasty raw almost twenty years old is this show and still i laughed very much when i was watching it last night it shows eddie murphy dressed in tight red clothes old school and he jokes with everything from celebertis to his family he was only 22 years old then and this is a must see br br 8 10
this is one of the greatest sports movies ever made by hollywood what a wonderful story about one of the great sports figures of american history what makes the story of james j corbett especially interesting is that mr corbett introduced the style of boxing that continues to this day in that respect james j corbett was truly innovated but getting back to the movie all the performances were excellent alexis smith was beautiful indeed she looked like nicole kidman and although it's a period piece the story withstands the test of time it has not gone stale ward bond's portrayal of john l sullivan has to be one of the great portrayals of an actual sports figure in the history of movies and the boxing scenes are realistic well staged and highly effective that coupled with a great script makes this movie a must
although i am inclined to agree with the other comments made by people who have seen this movie i am ashamed to say i rather like it not often can such a huge pile of 80s pap be found outside of a wham video so it is most definitely worth a viewing £0 79 a night in my local store watch out for the insanely obvious seams and zip on the monster's costume the fact that the 'hero' looks a lot like keith chegwin and such classic lines as the following evil wizard type bloke at last we meet kor kor thrilling isn't it br br amazing i also like the fact that although the video box looks quite exciting with images of a castle surrounded by raging seas and a dangerous falcon like bird carrying a handsome hero to safety among other such 'interesting and engaging' suggestions of what goes on in the actual film none of them actually happen no i'm not joking there really isn't a raging sea or a ferocious bird it's just trying to make you interested classic in my opinion this film gets 10 for pure entertainment value
i cannot say enough bad things about this train wreck it is one of the few movies i've ever been tempted to walk out of it was a bad premise to begin with first pregnant male but then they tried to make it a spoof what were they spoofing all those real pregnant males this was the worst movie i have ever seen if it had enough votes it would be on the imdb bottom 100 if it was possible to give it a zero i would and i would still feel i had given it too much credit
william shatner in small doses is tolerable unfortunately instead of leaving his character as a minor irritation and in that moderately amusing it has been seen fit to enlarge his role and overdo it just as occurred in the original star trek series i guess i will never understand american humour which frequently goes 'over the top' to get the message through i vote with my feet i no longer watch the show which is a shame because the rest of the cast were good it is pity that shatner's overdone role also affects james spader's performance but the majority demonstrate the way society is going i guess i don't travel the same routes frank
the first question that springs to mind after watching this rubbish is who on earth gave these idiots the right to use the omen name on this movie it is a shambolic embarrassing pathetic atempt to carry on the omen franchise when the film starts the backing music sounds like it has been lifted straight from a bugs bunny cartoon and from then on the film gets worse i dont know who wrote the script but i bet they got a e for it when they took it back to show their teacher it is difficult after a while to tell if this is a comedy because what happens is so funny and so un true to the original omen it beggers belief the acting is laughable especially from the leading lady faye grant she keeps pulling silly faces or is she finding it difficult not to laugh it's hard to tell the worst sequal i have ever had the misfortune to witness 1 out of 10
after having seen marrying mafia i'd nearly lost my faith in korean movie business but this one brought my faith back br br leading female character who is university student forced to teach the spoiled rich but charistmatic high school student guy he is actually female character's age through some hilarious quarrells these two end up being great friends br br i was pleasantly surprised that newcomer kwan sang woo did his job with excellency he was such a revelation actress kim ha nul was also charming as usual br br this movie tried hard to avoid any cliches that can be seen in typical romantic comedies and it didn't show us any unnecessary nude sex scenes it was brilliant lovely fresh made me want to see it again br br
whether this movie is propaganda or not i firmly believe it is not it really shows the power of media the importance of this documentary is not to show how good of a man chavez is it is really to demonstrate the way the bolivarians saw how it happened the chavez way of seeing it although it may seem wrong and bias to support a film i think the point of view shown in the movie is utterly legitimate the venezuelian people via the private media corporation of venezuela only saw a one side perspective of the coup the neo liberal side this movie shows us the way the bolivarians saw it call it propaganda i say it's a judgment call on your part

takashi miike is one of my favorite directors and i was worried about him doing a kids film because i would hate to see him depart from his films i came to love visitor q gozu izo ichi the killer and black socioty trilogy lately he seems to be exploring new territory and i think he's succeeding still this was the first of his films i'd seen him take that direction so i was nervous of coarse i bought it without seeing it and was glad i did br br great yokai war is a perfect kids film and adults should like it too the whole film reminded me so much of the movies i loved as a child neverending story labyrinth return to oz etc i enjoyed those films because they didn't treat kids like they're stupid and this one doesn't either the dark underlying morals are there but it's also as silly as any kids film should be i personally wasn't bothered by the cgi and prosthetics i feel like they fit well and don't think kids will notice br br if you are a die hard takashi miike fan you may not like this one but i suggest giving it a shot it proves that miike is as diverse and talented as i suspected he is he also continues to make his signature miike films outside of these ones which is very reassuring br br to those people that are new to takashi miike and want something light hearted or dramatic like this one i suggest these other miike films 'zebraman' 'the happiness of the katakuris' 'sabu' and 'the bird people in china ' br br good job takashi miike 8 10 stars
when i watched this film the first time it was a taped copy and the title was is caged terror i still own the tape and i confess i've watched it more than once from beginning to end the film is extremely low budget and the dialogue is often unintentionally amusing i have gotten a few of my friends to watch this and we've had some great laughs from the terrible script the film concerns a couple remember this is like early 70's so they are just too hip man who go on a week end camping trip in what i believe was supposed to be upstate ny they have some hilarious dialogue after catching and eating a fish and the girl bemoans the death of the fish and that they ate it the guy comes back with something goofy about how they ate the fish and now it was a part of them and he goes and that's beautiful man heavy man really heavy lol anyway along come a couple of vietnam vets one of who plays the flute i believe at any rate they are musical fellows the guys are clearly attracted to the girl and when the couple prove unfriendly they end up terrorizing them during the night the guy ends up caged in a chicken coop and has to watch his girl friend being ravished by the two guys actually by the end of the night she seems to be pretty into it and when morning comes the guys leave and the girl and guy are free to leave supposedly the guy has learned a lesson about how to treat people and the girl has a smile on her face anyway i would recommend this film highly to anyone looking for a damn good laugh it never fails to amuse me anyway if i could find this on dvd and replace my old tape copy i'd actually buy it again it's classic camp you gotta love this stuff
this is a strange sex comedy because there s very little comedy but a whole lot of sex most of which takes place in the back of a car and is so graphic it makes basic instinct look like an edition of teletubbies i kid you not the sex in this film is so in your face it might just choke you especially if you re watching with your grandparents br br as for the rest of rita sue and bob too there s not much else worth mentioning except the language where every single sentence seems to contain the f word this a rather bleak hyper realist british film made at a time when channel 4 was the main investor in british movies which explains its made for television low budget feel
where is it written that sequels must suck scream 2 didn't others didn't but this one sure did problems include horrible actors only christopher walken could act in the entire film bad writing you will never understand what's going on and i even have done research on the idea of nephilim before and just horrible choices for casting eric roberts makes the stupidest archangel michael that i have ever seen in my life br br avoid it like the plague unless you are desperate to see christopher walken in that case just fast forward to the parts where he is in the film and avoid the others br br yech
the interplay between the characters is a moral disaster you end up disliking most of the characters and you don't particularly like any of them br br even the two main characters played by david and gwen are so badly written that you really don't care one bit about them the movie has no plot no direction and no purpose the single redeeming quality of the movie was to treat it as a glimpse into the messed up lives of a few losers and that's hardly stimulating even as an afternoon waste
i love this movie i mean the story may not be the best but the dancing most certainly makes up for it you get to know a little bit about each character the way they want you to learn about them i just think that you won't like this movie unless you're into broadway
an underrated addition to the graham greene cinematic canon its perceived faults can now be seen as virtues director shumlin theatrical director frames his action with an oppressive rigidity appropriate to the material and the seemingly inept compositions compellingly suggest unease both a dark thriller and a story of moral regeneration for the female character in a 40s thriller the film has an upright hero who turns mad and murderous and possibly paedophiliac brilliantly brings the faraway ideologies of the spanish civil war into jolting dangerous reality has one horrific murder an astonishing insights into class and capitalism clever theatrical metaphors a rare approximation of greene's god and an ending that is only happy if you know nothing about history
it is rare that one comes across a movie as flawless as this it's truly one of the best acted most tightly structured films i've ever seen every line of dialogue can be interpreted in several ways relating to each of the three main characters differently the film weaves an intrinsic web of motivations and double crosses that snare you and refuse to let go add to this that the slow burning romance between kevin and faye is as moving as anything that's ever been committed to celluloid and you have the ingredients for a perfect film it exposes the romance of movies such as titanic as the trite cliches they are if you're looking for a movie to watch while you fold laundry this isn't it you have to commit yourself to this film you can't have a conversation while running in and out of the room this movie demands your attention treat it with the respect you deserve and you'll get a lot out of it unless you think titanic is the greatest film ever
i found it a real task to sit through this film the sound track was not the best and some of the accents made it difficult to understand what was being said there was little to move the plot along and often the action simply stopped and there was a prolonged period of conversations which seemed extraneous to the movie these conversations switched between family groups and the observer was left to try and piece together what the common thread was that tied them together it is rare that i rate a film this low and do so in this case as the entire viewing experience left me thinking so what and why did i waste my time watching this
okay first of i hate commenting on this thing but i felt like i had to stand up for this movie so many people were bashing on it and i felt like people who might want to see it should get a second opinion br br first off bend it like beckham is not meant to be the most profound movie of the century if that's what you're looking for go somewhere else just because it is an independent film does not mean it has to be artsy it's supposed to make you feel good and you're supposed to have fun watching it and those two things are handily accomplished br br secondly the acting though not halle berry in monster's ball is still good the movie doesn't need acting like that honestly so don't look for it it's a family movie if that's what you wanted you wouldn't or shouldn't even be looking into this movie honestly br br lastly it has a really cute story i think it's thought out well and it's entertaining to watch it's also very true to life for the most part for that culture so if you want to sit down and watch a movie that you can enjoy and feel good about when you're finished if you're looking for something with deep thought out plot lines and big dramatic scenes this is not for you br br lyndsay
seems that the cast should ensure at least an average movie and so i sat down for 102 minutes of unbelief beside ed harris no one seems to own the skills of acting even sean connery who i normally worship must have had an off day during the entire filming of just case not once in during the whole movie one actor could convince me br br this made this movie look cheap and unreal br br the story makes up a little it is thrilling and the plot is unexpected br br conclusion only watch this movie if you really have nothing more useful to do
i used to write comments at imdb but i don't do so anymore it happens that imdb has become massive and consequently subjectiveness has ruined scores what do i mean that anyone that is not particularly fond of movies and doesn't have any expertise on the subject watches some crap or the opposite and in case he likes it delivers a 10 and if he doesn't he goes for a 1 this of course cannot measure anything correctly now for the film i truly regret ever having delivered any 10s to some very few films because then i must score this one with 12 or 13 which is not possible this documentary has something that i don't expect to watch ever again in my whole life in any other film it is simply mesmerizing and it's not just a way of saying it really is the last 25 minutes have a load of energy visual rejoice and wisdom the words spoken by the starring guys that really there's no possible match i don't keep movies rarely would i find any sense in doing so but this one is the kind of film you should buy and keep and watch from time to time maybe 10 or 20 times as years go by i got nothing more to say this is a genuine objective 10 for me
this is one of disney's top five animated features in my opinion cinderella was a perfect return to the full length feature animation film as opposed to the compilation films of the 40's and expensive depth via the multi plane camera returns to the film in no other way although disney adapts the story somewhat liberally you gather the idea of the era via the dress and set stylizations a clear time period the story takes place br br cinderella is more mature than snow white and a multi dimensional character actually all of the characters are somewhat well developed except for the prince left the most flat we know he has a sense of humor and a great smile but that's about all like snow white disney has some permanent impact on the story in popular culture in most versions of cinderella the stepsisters are attractive just not as pretty as cinderella and their character takes away from their otherwise nice appearance br br favorite disney additions the mice also appreciated the continuity cinderella always loses her shoe throughout the film the addition of the homemade gown as well as the following assault from the stepsisters was always horrific as a child i remember view master showing this with a black background and a large red light on it the broken slipper shows the unwillingness of evil lady tremaine to give up her hold over cinderella and admit defeat audley would go on to characterize the most wicked of all disney villains satanic witch maleficent in sleeping beauty
while i do not think this was a perfect 10 i do agree it was way above a 6 which is what it's rated here no brokedown palace was not perfect and yes it's plot has been done many times before that doesn't mean it shouldn't be done again if it is done well and i think this movie had some strong moments the acting of claire danes as already mentioned many times was flawless as was kate beckinsell and i think bill pullman was absolutely terrific as was the supporting performances pullman's wife the crooked cop skip or trip or whatever his name is the cinematography was also beautifully filmed there was a lot that's good to this movie even if there were some negatives three major ones that i found as well br br here is what i didn't like about it the friendship between the girls in fact the girls' own individual personalities were not developed in depth until the late middle of the pic it would not have been improbable to lose interest before then because despite the positives more character development should have been done earlier on and certain scenes like when the girls were originally arrested were almost glossed over so there was a bit to much jumping around without the character and scene development i think would have been appropriate for this type of film that however is not my major problem and warning spoiler alert br br the ending as mentioned dozens of times already was awful it was awful in two respects firstly even though it would have been predictable and very hollywood i wanted a happy ending yes it was an emotional and powerful ending but in a movie such as this there is a sense that justice will be served and i did sit through it to see that i was genuinely shocked at the ending and it was performed with excellence by all involved but i feel both girls should have got out or barring that at least the cop should have got what was coming to him i mean nothing happens to the bad guys they all get away with it very disturbing br br also i do not understand the ambiguity of the ending i understand endings that are inspired to make one think but this was not a mystery or clue type movie we were watching and i would have liked to know something about what actually happened who was guilty etc with this ending we were left to decide that ourselves but since i somehow doubt there will be a sequel i did not want to be kept guessing br br still there was a lot to like about this movie and the acting is definitely at the top of the list i would rate this a 7 5 and say it is definitely worth a look
there has been a lot of love that has been put into wes anderson's fantastic mr fox unfortunately all the love is for himself granted there has been a lot of time and effort been put into making this ever so self consciously quirky universe but if only the same time and effort had been put into the script to try and make it funny the worrying thing is that i think it was and this is the best that wes anderson could come up with br br the animation is good in the close up shots of the animals however when the camera is further away everything becomes really harsh on the eyes and to be perfectly honest looks like a bit of a mess there wasn't really anything special about the acting either with wes opting to choose his buddies and big names over more specialised voice actors that could have probably made the film better i'm pretty sure george clooney's voice acting resume consists of two cameo appearances in south park one of them where he played a dog br br the film is too smug and trying way too hard to be clever and different and is typically despite the film being set in england all the good animals are typical americans playing baseball whilst the bad guys are stereotypical english with the most insulting english accents i cannot stress how much of a waste of time this film is i didn't laugh once
i rented domino on a whim not even knowing it was inspired by a true story and even though it's the least likely and true biopic you'll probably see i found it to be rather awesome br br with richard kelly writing he crams together a mass of plots and narratives into 2 hours of pure entertainment and once you've seen it more than once you get it and appreciate it br br domino is a model turned bounty hunter who leaves the perfect hollywood life to pursue a not so subtle or perfect career it has an edgy acid trip style provided by director tony scott and with fast paced music and editing it provides the visual flare to keep your attention with slick performances and unexpected comedy the movie is well made and enjoyable and should have reached a wider audience br br i suggest it to anyone who wants to think and be entertained at the same time for 2 hours
the folks at disney have a lot to explain first and foremost why anyone thought this lesser sitcom material would ever make even a half decent motion picture in the kooky 60's teleplay the unique idea of martians among us had not yet been given the sophisticated x files treatment quaint visions of little green men have long since been dispelled by the likes of e t close encounters and aliens 1 3 br br any charm the property had was mainly due to the endearing relationship created between the late bill bixby as tim and ray walston as the unworldly visitor the conceit that martians have antenna seemed dopey back then now it seems positively idiotic yet christopher lloyd's uncle martin sports the metallic appendages in an early shot the antenna on a sign for the tv station tim works at is supposed to make us think martian when's the last time you saw a tv with rabbit ears eh br br disney doesn't trust quaint or relationships and crams this flick with youth wooing special effects that include a talking space suit named zoot yes you read that correctly uncle martin's silver space suit speaks he is supposed to be a real hilarious cut up figure again i got stretch socks that are funnier than zoot whenever the action lags and it lags constantly computer graphics are put into play to liven things up tim is here played by the amiable jeff daniels who can't or won't do anything to save this floudering mess zesty christine ebersole brings some comic zeal to her neighbor lady role even ray walston himself is dragged painfully into the procedings all to no avail this alien visitor is dead on arrival br br constant talk of sitcoms turning to screen makes me only hope that the i dream of jeannie movie won't feature a talking harem outfit i pray that samantha's cat in the movie bewitched doesn't have lines i live in fear that i love lucy the movie will proudly feature a cg conga drum named bongo br br paging michael eisner mickey mouse take me to your leader
any one who has seen mel gibson's the passion of the christ and was bothered by the gory violence would want to see this film instead though it wasn't a success in th box office or tv ratings the fox movie channel still finds a real good motive to show this anually i liked the way that they trained chris sarandon and the men who portrayed his disciples to sing in hebrew though sarandon didn't have long hair like any other jesus would in other films his looks are pretty close to what a jewish man would appear what surprised me or startled me was the scene where caiaphas told jesus about pilate and don't ever forget that you are a jew though that may have not been a racist remark colin blakely was trying to make chris sarandon look like garbage in the eyes of the prominent men of those days keith michell's portrayal of pilate was hulking comparing with his previous performances in the story of jacob and joseph and the story of david but if you compare his portrayal of pilate with telly savala's or hurd hatfield you can say that he really painted well the impression of a roman procurator
come on tina fey you can do better then this as soon as the movie started i knew how it would end sure it was funny at times even laugh out loud funny but there isn't enough laughs to save this movie i don't recommend buying this at the most i recommend renting it but thats all baby mama has some funny scenes but is predictable and fails to have the heartwarming ending it strives for br br tina fey and amy poalher made a good team mean girls is one of my favorite movies tina fey and amy poalher both did great in that and they do good in this but this isn't there best baby mama had a great supporting cast dane cook sigourney weaver and steve martin add to the casts greatness br br another pregnancy movie has hit the cinema world after the great knocked up and juno baby mama looks very average when compared knocked up and juno are hilarious heartwarming and have endings that leave you with a smile on your face baby mama's ending was unfunny and dull br br baby mama wasn't the best comedy of the year and it doesn't try to be i recommend it but don't expect it to be totally hilarious expect a average comedy that doesn't give the big emotional ending it tries to have i give baby mama br br 4 10
recherche is a good word to describe this movie br br let's say every movie has a selling point a gimmick transformers' gimmick is the awesome effects as well as fan boys nostalgia sleepless in seattle's gimmick is situational in their tag line what if someone you never met someone you never saw someone you never knew was the only someone for you many romance relies heavily on these gimmicks and some through draw of big names leap years employs both by using the irish folklore as the circumstance and featuring considerably famous names within the country br br so now that the audience are in the cinema besides all the usual elements in characters conflict or consequences crisis resolve and denouement they also look forward to stimulating dialog more absorbing situations as a result of the leap years interesting sub plots and perhaps to a certain extent a good twist in the middle or towards the end of the story that favors the circumstances of the characters br br this is what jean yeo is trying not to achieve if they've tried to their goal was apparently in the other court at the other stadium on the other end of the planet she and her writer alain layrac utterly failed to provide stimulating dialog most of the lines were contrived it seems that they have a bag filled with lines which she would like to use in her movie okay these are the lines and quotes which i've heard or read from either movies i've seen or books i've read before and they all sound good to me if they sound good to me they will sound good to the audience therefore all i have to do is piece them all together i am going to use all of them the result is cathartic i can't say that the lines were unnecessary and bears no relation to the story or in driving the plot on but they seem to spring out of nowhere catching you off guard with these quotable quotes br br on a personal level i know people who cite quotes based on most of the situations in our dialog trying to make it meaningful to themselves while nodding along i don't go out with them anymore because the urge to punch them is overwhelming br br secondly the characters portrayed are silly and one dimensional with exception to the unnatural dialog which implies their motivation necessary to drive the plot there was no sense of conviction in them i haven't an idea who they are they are all simpletons spouting lines from the advice column of a female oriented magazine br br the gimmick in the leap years is not enough to drive the story on because the circumstances are too shallow then again there are movies with less but fared better than this aren't there they made it up with my first and second point moreover the sub plots are inconsequential not that it's a bad thing for movies and thin bad thing br br jean yeo and the producers are trying to pass off the terrible plot with fancy locations and passable photography this is because they probably understand that it is possible and easier to attain the approval from some viewers than the others with the good use of cinematography soundtrack and filming location these non discerning viewers br br it is not even the kind of movie that is so bad that it's good it is just bad don't watch this
busy is so amazing i just loved every word she has ever done freaks and geeks dawson's creek white chicks the smokers after the first time i saw home room i went and got it the next day i am a big fan of her and she has a lot of fans here in israel if someone hasn't saw is excellent movie than don't waist more time and go see it now i recommend to all of you to see all of her movies i saw busy in the late night show with conan and she was so beautiful and cute i just love her everybody who saw the movie in home room she looks very scary but in real life she is so beautiful you have to see all her half nude pictures for stuff magazine maxim she looks so good there danielle
this film and it's sequel barry mckenzie holds his own are the two greatest comedies to ever be produced a great story a young aussie bloke travels to england to claim his inheritance and meets up with his mates who are just as loveable and innocent as he is br br it's chock a block full of great sayings where else could you find someone who needs a drink so bad that he's as dry as a dead dingoes donger great characters top acting and it's got great sheilas and more fosters consumption then any other three films put together top notch br br and some of the funniest songs you'll ever hear and it's full of great celebrities definitely my two favourite films of all time i watch them at least once a fortnight
this was a disappointment none of the nuance of the original the brits just seem to be able to make a truly unsettling film with none of the over the top histrionics of the american version the original series combined both creepy stories and subtlety of performance with great attention to lighting and settings i have watched the series many times and am still enthralled br br just another poor adaptation along the lines of the dreadful adaptation of cracker get hooked up with bbc america or bbc canada and watch for such delights as waking the dead spooks silent witness and judge john deed watch the original touching evil then look for wire in the blood for more of the truly understated elegant performance of robson green hollywood needs to have a look at this actor
while the main story is supposed to take place in morocco this movie was shot in foggy romania in 18 days on a very tight budget however broken their cards may be the actors and the crew play them with remarkable skill and commitment so that in the end i found the result both touching and graceful nikolaj coaster waldau provides a formidable performance as the bad guy the script and direction provide some gems whether you will like the movie or not however will probably depend on your take on alexandra staden in the title role other reviewers have pointed out staden's inadequacies as modesty blaise they may have a point but i found her interpretation delightful and very fitting modesty manages to overcome terrible odds through discipline innate talent and courage staden appears to be doing the same here
i haven't seen anything this bad since i walked out of the james bond movie moonraker twenty years ago i managed to sit through the entirety of this one only because of tilda swinton but there was nothing she could do to save this beast br br as a cross between pi orlando and tron this movie failed miserably in every aspect of moviemaking the characters were cardboard and unable to evoke any kind of sympathy the plot was wholly unbelievable the acting was with the exception of swinton amateur the computer graphics were worse than in tron timothy leary was extremely annoying i could go on but what's the point br br the only good thing i can say about this film is that tilda swinton was in it i have no idea why an actress of her caliber consented to appear in such a dud but she most likely regrets it now br br don't waste your money or your time on this stinker there's nothing worth seeing here
for a good half hour or so i remember myself thinking hey this could very well be bill rebane's best achievement ever the opening sequences are atmospheric there immediately are some scary moments to enjoy and our director even refers to his own notorious stinker the giant spider invasion in a playful way the concept is shamelessly stolen from william castle's house on haunted hill with three old and extremely bored millionaires luring nine losers to an isolated mansion to win 1 000 000 in an elimination game naturally the participants start vanishing quickly and one by one and it takes the remaining greedy boneheads too much time before they realize either the old folks are sadists or there's another murderer amongst them the film begins ends with an odd narrator telling a lot of senseless stuff that isn't relevant or even interesting to the plot but there's some nice t a to admire in the first ten minutes and that dumb bimbo shelly i believe she's called is really hilarious to observe after the first half hour naturally the inevitable happens and the cold turns into a textbook rebane production with retarded plot twists the dumbest dialogs ever and a total lack of excitement there wasn't any budget for bloody murder sequences but our multi talented director tries to compensate this with endless footage of disco dancing girls and an amateur rock band the film also has four or even five different climaxes and none of them are a slight bit satisfying maybe it was an inspiration for lotr return of the king avoid this film you'll live longer and happier
f ck me i've seen some incredibly horrific movies in my time but this takes the p ss br br honestly i can't express in words how bad this film actually is besides the plot that isn't really there the comically crap acting the hilariously dreadful excuses for zombies you know what i could go on all day every little thing in this film is either stupid pointless crap or embarrassing i express to anyone who wants to watch this movie don't br br i'm ashamed to say i have this on my rack it's hidden away right at the god damn bottom of the huge pile i couldn't even give this horse sh t excuse for a film away that's how bad it is
lots of singing and dancing in this one especially by gene kelly two sailors go on liberty to see if they can find love and romance they meet up with a woman who is trying to break into show business musical lovers only
my first attempt at watching this ended in 8 minutes roughly after the tv report scene which i couldn't handle it went approximately like this br br reporter 1 hmm there's a pyramid in our skies reporter 2 i think it's aliens awkward silence reporter 1 in other news br br a few days later i watched it to the end and it wasn't as horrible as i've imagined but there are serious problems with this about half of the plot can be easily discarded and the other half should be expanded to explain the background story or something br br what use are the detective the eugenics people and the monsters which are disposed of momentarily by horus more amusing was the monopoly scene we're all powerful gods who have lived for aeons and of all the games in the multiverse we happen to play monopoly monopoly monopoly even erich von dainiken looks coherent compared to that br br the other half is terribly lacking what did our protagonist do to get himself cryo frozen why was there no big event when he was released at the end he had those pesky followers remember what happened to normal humans what's the deal with the masked guy how did the blue haired girl appear what's with her eyesight etcetera etcetera br br visually it's ok more or less if you disregard the egyptian gods looking like walking turds with rotweiller heads
the case of the scorpion's tail is a highly stylish giallo directed by sergio martino who appears to be a giallo master second only to dario argento br br ernesto gastaldi wrote this fabulous who dunnit quite complex but ultimately very satisfying and entertaining murder mystery it also makes sense in the end a big plus 'cause that's not always the case for these giallo's as they tend to stretch credibility with their endless red herrings and ultimate solutions here the less you know about the plot the better br br pure giallo trademarks present here are the beautiful cinematography the catchy music score the gorgeous females anita strindberg is a goddess brutal murders black gloved murderers and explicit sex scenes to name a few br br in most parts it's decently acted goerge hilton his usually suave self and others do fairly well martino directs with a sure hand keeps things tight and atmospheric with some terrific set pieces br br if you're a giallo fan this is a must see if you like well written and suspenseful thrillers in general this comes highly recommended
read my lips sur mes lèvres which probably has different idiomatic resonance in its french title is a nifty twisty contemporary tale of office politics that unexpectedly becomes a crime caper as the unusually matched characters slide up and down an ethical and sensual slippery slope br br the two leads are magnetic emmanuelle devos who i've never seen before despite her lengthy resume in french movies and an even more disheveled than usual vincent cassel who has brought a sexy and or threatening look and voice to some us movies br br the first half of the movie is on her turf in a competitive real estate office and he's the neophyte the second half is on his turf as an ex con and her wrenching adaptation to that milieu br br writer director jacques audiard very cleverly uses the woman's isolating hearing disability as an entrée for us into her perceptions turning the sound up and down for us to hear as she does so it's even more annoying than usual when audience members talk using visuals as sensory reactors as well br br none of the characters act as anticipated she is not like that pliable victim from in the company of men not in individual interactions not in scenes and not in the overall arc of the unpredictable story line well until the last shot but heck the audience was waiting for that fulfillment as we move from a hectic modern office to a hectic disco to romantic and criminal stake outs br br there is a side story that's thematically redundant and unnecessary but that just gives us a few minutes to catch our breaths br br this is one of my favorites of the year br br originally written 7 28 2002
the adaptation of will eisner's spirit to the tv screen followed many other offerings developed from comic strip pages or comic books remember the two aren't exactly the same medium it is indeed ironic that this is the one and only adaptation as of the time of this writing of eisner's smart alec wise cracking tongue in cheek super hero br br story has it that republic pictures was interested in doing a film version and was in negotiation with the copyright owner in the mid '40's but they were never able to close the deal the left over screen play became the serial the masked marvel one of republic's best perhaps that it was just as well for that studio had a penchant for tinkering with material adapted from the comic strips pulp mags radio and the comic books br br as for this 1987 made for tv movie it's pretty obvious that it was a failed pilot for a proposed television series whereas an old long time comic reader like myself can be a little harsh in criticism of an adaptation a viewer unfamiliar with the character may be able to give some fresh observations clear of any preconceived notions of what this screen version should look like br br well while sitting and watching the story unfold with the characters interacting amid some crime wave the little lady my wife mrs ryan nailed it with one statement this can't make up its mind if it's serious or not that pretty well describes both the spirit and his creator mr will eisner the true creative genius in the comics br br the film is a sincere attempt to put eisner's world on the screen the casting of denny colt the spirit commissioner dolan and ellen was really quite well done though in a contemporary setting it was still in the tradition of the good old days as far as the costuming goes you know when men and women still wore hats that brings up this one final and meandering point and that is that the director and the production made a conscious effort and succeeded in giving the characters a will eisner look as far as facial expressions and body language we say kudos to them for their efforts br br it's just too bad that no series followed oh well in today's motion picture world comic adaptations seem to be a hot item maybe some big timer producer and director could do a really 1st class spirit production for the big screen we can only hope br br update dateline chicago illinois 6 4 2008 by now everyone who goes to the movies at the shopping centre multiplexes has seen the poster advertising the new film of the spirit subtitled my city screams which is to be released christmas day 2008 well we'll see then just what we've been talking about just keep your fingers crossed to be continued br br update ii we saw the new film writer director frank miller's rendition of the spirit a couple of days ago well we got our wish but is this a good thing or another case of be careful what you ask for because you may get it please read our write up elsewhere in imdb com thanx
i recently watched the '54 version of this film with judy and while i appreciated the story and music i found that the film failed to hold my attention i expected the '76 remake to be the same story except with a barbra twist i was pleasantly surprised it was a much more realistic and modern look at fame money love and the price of it all this version is so much more real than the '54 one with arguably better music better acting a more gripping plot line and of course a deeper love i do not understand why the previous film is on the american film institute's top 100 list while this gripping remake fails to make a mark on any critic's list
fido is a story about more well mannered zombies who have been trained to serve the human race all falls apart though when young timmy's zombie fido eats the family neighbor from then on disaster well maybe not disaster but to some extent chaos occurs most of the people treat their zombies with fairness and one such character sleeps with his zombie very funny part of the movie if not also very disturbing too and we find the loving fido whatever he may do this is a very funny and unique film especially for the zombie genre it is also probably one of the least violent of zombie movies no negativity in this statement i very much recommend it to people who are looking for something funny and different i rate this 8 10 rated r for zombie related violence
this beautifully filmed and scripted episode was let down for two reasons 1 perhaps it was the morality of the 1950s talking but no man left alone on an asteroid for years would react with such hysterical negativity to the gift of a female android 2 it wasn't an android at all but a woman the beautiful jean marsh br br the popularity of the sex doll industry in the coming decades could have traced its origins back to this episode if they'd done it properly in fact the modernization of sex bots are in the news as i speak br br robots were not new to movies or television when this episode was made so they could have at least had her act like one her fleshiness would then have added a creepy element instead it becomes a nice little love story about two humans on faraway star br br the twilight zone always stretched the imagination and credulity normally no one cared but this episode seemed hamstrung by a calvinist morality eschewing what would have amounted to masturbation with a machine or downright carelessness
you don't expect much from a prc picture and with rare exceptions mainly from edgar g ulmer and a few by joseph h lewis or lew landers that's exactly what you get not much this epic about nazis in africa trying to incite an arab revolt against the british isn't much different the script by longtime prc hacks arthur st claire and sherman lowe is trite laughable full of unfunny wisecracks and plot holes the size of outer mongolia the direction by longtime prc no budget specialist al herman is semi comatose at best the performances though except for spectacularly incompetent and irritatingly hammy lead walter woolf king aren't really half bad veteran comedian parkyakarkus is actually the best thing about the film he plays a guy from brooklyn masquerading as a razor blade salesman and brightens up the screen considerably when he shows up he's got great comic timing charm to spare and seems to be having a heck of a good time duncan renaldo is fairly convincing as an arab sheik despite his spanish accent and veteran bad guy george j lewis as renaldo's arab rival does his usual fine job of villainy even if he goes a bit over the top sometimes joan woodbury is quite pretty and has a nice light touch and she and renaldo have great chemistry together although like the rest of the cast she has none at all with king h b warner whose career stretched back to the silent era lends a shred of dignity to the low rent proceedings even though he blows his lines several times and prc being prc they weren't cut out there's a great deal of stock footage spliced in from a big budget silent movie with a similar arab theme although i have no idea which one it is and prc being prc no effort was made to try to make it inconspicuous i've seldom seen stock footage that was so blatantly obvious br br a yank in libya isn't very good of course well ok it stinks but it would be worth a look just to see parkyakarkus in his prime i had heard of him and knew that he was the father of actor director albert brooks and super dave osborne but had never actually seen him in anything before it was worth watching this tenth rate prc extravaganza just to see him in action otherwise forget it
i was first introduced to eddie by friends from across the pond who know i like intelligent humor i prefer comedians who can be thought provoking while entertaining such as george carlin and dennis miller in 'dress to kill' eddie provides the same type of social observation humor that stimulates your thoughts on a subject all the while causing your side to split at the same time there is a wide range of subjects in this stand up and they are simply hysterical the piece on how to decide on englebert's stage name will leave you in stitches br br thanks andrew and catherine and do you have a flag
jennifer's shadow is set in argentina starts as jennifer cassi gina philips arrives there after her sister johanna dies jennifer is left johanna's large house in her will jennifer decides to sell the house head back to los angeles even though her grandmother mary ellen faye dunaway is opposed to the sale however strange things begin to happen jennifer starts having nightmares about ravens pecking at her she starts to feel very ill after a check up in hospital it seems that one of her kidney's have mysteriously disappeared what is happening to jennifer is it an ancient family curse will jennifer be the next to succumb to it br br this argentinian american co production was co written co directed by daniel de la vega pablo parés is a really dull waste of ninety odd minutes a tedious predictable modern ghost story that i would imagine will put more people to sleep sooner than scare them the script by vega parés p j pettiette is pretty slow going tedious which is not what anyone wants i mean i'm sure most people don't want to sit down be bored out of their skulls the character's are all uninteresting fairly faceless with little or no motivation for anything they do for instance who is that graveyard caretaker guy how did he know about the demons what is his interest motivation for getting involved i couldn't see it jennifer herself is a pretty unlikable bland leading lady her grandmother mary allen is as clichéd as they come it's surprising that she is so obviously the villain i mean for this sort of mystery based horror ghost story it's surprisingly predictable routine there are gaps in both logic the story which together with the terrible twist ending which isn't much of a twist i didn't like jennifer's shadow one iota br br directors vega parés goes down the much used route of bleaching almost all of the colour from the picture which often renders it not too far from black and white i suspect that they wanted to give it a period gothic feel but it's been done so many times before often so much better that it didn't do much for me at all just makes the whole film look dull lifeless there's a definite 40's period look as well from the costumes to the interior of the large house but again it's rather half hearted cheap looking jennifer's shadow is well made but it's rather forgettable it's not scary or creepy it's rather predictable if that wasn't enough there's no gore either there's a few scenes of ravens pecking away at people a beating heart but nothing else br br with a supposed budget of about 1 000 000 retitled to the chronicles of the raven for it's us international dvd release this is reasonably well made but a million won't buy you too much these days jennifer's shadow pretty much proves that theory there are too many scenes of actor's speaking in thick argentinian accents as well even though it might be realistic i actually like to be able to understand what people are saying the acting is alright although dunaway overacts badly is obviously there for the money br br jennifer's shadow is a rubbishy ghost film that i thought was a total bore from start to finish i would rather watch the incredibly strange creatures who stopped living and became mixed up zombies 1964 again instead a total waste of time
it all starts with a suicide or is it a car crash i guess it all depends on whether you choose to start at the beginning or the end director gabriele muccino gives you the ability to enter his new film seven pounds whichever way you prefer as he starts at the end and works his way back to the beginning showing us the course of events that led us to that heartbreaking 911 call this is one powerful movie maybe that is because i'm a softy when it comes to dramas of this ilk dripping with weighty moments and chock full of devastating performances but either way a film works best when it truly touches me when it lingers in the back of my head hours after leaving the theatre and this is from the team that brought us the overrated sappy and not all that redeeming pursuit of happiness so i'll just say my anticipation was closely guarded for a big letdown with all that though i was with seven pounds from the opening frame all the way until the credits rolled even though you figure out what will smith's character is doing that secret mission he is trying to complete it is the way in which he fulfills his penance that shines bright and leaves you with a tear filled smile at the end br br our entry point is a bit jarring leaving us off kilter trying to comprehend what is going on smith's thomas has lists of names one of people we don't know and one of people it appears he is attempting to follow and audit working with the irs allows him access to these strangers for a glimpse into their lives in order to see whether they are worthy of a gift he has the power to give thema gift that could completely alter their circumstances he calls an old childhood friend barry pepper and reminds him to do what it is he promised to not second guess his decision because there is no changing his mind even in a role as small as pepper's you can't help but feel the utter grief held aloft in the background hanging above everyone's head it is his character seen maybe three times that really encompasses the primal level of emotion being dealt with his breakdowns whether tear streaked and composed or head in hands convulsions show the bond these two men have is one that stands the test of time and any circumstance to come its way br br after that phone call begins the journey to meet new people thomas is on some sort of mission to help alleviate the monetary troubles of mortally ill folk trying to stay afloat despite the heavy burden of medical bills and survival this progression takes many turns from a blind vegan meat salesman that he berates to see whether he can get him to explode to a phase two donor necessity heart patient unable to print her line of stationary or even run with her great dane duke to an abused and scared latino mother of two too afraid to leave her boyfriend to a dying hockey coach that instills faith in a downtrodden youth community to a little boy in need of a bone marrow transplant there are people who live with the pain and inevitable future with a disposition of hope and wanting to cherish each day and there are those attempting to beat it by cutting corners and spending all their money at the expense of those who need it to go out in style why it is up to thomas to weed through the mix and find those that deserve his gift is unknown at first as is why this man seen in flashbacks as an aeronautical engineer with a beautiful wife and huge beachfront home is now living in a motel driving a beat up car going door to door in order to audit for the irs as he says though he kind of stumbled into the job br br smith's quest as thomas is a long and painful one tempered with moments of clarity and honest compassion as a man with the means to help he takes his job seriously crossing off people undeserving and testing those he believes are worthy to the nth degree if that means he must yell and make fun of them he must do it at every step though you see the suffering in his eyes the pain eating away at his soul taking each step towards his fate one as a saint of redemption not only for those he wants to help but for himself as well it is an award worthy performance and i only wish smith would do more dramas like this instead of his blockbuster action summer tentpoles because while they are fun this guy is too good for them the man better win an oscar before he is done or it will be a travestyat least in my mind br br the rest of the cast is stellar across the board woody harrelson as the blind salesman is pitch perfect handicap with a joy of life his shy smile and belief in humanity comes across throughout whether on the phone being yelled at sitting in a diner eating his pie or at the piano in the park playing for all who will listen elpidia carrillo as the abused mother is fantastic showing the hard evolution from prideful to scared to completely overwhelmed by the kindness of a stranger allowing her family to finally be safe and rosario dawson shines as the once hot young woman beaten and broken by lengthy hospital stays all but given up on living life to find love and happiness it is the introduction of smith's thomas that opens her eyes again to be a woman a free spirited sexual creature that can just live without fear of wondering what day will be her last
i instantly fell in love with pushing daisies this show manages to put a smile on my face with it's great storytelling witty dialog and great acting but that's not all it also manages to keep you until the end the basic idea behind the show bringing people back to life with one touch ending the undead status with a second is interesting and could still be in later seasons but the suspenseful murder cases the unique look of the show and the highly proficient narrator add to the experience but pushing daisies is more than it's parts it has a certain charm that i really enjoy and i'm looking forward to enter the world of ned and chuck for a second season
this is a truly abysmal lock stock' clone with a stellar cast and a terrible script i have no idea why so many top british actors signed up to this junk they must have been bribed a miss match of a storyline goes on forever and ever and ever and if i hadn't have paid good money for it i'd have turned it off after 10 minutes not the worst film ive ever seen that honour goes to the truly pathetic used bogroll of a movie' i use the term loosely gummo' i feel like suing that so called director' for the lost hour and a half of my life but this trash is nearly right down there with it definitely one of the worst 5 films i have ever seen stuff like this reminds hollywood that they don't have a monopoly on truly awful films
if you want to watch a good film about how women can fight back against sexual assault then this film is not the film that you want to watch it was a social commentary about a woman who was victimized and fights back spoiler rosario dawson turns the tables on her assailant instead of using the criminal justice system the victim resorts to using vigilantism she in essence nullifies the judicial system the film the accused was a much better film because the victim uses the judicial system and wins what the descent does is telling victims of assault that they should resort to violence is victim any better that the accuser no
don't waste 90 minutes of your time on fast food fast women it's annoyingly episodic script with three story lines patched together is laughably bad due to predictable writing horrific acting and even bad music i found the anorexic main character upsetting to watch every time she was on screen she needs the fast food br br spend the 90 minutes you'd devote to this turkey doing something more exciting like trimming your toenails you'd have more entertainment value br br the only redeeming thing about this film is louise lasser but she deserves much better than this tired script it's as impotent as the elder guy she courts in the movie br br viewer beware
assuming this won't end up a straight to video release i would have to say void this title at all costs unless you're bored of good well executed movies that is i saw this last night at afi dallas and i left with 20 minutes remaining simply because i didn't care anymore about the plot not about insulting the director that is awkward when you can spot a goof only 5 minutes into the movie a shot out shattered window before any shots are fired and then the window breaks with the first shot things are going to bad let's just say this is only an indicator of things to come unfortunately br br i'll spare you all the details but this is sub par in every manner even the half assed acting by michael madsen is disappointing when you're expecting half assed acting from him and the rape scene christ shut up and take it should never be used in a rape scene ever br br 3 10
my wife is a fanatic as regards this show that being the case i bought her seasons one through three and season four is on order i personally think the show is one big farce the cast is equally bad alyssa milano should have stuck to the other trash movies she made such as poison ivy embrace of the vampire to name a few the other female supporting cast members are equally inept in their portrayals i've seen better special effects in the old republic pictures serials i saw as a child i can understand why the male leads remained on the show for such short periods of time even though i don't know if it was their own choosing or not please please don't renew for another season as enough is enough bob
although misty ayers burlesque stripper is certainly attractive as the blonde lead this flick is just an excuse to let her strip down to her underwear a few times no nudity in 1954 when this film was made not 1965 br br the guy who hires her to work in a whorehouse resembles bud abbott of abbott costello most of the other woman are unattractive and the drunken woman is semi amusing in a creepy way br br a 2 out of 10 ms ayers has a curvacious physique but you can't judge any acting talent because the entire film is post dubbed some of these exploitation films usually made later than this one are interesting in some way but this is really a bore fest sid melton make room for daddy directed there are some samurai like facial expressions and interesting apartments but there's really nothing here
mahatma has been depicted as a man who neglected his own son in this movie don't get me wrong i am not condemning the movie it is such a wonderful movie and walked out of the cinema with a lump in my throat we need to understand mahatma's spiritual standing he is a true spiritual leader only a fully enlightened man could possibly detach himself from his loved ones a man with such caliber leads his family and followers by example according to the movie he spoke to his son and try to make him understand where he is coming from but poor harilall with so little intellect could not understand his father when things went wrong with harilall mahatma could remain calm and accepted that his son is a big tragedy br br had it been any other parents they would have compromised their values to assist the son to get on his feet mahatma didn't do that he is true leader who leads by example
baby face is a precode melodrama starring a very young barbara stanwyck an almost unrecognizable george brent and theresa harris it's about a girl who goes to the city to make good or should i say make time stanwyck's father has been pimping her for one reason or another her whole life in dingy depressed filthy erie pennsylvania after her father dies one older father type who knows what she's been through and truly cares about her future advises her to go to the big city and take advantage of opportunities there and not the easy ones and to take the high road in life note that i saw the censored version and not the uncut this part of the film was redone for the censors she and chico harris go to new york where lily nickname baby face decides the low road's a lot smoother and will get her where she wants to go a lot faster in the movie's most famous scene the camera moves us up the corporate ladder by taking us from floor to floor as lily sleeps her way to the top she finally corrals the big man himself and is able to quit her day job trouble follows and she's soon involved in a huge scandal br br stanwyck wears lots of makeup and for most of the film is cool as a cucumber as she seduces one man after another with no regrets and she's great at playing the innocent victim in one scene she sits staring at a king's ransom in jewels while wearing a black dress that looks like it's decorated with diamonds at the top then she asks chico for another case and that's filled with more jewelry plus securities all in a day's work br br theresa harris was an interesting talent she could be played down or glamorous and was a talented singer and dancer as well here she sings or hums the movie's theme st louis woman throughout she worked in literally dozens of movies and is very good here as a friend of stanwyck's her best work being in the precode era as a bizarre byproduct of the code blacks were often given less to do in films after it was put in place br br precode films could be more sexually blatant and therefore though they're 70 years old seem more modern even though these films didn't have to have moral endings baby face learns her lessons how like life it is after all there were several endings of this film all with the same message the one i saw had an added scene but apparently there were two other endings that didn't pass the censors there wasn't a code but there were always censors at any rate it's a neat surprise baby face is an important film in movie history a must see
there were times when this movie seemed to get a whole lot more complicated than it needed to be but i guess that's part of it's charm detective philo vance's powers of observation seem greater than all the oriental sleuths of the era combined when it comes down to that final evaluation of how the murders were committed the dropping of the dagger into the chinese vase was the kicker for me i mean couldn't somebody have just dropped it br br vance william powell had a line early in the film about archer coe's 'psychological impossibility' to kill himself i had to think about that for a while i was left wondering if there's some scientific basis in fact for that concept to be true not having studied psychology myself seems logical but then there's always the case that doesn't fit the rules br br you know i got a kick out of the agitated coroner etienne girardot who reminded me of star trek's dr mccoy the couple of times he stated i'm a doctor not a magician and i'm a doctor not a detective i can picture deforrest kelley watching the film and saying to himself 'i'll have to use that sometime' br br once the killer's identity is revealed it doesn't seem like such a big surprise but up till then it's really anybody's guess but archer and brisbane coe aside the film didn't answer the central question posed by the title and the murder i was really interested in who killed sir thomas macdonald's dog ghillie
those who love the book jane eyre as i do it's my all time favorite and i re read it at least once a year will love this version timothy dalton is just a tad too good looking to be mr rochester but other than that he does a marvelous job portraying the brooding master of thornfield zelah clarke may have been just a little too old to play the 18 year old jane but when i watch this movie i don't think about the ages of the characters the dialog from the film is taken almost verbatim from the book which was very smart sure this film might seem a little long but it's the only version i've seen that includes part 3 of the story br br i wish the people who made this film had been involved in the newer zeferelli version as it would have helped that mess of a film br br i also realized the last time i watched this video that judy cornwell plays aunt reed she is so versatile that i didn't recognize her she plays daisy in keeping up appearances and also played mrs musgrove in 1995's persuasion another wonderful adaption br br update got the dvd this week and it's marvelous to see the original unedited version there's lots more at the beginning young jane at gateshead and at lowood and at the end they've restored lots of things i always wondered why st john had a slip of paper when he reveals that he knows who jane is because the part where he tears it from her painting was edited out of the us vhs version rosamund oliver is in it she was completely cut out of the vhs as far as i could tell they hadn't edited out any of timothy dalton's parts so nothing new there but it is great to see the whole miniseries in its entirety after all these years of enjoying the vhs thanks bbc ps i would have paid more for a special edition dvd with maybe some interviews with the stars or a making of show
this film is fun if your a person who likes a good campy feature film every now and then by no means is this movie fine cinema but if you dont take things too seriously and can laugh at yourself once in a while elvira is a good frownbuster
when i heard this film was directed by ang lee i made sure to see it this taiwanese director burst into fame with the wedding banquet and eat drink man woman a few years ago and then moved on to sense and sensibility and the ice storm now he turns his attention to another american icon the civil war br br this story takes place in missouri a union state with southern sympathies these never officially joined the confederate army instead they formed outlaw bands called bushwhackers grew they hair long and sometimes would confiscated union uniforms which they wore over their regular clothing br br the movie depicts their moral dilemma the high drama of the times and their supposedly heroic missions of killing storekeepers and farmers who aided the union there are no stars in this movie unless you consider jewel the singer well cast as a young confederate widow as a star br br tobey macquire is cast as a young german farm boy who is derided for his heritage because the germans were supposed union sympathizers this young man is an excellent actor full of fresh faced youth whose performance encompasses his wonder and subtle realizations as he's exposed to the horror of war br br jeffrey wright is a freed slave who travels with the bushwhackers because of his loyalty to the young man who bought him his freedom he gives a fine and understated performance br br some of the acting however is wooden especially in the long conversations they have about morality and their costumes are too new and the southern gentleman theme of manners and hat tipping and politeness to women comes across as a bit much especially since they make it a point to murder all the men who they pull from their women's arms then burn down the stores and houses br br while i don't think that this will go down as one of lee ang's great movies i did find myself fascinated by it in spite of the slow parts and its excessive length of 140 minutes i was interested in what was happening next and felt empathy for each of the characters who all came across as real and imperfect human beings caught up in the forces of history br br not as much action as the usual war movie but yet still recommended especially for civil war buffs br br
i have never read the book a wrinkle in time to be perfectly honesty after seeing the movie do i really want to well i shouldn't be reviewing this movie i'll start off with that next i'll say that the tv movie is pretty forgettable do you know why i say that because i forgot what happens in it i told you it was forgettable to be perfectly honest no tv movie will ever be better than merlin br br how do i describe a tv movie i have never written a review for one before well i'll just say that they usually have some celebrities a wrinkle in time includes only one alfre woodard or woodward i am not sure the oscar winner br br the film has cheesy special effects a mildly interesting plot scenes that make you go wtf the movie is incredibly bad and it makes you go wtf what did i expect it's a tv movie they usually aren't good as is this one a wrinkle in time is a waste of time and a big time waster to top it off you'll most likely forget about it the second it's over well maybe not the second it's over but within a few minutes br br a wrinkle in time
this is a terrible terrible film br br first of all tooo long the longest movie i have ever seen br br the stories are all too damn over the top br br as a matter of fact there are too many stories that the story line is ruined br br the comedy wasn't comedy it wasn't funny at all br br the story is so repulsive and badly written that it doesnot matter if the characters live or die br br i had some expectations from this movie but my expectations were crashed completely in the first few minutes br br the only thing good about this movie is the music and obviously vidya balan she gives the best performance and stands out among all the senior actors she's just a new comer and yet she shines and makes the rest of the cast look so pathetic govinda and the blonde who playes his love interest also help saving this disastrous movie govinda perfectly fits in the role of the taxi driver and the blonde also gives a very subtle and consistent performance br br another talented actress ayesha takiya is completely wasted in this movie so is priyanka akshay does his role well but it seemed too over the top anil and juhi are also totally wasted br br the only one not wasted is salman because he has no talent what so ever to be wasted br br all in all this is a very impossible movie with mishmashed screenplay and tooo masladar that the storyline is shaped according to the stupid comedy scenes imagine how stupid this movie is br br 3 10 it is four hours long think and rethink before going to the cinemas better avoid it
why on earth should you explore the mesmerizing nature documentary earth how much time do you have on earth so i can explain this to you ok i will not elongate my review exploration on earth to infinity but i must stand my ground on why this is a must see the documentary takes a nature round trip on the migration paths on three animal families a female polar bear and her cubs with the real life subplot of the father bear daring it out to hunt for food in his isolated path a mama of a whale with her baby whale taking a whale of a migration tour for prey and an elephant mama with her small maybe not so small they are elephants offspring migrating in africa directors alastair forthegill mark linfield did an out of this earth job in also capturing the survival skills of many other animal species besides the magnetic shots of our three animal family protagonists the cinematographically skilled team of richard brooks burton mike holding adam ravetch and andrew shillabeer were animales in camera shooting the wondrous nature sites and animal instinctive behaviors not to mention the slo mo animal prey shots were u n b e l i e a v a b l e earth is also a lesson learner on the global warming effect on the animals the papa polar bear in the doc is the poster animal boy on that consequence so fellow earthlings it is time to take the documentary voyage to visit earth today good
after seeing the 1996 remake i thought it was the funniest way to see cruella de vil getting her punishment for torturing animals just for their skin the whole movie was quite funny and on my view better than the animated one but there was actually no need for a second one first of all if cruela is returning don't cure her and make her insane again just make her break away from jail and that's a rap i thought it was not very funny it's supposed to have only one original puppy returning i'd expected that it should be lucky since he was the most appealing and besides having roger and anita back too however they decided to have a complete recasting and adding not really one hundred not even one hundred and two but only three puppies and a parrot that thinks he's a dog clever gerard depardieu's part was pointless at the end cruella suffers way too much way too humiliating and way too exaggerated to be true she gets baked inside a giant cake that was a desperate attempt of physical humor trying to imitate the same effect from the first one that just didn't work it was too much over the top and not too funny i actually felt sorry about cruella
xizao is the tale about the clash of modern life and ancient traditions and its effects on a family in china da ming quanxiu pu is a businessman who returns home when a letter sent by his brother er ming wu jiang makes him believe that his father liu xu zhu has died he founds that his father is still alive as well as his old neighborhood and his father old business the public bathroom br br the movie centers around da ming's family and how he has to learn the importance of his father's job something he always had considered an old tradition that had to die soon also the movie explores his relationship with er ming who is mentally challenged and the problems of the small community and how the bathroom is a place that purifies not only their bodies but also their souls br br the two main themes of the movie the family and the problems of progress are incredibly well handled and the movie never loses the point it is trying to make both themes are very good developed and we get a glimpse of chinese society and customs br br the director yang zhang tells his tale in a simple way letting the characters characters do the job it is a very simple approach but it fits the movie perfectly and i highly doubt that another style would fit the movie this good zhang has enormous potential as he can tell a story without the aid of visual flare or camera tricks br br the acting is outstanding in its naturalistic approach everyone acts in a very natural way and it almost looks as if they were real persons being filmed the three lead characters give remarkable performances and wu jiang as er ming surely steals the show br br even when the movie could had sticked to a patronizing old days were much better message instead it takes an attitude of equilibrium like saying that progress is good and we must move on but we must not forget where we came from and keep an equilibrium between modern life and the traditions of old br br an awesome and touching film 8 10
there's not much to say about this one gammera is some kind of fire breathing turtle he is loosed by a nuclear explosion he heads for land and begins to destroy building and tanks and other junk oh yeah power lines i almost forgot at one time early in the film he befriends a little boy and instead of just throwing him away or squashing him he places him down on the ground safe from then on we have to watch this chubby faced little twerp show up and run away show up and run away show up and run away for some reason gammera is able to hear this kid from 20 000 feet away oh well the plot is to try to get gammera to get to a place where he can be put on board a rocket and shot into space as usual the monster is lumbering and uncoordinated a guy in a gammera suit the japanese army with the help of americans uses up enough ammunition and fire power to solve the national debt and of course it does no good they should know this anyway we've seen a lot of monsters stomp on tokyo not to put these down because they can be fun but it's really not very good
hobgoblins is a very cheap and badly done gremlins rip off that's the best thing one can say about this stinkpile pretty much everyone in the cast was chosen for their looks and not their acting ability it was very painful to watch br br avoid this one at all costs
this film concerns purportedly non establishment types aesthetically and sexually who apparently cannot resist basic romantic needs although some excellent players take part including jon tenney timothy olyphant and cynthia nixon they are grounded by a puerile script which relies nearly totally upon clever dialogue which isn't nixon's role possesses the best lines but she often homes in on them too quickly a timing flaw which must be saddled upon the director the grotesque climax utilizes every available cliche spent or not and fittingly ends this drab attempt at comedy
curiously it is rene russo's eyes and mouth not buddy the gorilla's that emerge as the focal point of buddy a jim henson pictures production through francis ford coppola's zoetrope somehow countless close ups of russo's face slipped passed in the post production stages and she literally fills the screen so many times the poor apes are upstaged unintentionally funny true story adapted from gertrude trudy davies lint's memoirs about a wealthy doctor's wife who turns their mansion into a menagerie for pets and wild life the movie goes beyond good intentions it positively drips with earnest sincerity the movie never sparkles with the kind of family film magic that it needed and before too long both the people and the animals seem distinctly programmed nothing here feels real about ten minutes in two chimpanzees are goofing around in russo's kitchen and start throwing a butcher's knife back and forth it misses alan cumming's head by inches yet no eyebrows are raised because it's all in a day's fun still when full grown gorilla buddy gets crazy during a thunderstorm the cops are called and everyone stares at buddy through the window while he busts up the living room furniture the furniture should be the least of anyone's worries in this flabbergasting do gooder failure but at least we know russo was in good hands whenever director caroline thompson needs a good pick up shot she gives unstartled rene another extreme close up i wonder what the lipstick budget was on this picture from
the intruder l'intrus is a visual pilgrimage through a mysterious life br br grizzled michel subor plays louis trebor like jason bourne as an old man with a hidden past living simply in an isolated hut in the woods for justifiably paranoid reasons but attracting pretty young women who can be useful to him we learn more about him through dreams flashbacks and a journey that may unfold chronologically or not as well as through his brusque interactions with family lovers business associates and a striking nemesis like the limey the film resonates with parent child regrets and a suspicious past revealed through clips from an old film with the same actor as a young man here paul gégauff's 1965 adventure film le reflux br br in a complete contrast of moods we meet his son sidney grégoire colin who has to be the sexiest house husband in the world as he sweetly and seductively does household repairs and cares for a baby a toddler and every need of his working wife surely director co writer claire denis must have created him as a woman's fantasy if ever there was one and a lesson to other filmmakers on filming foreplay there's an additional extended scene where he seeks his father in the woods while carefully carrying his angelic baby in a pouch he is everything his father is not and has every relationship his father is incapable of sustaining no wonder he thinks his father is a lunatic i spent the rest of the film in dread that something bad would happen to him as the true nature of the heart of his alienated father is very gradually played out before our eyes br br the film is a puzzle but subor is ruthlessly fascinating as we watch him traverse countries and negotiate nefarious deals and the voice over narration for denis's beau travail was annoying anyway we have to figure out from skylines and incidental signage that he is traveling to geneva korea and the south pacific time passing is indicated by the seasons changing and scars being created and healing there are lots of images of water for cleansing and for distancing br br continuing her fascination with the morphing of colonialism into globalization as well as playing a bit on stereotypes of the mysterious orient and russian criminals denis has incorporated elements from robert louis stevenson paul gauguin and marlon brando's tahiti idylls and a 40 page memoir by french philosopher jean luc nancy the last for the title and heart transplant plot used for an ironic theme of limited immortality which does have consequences br br while louis thinks he's succeeded in being above boundaries rules and morals there is some amusement in the last act as the locals don't quite know what to do with him and try to help him solve his quixotic odyssey even as he again lies in isolation br br several people in the audience left in frustration at the elliptical but strikingly beautiful story telling method the unconventional narrative does raise a lot of plot questions on details
the original book of this was set in the 1950s but that won't do for the tv series because most people watch for the 1930s style ironically the tube train near the end was a 1950s train painted to look like a 1930s train so the underground can play at that game too hanging the storyline on a plot about the jarrow march was feeble but the 50s version had students who were beginning to think about the world around them so i suppose making them think about the poverty of the marchers is much the same thing all the stuff about japp having to cater for himself was weak too but they had to put something in to fill the time this would have made a decent half hour show or they could have filmed the book and made it a better long show it is obvious this episode is a victim of style over content
firstly i must admit that it isn't a good movie and i would never watch this movie if pacino wasn't in it br br the movie is about a publicist's strange 24 hours and he is overworked dizzy sick and sometimes regretful i don't like the character at all it's really boring after 20 minutes you may fall asleep and i don't understand why pacino wanted to be a part of this horrible movie just because of money or what br br since i'm an avid pacino fan i bought this 2002 movie people i know if you haven't bought it yet don't even think about it it's just a waste of time
a slasher flick made in the early 80's has a curse on it which has anyone who tries to finish it turning up dead years later a group of film students attempted to complete the movie also resurrecting the films deadly curse great idea for a film but sadly 'cut' is just another wasted opportunity br br unfortunately australia hasn't had the world's best track record when it comes to horror 'razorback' 1984 was an out and out dud as was 'holwing iii' 1987 which was half an american film anyway as for our foray into comedy horror 'body melt' 1993 is best left forgotten the problem with 'cut' is that the makers trying to create a clever horror satire a la 'scream' 1996 but have no insight into the genre or what makes it work and although this sounds weird me saying this about a slasher film but what 'cut' really lacks is any heart sure it follows the basic rules established by 'scream' but it doesn't want to play with the formula instead it goes for a cardboard copy of the earlier br br the killer scarman is probably one of the most boring and uncharismatic villains in horror movie history his endless barrage awkwardly lame one liners would make the dialogue of a porno seem like shakespeare the cast never seem like their fully involved and look like their just waiting for a shoot to be over so they can collect their pay checks and the feel of the film is like it's deliberately trying not to be creepy looking more like an episode of 'neighbors' or 'heartbreak high' by the way those attempts at mtv style hyper cinema during the research sequence just look lame dated and out of place br br if australia ever gets a chance to do horror again which i hope we still do maybe we should take a leaf from the 'mad max' 1979 book instead of trying to copy the u s we should be trying our own take on the genre
you know you're in trouble when john cassavetes is operating at half speed instead of full throttle in a movie and the incubus is a dreadful worst case scenario of a great actor going through the motions to pay the bills actually observing the hammy script and john hough's 'baroque' art direction one can hardly blame him the movie has something to do with a series of rape murders going on in a small town with a lot of supernatural hokum mixed in somehow the direction manages to suck tension and interest out of every scene and cassavetes seems visibly p o 'ed at times the incubus itself which doesn't show up until the last scene is a well done creation but it's not worth waiting for br br 1 10
i would of given this film a zero out of ten but i will give it a two reason one is that shah rukh khan appears in the film which is not really a reason last point is that rani appears in this film and does a smooch with kamal i love rani very much and have a respect that she is a great actress which is why i didn't enjoy her in this movie kissing kamal but its no big deal anyway enough of the bedroom scenes that made this film noticeable lets actually talk about this film is it good or bad i think its a completely rubbish movie that made me yawn me being a fantastic critic you can see my other 250 review's by clicking on my name i have great taste the movie is not entertaining is one thing and if this is suppose to be hard hitting cinema why is there no morale in this movie its a biased movie thats not a true story and it stinks watching kamal kissing these actresses makes me sick man cant kiss properly anyway
an excellent and accurate film mcgovern takes great pains to research and document his writing and it pays off he is not afraid to tell the truth even though it might draw unfavourable reviews and comments from some who like stories to be clean and sweet and glossy br br once again mcgovern brings in christopher eccleston though not in as high a profile a role as he played in hillsborough i found this movie as accurate well acted and well presented as hillsborough and i applaud mcgovern for his poignant unapologetic writing well done and my hat is off to the writer the actors the production crew a great film
although the flock has some pretty good acting by veteran richard gere and some okay shots that might harken some back to the silence of the lambs days the movie stretches credibility to the breaking point and destroys itself against a plot that really leads nowhere br br the film is about erroll babbage gere who works for the department of safety and is preparing to retire his office thrusts upon him his replacement allison lowry claire danes stardust who quickly discovers that babbage is obsessed with his job and that job ain't very fun he monitors hundreds of sexual offenders who are on parole in his jurisdiction allison goes with erroll on many calls to check up on his flock of offenders and learns that he is in desperate need of retirement but erroll is good at his job even if his methods aren't he taunts sexual predators and even has physical conflicts with them erroll justifies his actions by bringing up these deviants' pasts it is this good justification that challenges the audience on some level letting us see how brutal erroll is and yet how out of touch he's become by being too close to his job br br when a teenage girl goes missing in erroll's area he immediate leaps to the conclusion that she was abducted by one of his flock but how could he know is erroll that good at his job allison challenges him and erroll pushes back their battles become as fierce as erroll's need to find this missing girl br br although the set up for the story was okay it didn't have any umpf i will give credit to richard gere however who plays the erroll character very well battling retirement worried about everyone who's near his flock disgusted with those he's responsible for overseeing disgusted with himself for having to do some of things he does quite a change in character portrayal for gere but beyond him there's not much else some of the sets are okay dark and dangerous but there are so many other problems as to be laughable br br i'll be the first to admit that suspending disbelief is a requirement whenever watching films but that suspension has limits the biggest push against those limits is the destruction of extremely vital crime scenes someone as meticulous as erroll would know that moving a body would be a huge no no or trampling through a crime scene or moving evidence it went beyond and hurt the film to no end br br the other damaging part of this film is that we never get into clair danes' character allison she's almost dropped by the wayside at the end of the film and we're never privy to what her intension might be will she stay or leave will she end up like erroll if she does stay this isn't a horrible film as it does touch on some uncomfortable moral ground but the story as a whole needed to be tightened up
bruce almighty is the story of bruce nolan an average man who feels god is messing up his life god confronts him and show bruce the error of his ways of course giving someone god's powers could take a turn for the worse bruce almighty is a good comedy jim carrey is good as always morgan freeman is first rate and seems right at home as god and the cast brings the plot together well the jokes are almost always on target although sometimes they resort a bit too much on carrey's facial expressions i liked the fact that the movie actually portrayed god not only that but also as a black man i thought this quite well especially with the brilliant freeman there are some hilarious scenes the opening cookie scene for instance others miss the target slightly but still a good film 6 7 out of 10
this movie was on the romance channel and i thought it might be a goofy 80's movie that would be enjoyable on some level so my brother and i watched it boy did it suck boy gets crush on girl correction his dream girl apparently there is a difference and i'm surprised he realized she was his dream girl he was smitten with her from over 30 feet away i guess that just goes to show the power of dream girls boy ends up masquerading as a female to be near dream girl creative in the sense that it's a far out plan but un creative in the sense that there are probably better solutions one might think up awkward situations ensue a match is made all of which takes seems to take place around late afternoon either the location was somehow responsible for this odd lighting or the actors had to wait until they got off of their day jobs to come to the set i suspect the latter very clumsily done very pathetic it's almost never even amusing accidentally so there really is nothing to redeem it unless you're interested in seeing chad lowe's early days before he finally got his piece of the pie with his role as the hiv positive gay guy on the series life goes on or gail o'grady who was on nypd blue and probably got to stare at dennis franz's buttocks but those are unlikely motives i'd say systematic derangement of the senses would be a more justified purpose i'm surprised i watched it all i guess it's the kind of thing where halfway through you find yourself still watching due to some morbid self flagellistic inner issue and think you might as well finish it so you can tell your friends and family that you actually sat through such a horrible movie on the off chance that it'll garner you some sympathy for the questionable state of your mental health can you take the challenge
for starters it's a very funny movie with a few crazy characters running around that are bound to make laugh check out the two russian bugs br br a bug's life has a classical disney storyline but that's one of the good things about the movie family values are praised and the main characters of the film undergo some evolution in order to stand up against the grasshoppers in the end and it also has a couple of great voice overs by dave foley julia louise dreyfus kevin spacey of course but actually the most amazing thing about this movie is the animation it's just wonderful all the details great colors every ant looks different beautiful backgrounds and the guys and girls at pixar made it all look so realistic all in all a very nice piece of work this is the best animation by disney since aladdin
you just got to love opening sequences like the one in seven women for satan  during the intro there's a naked girl running through the woods chased by a hunting dog and a malignant looking dude on a horse until she falls off a cliff and splits her head open on a rock then the camera zooms out on the face of the guy and we notice how he's simply sitting behind a desk whilst his secretary waiting for him to sign some papers oh i'm sorry i was lost in my thoughts he then says sweet i have stumbled upon yet another completely bonkers movie even if you only understand a minimum of french and have a look at the original title you immediately know that seven women for satan hasn't got anything to do with satan or ritual sacrifices but simply revolves on the flamboyant escapades of a perverted and mentally unstable count during his weekend in the countryside this is in fact another sleazy variation on the classic milestone the most dangerous game about a lunatic's disturbing hobby of hunting people  preferably hot naked chicks in the forest for sports well actually this is more than just a variation on the 1932 classic as writer director actor michel lemoine had the pretension to directly link his protagonist to leslie banks' legendary villain in the most dangerous game count zaroff supposedly is the original count zaroff's son but he exchanged his private island for the remote french countryside he also can't afford to be unemployed anymore so he's an office clerk from monday to friday and a maniacal killer during the weekend zaroff is a genuine weirdo who hallucinates about dancing with deceased woman but actually runs his car over the live ones his butler once pledged to prevent the zaroffs from killing but he's obviously doing a lousy job there isn't any depth in the screenplay and the build up certainly doesn't pay attention to suspense or sinister atmosphere really the only useful thing to do during this film is count the girls that are lured for zaroff's deceptive trap and hope they'll reach seven rapidly half of the film is pointless and tedious padding footage like the overlong erotic dance act in which a statue inexplicably transforms into a muscular black guy and the other half exists of psychedelic sleaze that eventually grows tiresome as well even though all the girls look ravishing i have the impression that it was michel lemoine's intention to imitate his pal jean rollin and make a deliriously kinky sex thriller seven women for satan is a french production so inevitably it also stars jess franco regular howard vernon the awful dr orloff zombie lake lemoine himself surely has the looks of a crazy killer but not the talent to depict one
drew barrymore keeps seeing her alter ego all over town and it's really starting to become a pain in the butt br br after dee rents a flat from a hack writer her encounters with 'the other drew' become more frequent writer dude feels that it's his responsibility to snap 'the real drew' out of her stupor so he does what he can to help including seducing her as soon as he has some free time not very interesting and even less scary but drew is sexy as usual especially when she gives a group of rude construction workers the finger yeah drew that's hot br br best scene just might be where drew stabs her real life mom jaid with a big kitchen knife hmmm and how was your day
the only way this is a family drama is if parents explain everything wrong with its message br br spoiler they feed a deer for a year and then kill it for eating their food after killing its mother and at first pontificating about taking responsibility for their actions they blame bears and deer for misbehaving by eating while they take no responsibility to use adequate locks and fences or even learn to shoot instead of twice maiming animals and letting them linger
dumb is as dumb does in this thoroughly uninteresting supposed black comedy essentially what starts out as chris klein trying to maintain a low profile eventually morphs into an uninspired version of the three amigos only without any laughs in order for black comedy to work it must be outrageous which play dead is not in order for black comedy to work it cannot be mean spirited which play dead is what play dead really is is a town full of nut jobs fred dunst does however do a pretty fair imitation of billy bob thornton's character from a simple plan while jake busey does a pretty fair imitation of well jake busey merk
at a time in our culture where reality exposed as narrative is overpowering fiction as we know it on the small and big screen apart from that is a film that exposes real life moments that feel more honest fresh and innovative in there presentation than i have ever seen before the usual spoon feeding conventions are non existent in this film leaving a content audience to sit and watch these real life moments trickle one after the other on the screen while watching the movie and even upon post contemplation it is hard to believe that these amazing performances where actually that performances every moment with the large cast of actors felt like the truth being exposed in their daily usual lives even so apart from that does not feel like a documentary or reality television but instead transcends into a category of its own with its unique cinematography and direction i look forward to watching this new category of storytelling continue with other films by directors jennifer shainin and randy walker br br this movie must be seen
whoever thought that another home alone film would be a good idea should have their head examined same plot different kid more villains which leads to more endless stupidity in the traps the other two films were bad enough and this is where it hits rock bottom people may as well watch the other films for plot as it's all identical
i bought unhinged because i got suckered by the gory picture on the cover if you want to see all the good parts of the movie just look on the back of the box all the kills are shown and i can honestly tell you that they look much better in the still frames than they do in the movie br br having said that let's look at the plot a group of college girls driving to a rock concert by way of the deep dark woods in one of the longest driving sequences ever captured on celluloid slide off the road no visible damage is done to the car but apparently it was enough to put one of the characters in a comatose state for the rest of the film or perhaps she read the script and was already in a coma before filming began br br the two remaining girls wake up in a big isolated house the house by the way is fabulous and manages more drama just by its presence than any of the actors in the film for some reason though this house has no roads going to it the only way you can get to the main road is by hiking five miles through the woods the girls spend the rest of unhinged sitting around listening to weird conversations between an old rich bitch who looks like george washington in drag and her equally homely sexually repressed daughter the girls apparently were in no hurry to get back from that concert anyway being that they packed more clothes than the cast of gilligan's island for that three hour tour br br by the time we the viewers get to the kill scenes we no longer care we wish that someone would kill us just to end our suffering unhinged finally wraps up with a quite shocking ending that deserved to be in a much better film it's almost as though the ending the one good idea in the film was written first and then the writers tried to make a movie leading up to it br br unhinged is ultimately a boring film with bad acting inept directing and a plot with more holes than a leper in a porno film sorry i'm not sure where that came from you will get an idea of how bad this movie is during the opening credits when for some reason that is never explained the screen goes black for about two minutes while the characters talk about nothing worth remembering don't waste your time you'll just feel unhinged and want your time and money back
i didn't really like this movie that much at all it wasn't really funny and in some cases it was just downright stupid rob schneider is definitely one enormously talented individual and while his acting was fine in this it just seemed like a real waste for him to star in i mean there were some parts that were okay and somewhat humorous in a cute kind of way but that's about it the only thing that actually caught my attention during this whole ordeal of over the top jokes was that there were some very good looking females present and i'm not one to watch a movie solely because of that but in this case it was the only nook where even the slightest case of redemption could be found all in all it was a couple notches below an average movie br br final query br br theaters so glad i didn't squander too much money on this br br dvd purchase ummm let me think no br br rental if you have a prehistoric sense of humor then why not
the story is similar to et an extraterrestrial run around on earth and tries to come back home while its stay on our planet it will create friendly ties with humans br br but unlike et which exudes drama comedy poetry this movie is only fun it is indeed a pure dysney production its core audience are children the movie is more more in the visual than in the message br br thus you will find some funny scenes the first sighting of the town a cosmic stray toaster and the casting is experimented with special mentions to doc who rejuvenates in a mac fly character and to hurley who seems open to auto derision br br ice on the cake the main title is scored by danny elfman and like every other great composer you recognize his voice before he is even credited
in case half of this film's footage looks strangely familiar it means you watch way too much of this gory italian cult crap for you see the notorious demigod lucio fulci did not only produce this movie he also took the liberty of re using the most sadistic killing sequences in his own and more easily traceable cat in the brain the opening scene already in which a prostitute is brutally decapitated with an axe features in fulci's later film and so do another handful of killings and sleaze moments andrea bianchi's masssacre fails miserably as a giallo since the search for the sadistic killer among a movie crew shooting a horror movie is all but compelling and suspenseful but it's still good entertainment if you're into cheap 'n shlocky horror trash the incoherent script introduces a whole bunch of repugnant characters who're all potential maniacs but none of the red herrings biachi comes up with are plausible and you can point out the killer almost immediately whatever remains to enjoy are the truly misogynous make up effects and the hilariously awful acting performances of the ensemble cast whenever there isn't any bloodshed on screen like between the first and second murder massacre is a slow and almost intolerable with its inane dialogs and thoroughly unexciting photography thankfully in the second half there are women getting impaled on fences and males being stabbed repeatedly with rusty spikes the music is crap and the use of filming locations is very unimaginative my advise would be to skip this puppy and go straight for the aforementioned cat in the brain that one features all the great moments of massacre and then some
this is the worst movie i ever paid to see and with the exception of they saved hitler's brain the worst movie i have ever seen period when this movie came out i was a big fan of snl and sctv and therefore was anticipating what i thought would be the funniest movie that could be produced since it did not have the restrictions the tv improv shows must deal with br br the writers must have thought we will throw in some grossness some flatulence jokes some cheap sex and hey we have a risky side splitting laughable comedy the game show skits are nothing more than cheap unimaginable take offs on let's make a deal with stupid grossness the sit com take off involving the single girl and her boyfriend was just plain bad high school humor the stun gun advertisement was suitable humor for seasame street the la subway skit was bland humor using tasteless bloodiness the french chef walking around blind constantly uttering there is no difference with a french accent was well you get my point br br the only funny skit involved chevy chase which lasted for a whole minute this means you get 60 seconds of entertainment in this movie oh yea i've read the comments about the entire country being stoned in the 1970's and you will like this movie if you are high well most of the country was not stoned in the 70's if the inept writers were stoned it must have been on drowsy sinus medicine there were 4 other people in the theater besides myself when i saw this movie of course word did not get out yet about how bad the movie was
i felt like i was watching the fast and the furious again but with different actors and a little bit different plot i will say the cars in the film are very cool so if you like fast cars then you will probably find this movie mildly entertaining i also liked nadia bjorlin because i've seen her from days of our lives she is a really good singer but too bad they gave her such lousy songs to sing in this movie i mean songs about cars not exactly what you would here on the radio since it is a hollywood film you have to give this story a little lee way but in real life i don't think any average joe would come across such a hot girl as nadia bjorlin who can drive a race car fix a car engine and be a lead singer it's just all very silly br br another side note any one willing to wager 25 million on a car race is a nut but it was kinda of cool at the end when natasha stops right before the finish line and screws michael over priceless br br final verdict this movie is for car freaks so if you like fast cars then i'd recommend this
i have just recently been through a stage where i wanted to see why it is that horror films of the 90's can't hold a candle to 70's and 80's horror films i have been very public in this forum about the vileness of films like the haunting and urban legend and such i feel that they and others like them don't know what true horror is and it bothered me to the point where it made me go to my local video store and rent some of the classic horror films i already own all the friday's so i rented the texas chainsaw massacre the original nightmare on elm street jaws the exorcist angel heart the exorcist and halloween now the other films are classics in their own right but it is here that i want to tell you about halloween because what halloween does is perhaps something no other film in the history of horror film can do and that is it uses subtle techniques techniques that don't rely on blood and gore and it uses these to scare the living daylights out of you i was in a room by myself with the lights off and as silly as i knew it was i wanted to look behind me to see if michael myers was there no movie that i have seen in the last ten years has done that to me no movie br br john carpenter took a low budget film and he scared a generation of movie goers he showed that you don't need budgets in the 8 or 9 figures to evoke fear on an audience because sometimes the best element of fear is not what actually happens but what is about to happen what was that shadow what was that noise upstairs he knows that these are the ways to scare someone and he uses every element of textbook horror that i think you can use i even think he made up some of his own ideas and these should be ideas that people use today but they don't no one uses lighting and detail to provoke scares they use special effects and rivers of blood and it is just not the same you can't be scared by a giant special effect that makes loud noises and jumps out of a wall it's the moments when the killer is lurking somewhere you just don't know where that scare you and halloween succeeds like no other film in this endeavor br br in 1963 a young micael myers kills his sister with a large butcher knife and then spends the next 15 years of his life silently locked up in an institute as loomis his doctor says to sheriff brackett i spent eight years trying to reach him and then another seven making sure that he never gets out because what i saw behind those eyes was pure e vil that sets up the manic and relentless idea of a killer that will stop at nothing to get what he wants and all he wants here is to kill laurie no one know why he wants to kill her but he does halloween ii continues the story quite well br br what carpenter has done here is taken a haunting score mendacious lighting techniques and wrote and directed a tightly paced masterpiece of horror there is one scene that has to be described and that is the scene where annie is on her way to pick up paul she goes to the car and tries to open it only then does she realize that she has left her keys in the house she gets them comes back out and inadvertently opens the car door without using the keys the audience picks up on this but she doesn't she is too busy thinking about paul when she sits down she notices that the windows are fogged up she is puzzled and starts to wipe away the mist and then myers strikes from the back seat this is such a great scene because it pays attention to detail we know what is happening and annie doesn't but it's astute observations that carpenter made that scared the hell out of movie goers in 1978 and beyond br br halloween uses blurry images of a killer standing in the background it has shadows ominously gliding across a wall dark rooms creepy and haunting music a sinister story told hauntingly by donald pleasance and a menacing relentless killer my advice to film makers in our day and age is to study halloween it should be the blue print for what scary movies are all about after all carpenter followed in hitchcock's steps maybe director's should follow in his br br halloween personifies everything that scares us if you are tired of all the mindless horror films that don't know the difference between evil and cuteness then halloween is a film that should be seen it won't let you down i enjoy being scared i don't know why but i do but nothing has scared me in the 90's except maybe one film wes craven's final nightmare if you enjoy beings scared then halloween is one that you should see and if you have already seen it a hundred times go and watch it again back to back with a film like urban legend urban legend will have you enticed at all the pretty faces in the movie halloween will have you frozen with fear stuck in your seat not wanting to move now tell me what horror film would you rather watch br br and just to follow up after seeing zombie's version it makes you appreciate this that much more this is a classic by definition zombie bastardized his version but it doesn't take away from the brilliance of this one
a sharp political comment posturing as a coming of age story is what this movie is the annoying thing is that it works effectively on both levels it isn't supposed to but it does this tale of four boys and a girl growing up in 1953 communist belgrade is a heart warmer it is what gentlemen refer to as classic cinema obviously 1953 belgrade is not as harsh a dictatorial and fascist environment as the communist society is often portrayed one can listen to rock and roll music one of the songs played is the song hey babu riba ala the title of the movie but jeans cannot be bought nor certain drugs which are illegal to possess unlike a heavy handed criticism of a communist society this movie does it by showing how it affects the lives of the five protagonists who refer to themselves as we four the girl who has a father in exile in italy and is awaiting a passport for her mother and she to travel out to join him the piano that is taken away from communion use from one of the boys the sudden giving of your home and quarters to your new comrades because they need it the boys spend a lot of time listening to music and it is made clear they despise the fascism that communism has created as they engage in tiffs with a fascist charlatan who has stalin tattooed on his hands these all leads to the actions they take later on and the remembrance of a time fading away as this movie was released in 1986 in the twilight of the soviet empire a great movie worth seeing again and again repentance is not your enemy but yet it is also nobody's friend
when a friend gave me a boxed set of 12 amazing scifi horror movies i was understandably a little cautious but since the item was a gift i really didn't truly pay my common sense much heed after all movies for free so what if they are a little ropey after much consideration alien intruder was the first of those movies ironically it was first choice because it looked the best of the bunch all i can say is if this is the best of them i shudder to think what the rest are like br br on the surface it had some good things going for it four count 'em actors that i was familiar with billy dee williams tracy scoggins maxwell caulfield and jeff conaway i told myself billy and tracy have been in some good scifi star wars and babylon 5 respectively so they wouldn't sign up for a turkey max is a veteran soap actor who never really managed to break into film but not too shoddy an actor an jeff well he's done the good and the bad as far as films and tv go i was soon to discover that jeff had decided to add the ugly to his repertoire of movies br br the first clue was in the opening scenes jeff mugs his way with gusto through an i'm mad scene before finally killing himself an amusing cameo performance really unfortunately this is without much exaggeration the highlight of the film it goes downhill from there br br next up we have the commander of the mission williams who is being sent out to see what happened to jeff and his crew busy picking his new shipmates from among the ranks of the criminal element but this assortment aren't so much the dirty dozen more like the unconvincing foursome plus one of the crims a computer hacker is shown in his cell working away on a laptop computer isn't that a bit like letting a murderer run a gun shop in the slammer pretty lame prison if you ask me br br when they finally take off the effects are truly horrible it looks like the spaceship model was knocked up in an afternoon by some bored 8 year old who had parts left over from his airfix kits br br but the horror doesn't stop there whilst on route to the area where jeff's ship vanished the criminal crew are rewarded for their good behaviour by being given weekends of virtual reality in which they indulge their male fantasies all well and good and the use of scenes from their fantasies serves as an introduction to the alien menace which begins to appear there but did they have to drag it out for quite sooooo loooooong alien intruder alien boring more like br br finally they make it to g sector and the alien presence makes them fight against each other for her affections until only good old max is left the ending in truly optimistic rubbish film vein hints at a sequel as if also making an appearance in this movie is a character i'll nickname the sweatdroid he's supposed to be an android but apparently that fact was lost on the make up crew who provided him with sweaty features at any opportunity but don't worry he's just there to make up the body count numbers at the end br br williams and scoggins to be truthful do very little in the film they only just barely stay awake let alone act and as i mentioned earlier jeff gets an early trip to the showers so his manicness isn't allowed to enlighten much of the film max tries his best as do a couple of the other cast members but the movie is just direly atrocious to be honest br br the one and only half way imaginative thing this movie offers is the ship naming convention they are all named after musicians holly presley joplin the rest of the film is bland and uninspired br br made in 1992 i had thought on initial viewing it was one of those 80's straight to video jobs looks like they still made crap movies well into the 90's it seems br br it's best avoided even as a beer n chips movie this film is a stinker but at least you can fast forward it i suppose
watching that lady in ermine i was wondering what betty grable was doing in a project that seemed to be aimed for marlene dietrich to do someone over at 20th century fox may have decided one sex symbol is as good as another darryl f zanuck should have known better br br betty plays a 19th century italian countess whose domain has been invaded by a troop of hungarian hussars captained by douglas fairbanks jr her ghostly ancestor whose portrait hangs in the palace hall along with the rest of her distinguished family tree sees no small resemblance in doug now and another invader some 300 years earlier whom she dealt with when armies failed br br besides that the current betty has just been married to cesar romero and the invasion has come at a most inopportune moment before things have been consummated that's going to give anyone a bad attitude i guarantee br br fresh wholesome all american betty is not the actress to do seductive and mysterious marlene dietrich might have put this over but with betty it falls flatter than yesterday's presidential candidate she and fairbanks have no chemistry at all though doug is as charming as ever and someone i can watch in anything br br frederick hollander and leo robin wrote the score for this film and this is the moment got an oscar nomination for best song that lady in ermine's one chance for oscar glory fell to buttons and bows br br ernest lubitsch died midway during the film and otto preminger finished that lady in ermine i can't believe lubitsch had grable in mind for the lead here neither will you if you see that lady in ermine

spoilers ahead but does it really matter have you ever read a movie review composed entirely of questions could this be it why did an ancient civilization bury artifacts all over the world why is this question never answered why was the opening text crawl incoherent why would a nun she sure seemed nice hand over 20 orphans to a madman has there always been a gold mine in downtown vancouver why does one of the gold mine's shafts exit in the front yard of an orphanage why does tara reid's character suddenly show up at christian slater's apartment for sex or did i just answer my own question why would even a non archaeologist bang open an obviously valuable solid gold chest with a sledgehammer why would modern computers still display green pre tron era grid outlines of objects complete with little bleeps and must all movie explosive timers have digital displays why doesn't anything in this movie make any sense
terrible acting by potter and a flat plot with no tension what so ever and as for the feminist polemic it's laughable i saw this garbage when it was first released and though i found it tedious beyond belief i'm glad i did go to see it that's because i now have an immediate answer to the question 'what's the worst film you've ever seen ' plus i have the comfort of knowing that every film i see for the rest of my life will be better than the tango lesson but i have to admit i was impressed with the way potter wrote a script that would garner the maximum number of arts council grants from around the world as is revealed in the closing credits br br i only very recently saw orlando and i can see how potter learnt the wrong lessons from making that film all it took was a bunch of frilly costumes a few hard stares to camera by the leading lady and a loose plot to seduce the cinema going public so why shouldn't she think she could get away with the self indulgent nothingness that is the tango lesson

this is a great movie some will disagree with me but if you know anything about the bible you know it is i think everyone should see it i agree a new updated version like be nice but the message is still right on if you can see this movie is not a scare the hell of you movie it is truthful with the bible i think the u n will play a major role in the world government to come the last days are lining up with the bible look at what has happened with the chip for dogs and cats that now has come to light to protect on children from being kidnapped it's the size of a grain of rice this i feel is the fore runner of the mark of the beast spoken of in the bible without the mark you can't sell or buy with this chip that small in the future there is no telling how much info can be put on it
i have personally seen many disney movies in my lifetime though absolutely none of them match up in any way to bedknobs and broomsticks although i personally wouldn't have crossed live action with animation it was an improvement on trying to dress people up as animation characters the movie pits three evacuees from world war two who are sent to stay with a silent and socially awkward woman in the country i would have to say that the casting was brilliant angela landsbury made a perfect miss price while david thomilson made a great desperate entertainer love interest endings always surprise me and this was no exception it was neither happy nor sad though i do not know if this was intentional the dialog wasn't great but considering it was designed to be a kid's movie that is alright overall i would give the performance nine out of ten the dialog six out of ten the casting nine out of ten and the costumes eight out of ten
i'm still trying to decide if this is indeed the worst film i have ever seen a very disturbing problem with this film is that real scientists are interviewed but their footage is edited to make it look as though they support the ideas of the many bsers who populate this film the bs to signal ratio of the interviews is about ten thousand to one at the end the interviewees seem to be saying we want you to think but they themselves are too lazy to do simple research about things they assert as fact br br if you feel that you are open minded and wish to expand your consciousness please be open minded enough to read some actual books about quantum theory einstein's universe nigel calder a slim volume not a challenge the cosmic code by heinz pagels if you can't bring yourself to read a book please don't complain to reviewers about being open minded br br to recap this film is just unbelievably bad br br you know what's a really good film which questions the nature of reality thirteenth floor directed by roland emmerich with craig bierko gretchen mol vincent d'onofrio smart sexy thought provoking
this film is just another distortion among many distortions on the so called 'sins of consumerism' please note that 'reverend billy' an actor bill talen is nothing more than a bureaucrat against the 'sins of consumerism' we might want to ask are questions like what does 'reverend billy' do for a living how does he make his money does he make his living off his 'tax deductible' organization how does the internal revenue justify this as a 'tax deductible' church or organization br br everyone knows that christmas is commercialized but it affords one day out of a whole year in which people have an opportunity to be charitable and allows a significant number of people to spend time with their families friends or extended families everyone is not charitable everyone does not spend time with their families friends or extended families but holidays and vacation time give people that chance and opportunity yes america does have more than its share of problems but with perseverance americans have and always make it through great difficulties and even in times of strife america has proved itself to be the greatest country in the world that happens when americans pull together and unite rather than to separate and divide yes there are problems with corporations and monopolies but it will take americans to bring back the small businesses along with the ethics to responsibly care for people living in our individual communities yes globalization has brought us its share of problems but it will take americans to bring production back to america americans and the u s government need to learn how to stay on a budget no matter how large or small it may be and we must stop our dependence on credit our over reliance on credit will make and keep us poor from the cradle to the grave it is important to buy but if we buy less we will rely less on credit and if we are able to save even a small amount of money we will have money for a rainy day not to say that as americans we will gain an equal share of wealth wealth is not guaranteed and has never been guaranteed but stratification teaches us that only a small percentage of americans hold most of america's wealth there is a good proximity that you or i can reach the level of the upper middle class and who knows what can happen from there be positive work hard and at the very least you and i will be able to reach at least some if not all of our dreams in life nothing is guaranteed but we always have that something to reach for and if you or i don't have dreams we might as well be dead in america there is always room for plenty of hopes and dreams as individuals we are a part of the pack but we always can become the leader of the pack br br it has always been my experience that churches and religion do offer nothing more than additional distortions but i pay dignity and give respect to people with other beliefs values and perspectives but as far as the distortions expressed within this film i do not have any faith in such beliefs values and perspectives i rank this film with a 1 out of 10 but in all honesty and truth this film deserves a zero this film has no integrity and i cannot recommend it
dreamgirls despite its fistful of tony wins in an incredibly weak year on broadway has never been what one would call a jewel in the crown of stage musicals however that is not to say that in the right cinematic hands it could not be fleshed out and polished into something worthwhile on screen unfortunately what transfers to the screen is basically a slavishly faithful version of the stage hit with all of its inherent weaknesses intact first the score has never been one of the strong points of this production and the film does not change that factor there are lots of songs perhaps too many but few of them are especially memorable the closest any come to catchy tunes are the title song and one night only the much acclaimed and i am telling you that i am not going is less a great song than it is a dramatic set piece for the character of effie jennifer hudson the film is slick and technically well produced but the story and characters are surprisingly thin and lacking in any resonance there is some interest in the opening moments watching jamie foxx's svengali like manager manipulate his acts to the top but that takes a back seat in the latter portion of the film when the story conveniently tries to cast him as a villain despite his having been right from a business stand point for a good majority of the film beyonce knowles is lovely and sings her songs perfectly well but is stuck with a character who is basically all surface glitz anika noni rose as the third member of the dreamgirls trio literally has nothing to do for the entire film eddie murphy acquits himself well as a singer obviously based on james brown but the role is not especially meaty and ultimately has little impact foxx would seem ideal casting but he seems oddly withdrawn and bored the film's biggest selling point is surely former american idol contestant oscar winner jennifer hudson in the central role of effie white the temperamental singer who gets booted from the group and makes a triumphant closing act return for me effie has always been a big problem in both the show and the movie the film obviously wants you to feel sorry for her and rather ham handedly takes her side but i have never been sure that this character deserves that kind of devotion from the start effie conducts herself for the most part like an obnoxious egotistical self centered diva who is more interested in what everyone else can do for her rather than having much vested interest in the group of which she is a part when she is booted from the group for her unprofessionalism and bad attitude the charges are more than well founded but the stage show film seem to think effie should be cut unlimited slack simply because she has a great voice even though the film tries to soften some of effie's harder edges to make her more likable the charges still stand her story becomes more manipulative by suggesting she should have our further sympathy because she is an unwed mother struggling to raise her daughter using the implication that much like the talent card motherhood immediately makes any behavior excusable indeed the only big effort the film makes to show effie's mothering is to tell us about it and then include a scene where she barks at her daughter in the unemployment office insists that the girl has no father and then refuse to look for gainful employment to support them since singing is all she knows in the hands of a skillful actress the gaps could perhaps have been remedied with technique and charisma unfortunately hudson is not that actress she sings well but the dialog driven moments do not come naturally to her nor do high emotional moments effie's signature moment the aforementioned and i am telling you number is well sung by hudson but emotionally flat in the acting department effie is supposed to expressing her rage and desperation at her predicament but hudson comes off as a cabaret performer belting out a hot number all in all not quite the emotional highlight one expects the latter portion of the film is basically a predictable melange of events that maneuver foxx into hudson's earlier position and allow her to strut back in and lord it over everyone foxx's criminal offenses in the film are undoubtedly par for the course of many struggling record producers but the film's seeming implication that he has it coming because he helped usher in the disco era is rather ridiculous not to mention pretentious and condescending particularly coming from a film with all of the depth of a puddle the end result is a faithful rendition of the stage hit drained of emotion energy or anything that can be described as dynamic
okay i absolutely love ben stiller although i am lukewarm about jennifer aniston i do not think this girl can act in the least every movie or sitcom i've seen her in is very hard to get past her fake acting it sounds like she is just standing there reading right off the script this movie only had one good thing about it and that's that ben stiller was in it this plot is so used and abused it's ridiculous how many movies have this same type of plot can we say forces of nature not only is the plot so old but the outcome is so predictable it's boring i knew everything that was going to happen before it did it was a bore but watching stiller is always a delight
a couple move into their dream home unaware that it and its neighbours have been built over land formerly used as a cemetery the film is said to have been based on a true story although how much of it is supposed to be true is not disclosed the plot is hardly unique see spielberg's 'poltergeist' 1982 within a short time they experience various supernatural phenomena these range from the disturbing mysterious shadows the serious illness of the daughter to the frankly ridiculous toilets continually flushing and garage doors going out of control there is little depth to the story once it has become established that the land had been used as a cemetery we do not learn anything more the plot does not seem to develop the characters are not particularly well drawn or in any way memorable nor is the atmosphere particularly special the film could be disturbing to some viewers there is no sense of catharsis or any kind of positive message from it
the only thing i knew about this film prior to seeing it was robby the robot my preconception was that it was another in a long line of cheesy sci fi flicks that the 1950's was noted for how wrong i was big studio big budget and big production values make this a strong contender at least visually for the best sci fi film coming out of the era i qualify with the word visually because war of the worlds is a lot darker and scarier than forbidden planet and probably fits the mold better as a foray into alien territory br br what impressed me immediately was the color rendition of the cinematography followed by the intricacy and scope of detail involved in dr morbius' walter pidgeon home and laboratory but that was only the prelude to the icing on the cake the labyrinthine underground that served as the krell stronghold it appeared that krell technology was even more advanced than say that of star wars which made me consider audiences for this movie back when it was released probably sat in the same kind of awe that theater goers experienced in 1977 with sw or in 1986 with aliens watching it on a large screen tv in my living room offered me the same effect and i'm fairly resistant to hyperbole br br it's not too much of a stretch to imagine forbidden planet as a direct antecedent of the 'star trek' tv series gene roddenberry himself stated that the movie had a great impact on his vision for the show followers of that short lived series will readily recognize plot elements used here that turned up in 'star trek' i had to do a double take when the men of united planets cruiser c57 v headed for a transporter room while the conundrum presented to robby that created an impossibility to respond was an element used at least two or three times in the st series br br where the movie definitely took a cerebral turn had to do with the whole idea of 'monsters from the id' that morbius himself was using his subconscious mind to defend altaire iv was certainly a unique concept for 1956 when every other sci fi flick of the time was dealing with martians or other grotesque space creatures the film worked it's subtle magic on this viewer by helping me understand that morbius was the protector of altaire iv some time before commander adams leslie nielsen explained it br br you know looking at the calendar the year 2200 isn't that far off this movie may be the one that actually gets it right relative to exploring and living on other planets i think though that they'll have to come up with a sleeker looking version of robby
possible spoiler br br 'return to cabin by the lake' is a useless movie the acting was not good and the plot wasn't even remotely interesting br br 'cabin by the lake' is a good tv movie the sequel was not judd nelson was very good in the first film and put a whole lot more into his character than in this it seemed as if he wasn't even interested in doing the sequel his acting was good but it could have been better i really don't want to comment on the rest of the cast because in my opinion they're not even worth mentioning but i'll do it the character of alison isn't even hardly shown in the first part of the film all of a sudden she's the center of attention next to stanley caldwell the role didn't make sense and it should have been thought out a little better dahlia salem was absolutely terrible her acting was way below decent and the casting people should have looked for somebody else anybody else the director mike was a confusing character he seemed to have a purpose for being there but it didn't seem like his death was necessary the acting for this role was good nothing great but better than salem's br br the plot was real lousy if you think about it stanley who is presumed dead makes his way onto the set of 'cabin by the lake' the movie based on his script he stumbles upon the director and in a short time the director is dead and stanley is running the show yeah out of nowhere the crew is just going to let this stranger come into the picture and finish the film not knowing anything about him there's some killings not a whole lot and the one's that are shown are ridiculous one of the actresses on the set gets electrocuted while filming a scene another character gets chewed up by a motorboat and one gets tangled up in a plant before drowning these writers must have been hard up for excitement br br i just have to say that i was not impressed with the filming of the movie the way that it kept changing from looking low budget back to normal started to become irritating very fast also the new cabin by the lake was poorly created we aren't shown it but only in a few scenes and the whole thing with the chain in the basement was useless it worked in the first film only because we were shown the room a lot more but it didn't work in this one br br there were too many characters in this sequel all of them except for a few had no reason to be there the acting of what little is showed was really bad and they just didn't have a purpose in this movie br br all in all 'return to cabin by the lake' is a sequel picking up from where the first left off 'cabin by the lake' i can take but this was just not impressive judd nelson should have avoided this one and so should you it's nothing like the first and it went entirely too slow nothing happened in the first hour and it continued to drag on for the second not to mention that the writing was horrible put this on only if you need some help getting to sleep br br so we see that stanley defies death and is still alive and well by the way he talks it sounds like there could be a possible third installment to a movie good just by itself quit throwing in sequels and we may be alright br br did the film makers not realize that they showed us how they filmed the lake scenes from the first one they were all done in a tank never never reveal the secrets of filming br br
i can't even believe that this show lasted as long as it did i guess it's all part of the dumbing down of america personally like david spade said i liked this show better when it went by its original title seinfeld what bothers me the most about this show aside from the obvious base sense of humor and general smuttiness is the pretentious way the episodes are titled truly great shows are still funny after many repeated viewings like the one where rob gets accidentally hypnotized on the dick van dyke show or the one where lucy and ethel work at the candy factory in other words it's an honor bestowed upon great programs by the viewers that the writers and producers of friends would have the unmitigated hubris to actually title the episodes themselves in such a fashion before anyone's even had a chance to even see it a second time speaks to not only the mediocrity and lack of original thinking on the part of said writers but also of the stultified minds of their viewers br br you read the comments of some of these people and can only come to the conclusion that they live in a hallmark card like neverland full of greeting card sentiment the true meaning of friendship i want to be a friend i want to live in manhattan wake up these people are supposed to be working in coffee shops and looking for work as actors but they somehow manage to live in 4000 mo apartments get real all i have to say to those amongst us that want to move to manhattan and live the idyllic new york life with your rosses and monicas good luck with all of that that new york doesn't exist for anyone making less than a serious six figure income but good luck with all of that anyway now shut up and pass the soma
i am not going to lie despite looking interesting i watched the notorious bettie page because i had heard and it was fairly obvious just by looking at a synopsis or anything about the film that gretchen mol got naked in it i have never been a fan of mol but i cannot resist seeing an attractive woman taking off her clothes yes that may be perverted but its a theme and ideal central to the very core of the movie and helps to make the film a lot stronger than it probably should be br br the film chronicles bettie page's mol life from her physical and sexually abused days as a kid in high school in the south and onto her new life in new york she wants to be an actress but she has to pay bills too after taking a few seemingly innocent shots on a local beach page slowly becomes a modeling sensation and quickly jumps from suggestive photos to sexually provocative pin up photographs br br i feel the briefness of the film just over ninety minutes is both a curse and blessing for it on one hand the film never overstays its welcome you get to know page within a few short minutes and then it gets right into her modeling career and does not look back but it curses the film as well because we never really get a chance to grasp everything that is going on she just kind of jumps around between modeling shoots and the controversies that they create before jumping right into the major senate investigation that takes up much of the final act of the film you just sit there and attempt to absorb it all and more just comes right at you it feels like the filmmakers wanted to summarize too much material in too short a film it begs for longer sequences and begs more for even longer explanations it does not feel rushed it just does not feel all there br br another bit of a fumble although a bit more of a curiosity is the use of colour throughout the film the majority is in black and white but frequently splashes and sequences of colour do emerge but while this may have been done as a symbolic gesture early on it becomes a bit of a distraction as it continually pops up later on before cutting back to black and white it gets confusing and becomes more of a tedious interference than anything else as the film goes on br br while it may fumble a bit with the actions the film stays dead on with its themes page who i know little to nothing about is played off innocently and her world is exactly the same save for a few shady characters during her teenage years everyone she encounters is an innocent and everything she does has an innocence to it i never thought i would look at full frontal nudity as being something that was anything other than vulgar and depraved but here it truly is something to marvel at all at once it is beautiful and innocent even the most sexually perverted moments in the film albeit tame compared to today's standards have an innocent and angelic feeling to them there is just something about the way mol's nude body is portrayed that it just strikes at such a different chord than nude bodies in other films it just feels so natural and so wondrous that if there were any reason to watch the film it would be to see the spectacular depictions of mol's body as she plays bettie page br br the other reason is mol herself as page she exemplifies that 1950's southern belle everyone knows or can at least imagine despite her profession she is still a normal person and still looks at herself as being religious mol plays her exactly to the right amount of squeaky cleanliness needed to make this character feel authentically from the 1950's she plays her with such matter of factness that you would be hard set not to think that mol was actually bettie page herself br br unfortunately the supporting cast have very little moments to shine and are totally overshadowed by mol's wonderful performance none of them do anything particularly pleasing and none of them really have that same strength in their role as mol does this is not really the fault of the actors but more of the fact that they do not have much to work with many of them are totally recognizable such as oscar nominee david strathairn in a role a little too close to one of his better performances sarah paulson recent golden globe nominee for studio 60 on the sunset strip and character actor lili taylor but you would be hard set to really place their performance in being anything other than okay none of these characters are really developed and they really just stand as character cut outs who mol runs loops around as she picks up steam in her brilliant performance br br really this film is worthwhile for its portrayal of nudity and for gretchen mol's excellent performance of bettie page everything else is a bit too muddled and awkward than it should be had more work been done to develop supporting characters and not just blast right through the story this film would have been a much better biographical film as it stands it is just a vehicle for mol to really rise into the stratosphere of popularity as an actress br br 7 10
i'll say this to begin with why oh why can't wb do what these short film directors do sandy is obviously an amazing director and deserves some credit from wb and dc but i guess they're kinda put on edge when a man with a 12 000 budget can make a super hero fan drool the world's finest is one of the best short films i've ever seen trailer or not br br i think choosing a bodybuilder mike o'hearn to play superman was a genius choice let's face it people superman is no super model he may be handsome but a gq stud he is not and i don't know what that guy a few comments above me was on but superman is actually pretty beefy have you ever actually read a superman comic i guess that fact alone just floors me it seems like such an obvious choice to get someone with some actual muscle mass to play a super hero rather than a pretty face same thing for batman bartram is in incredible shape and an excellent batman i don't know guys if given a bigger budget and his own movie i think bale and bartram would be neck and neck bottom line this is one of only a scant few of super hero movies with actors that actually look the part br br the acting is pretty nice as well i don't know what every one is talking about o'hearn isn't that bad he's damn convincing as superman and bartram well he is batman i mean come on people this movie had a 12 000 dollar budget what were you expecting everyone else is great too except two face seems a tad crazier than usual but hey we only have tommy lee jones as a reference oh lois is pretty hot too br br the sfx are flippin' sweet too i mean seeing superman lift the car up man how cool is that versus the tank scene in grayson i may have to put this one above that since mike actually looks like he's flying and with ease the flying sequences left something to be desired but once again with a bigger budget oh and he even used a batmobile it was probably a model but it looked damned convincing br br all in all this trailer's only downfall was a lack of a serious budget and wb refuses to admit that collora is a credible director and needs to be apart of some kind a project but no they'll like most of the marvel projects just keep getting these hack directors who show almost no regard for the fans and what they care about and keep churning out these gamble movies thank god superman returns was a hit or that seriously would've been the end of it world's finest is excellent and in my book counts as a superhero movie
at first glance i expected this film to be crappy because i thought the plot would be so excessively feminist but i was wrong as you maybe have read in earlier published comments i agree in that the feminist part in this film does not bother i never had the idea that the main character was exaggerating her position as a woman it's like guzman is presented as somebody with a spine this in contrast to her classmates so i was surprised by the story in fact i thought it was quite good except for the predictable end maybe it would've been a better idea to give the plot a radical twist so that the viewer is somewhat more surprised br br in addition i'd like to say that rodriguez earned her respect by the way she put away her character i can't really explain why but especially in the love scenes she convinced me it just looked real i think br br i gave it a 7 out of 10 merely because of the dull last half hour
uc 0079 the one year war is almost at an end a neutral colony of side 6 has been targeted by cyclops a zeon task force their target a new gundam being built exclusively for newtypes supposedly built for amuro ray from the original gundam saga inside when little boy al izuruha a fan of zeon ms encounters a zaku after battle breaks out in the colony he befriends newbie ms pilot benard bernie wiseman the two become good friends al is treated as an honorary member of the cyclops team through the show bernie acts as a father figure to al whose real father is always working and seems to be taken with federation pilot christina mckenzie but eventually they must meet in battle al soon learns that war is not child's play and bernie must choose to make the ultimate sacrifice to complete his mission br br for only 6 episodes gundam 0080 is a well done show the mobile suits are extremely well designed and the animation may look dated but really shows emotion in the characters if you liked 0083 then check this one out or if you are new to the gundam world this is a good show to start with if you look to a show for drama and character development this is the one for you it focuses more on that then mobile suit battle i would rate it more of a drama than action br br mobile suit gundam 0080 war in the pocket br br sometimes you have to lose to win
i was required to watch the movie for my work so i didn't pay for it on the contrary i got paid but i still found the movie to suck far more than average the jokes were lame the two lead actresses well to use the first wives club division of women's ages in hollywood they are no longer in their hot chick age but more in their district attorney age what angered me most about the movie was the main plot line which pretty much completely plagiarized beavis butthead do america in which the boys are all jazzed up about some dude offering them money to do his wife not realizing they're expected to assassinate her all in all a bland piece of crap
there may something poetically right in seeing dentists suffer suffer they do in this dreary truly dreadful film but they cause the audience to undergo pain of the non dental variety too if you ever wanted to see a movie full of screaming kids barfing kids sick kids lots of long long meaningful glances a deadpan wife and a concerned husband it's all here for you boring overlong it stands out as one of those examples that scream out why is there a saving grace yes there is there is a short scene from nabucco with some pretty good singing save your money or if it's on tv or cable save your time you can always read a book or make an omelette
i managed to see this at the new york international film festival in november 2005 with my boyfriend we were both quite impressed with the complexity of the plot and found it to be emotionally moving it was very well directed with strong imagery the visual effects were amazing especially for a short it had an original fantasy approach to a very real and serious topic this film is about a young girl who is visited by a demon offering to help her situation with her abusive father there is also a surprise twist at the end which caught me off guard this leans towards the gothic feel i would love to see this as a full feature film carrie
the radar men from the moon is a pretty typical fare of 1950's serials the special effects are pretty cheap the lunar rovers are obviously world war ii surplus jeeps with painted plywood over them and the like the acting is only so so it does inspire the imagination of children to whom i believe this was directed to by today's standards it's boring cheap and bad there's also a hefty amount of stock footage in the first 9 episodes of natural disasters
of course flatley is already not exactly the ideal name for a dancer but i think michael is really pushing the irony envelope with this new title feet of flames br br one really can't resist recommending desenex foot spray to the retiring and clearly ailing flatley br br i might add that much like that cheering london crowd per review below i too am enthusiastic about this being his last live performance br br hinting that it may be his last live performance flatley is cheered on by an enthusiastic london crowd perry seibert all movie guide
this is probably one of the worst films i have ever seen the events in it are completely random and make little or no sense the fact that there is a sequel is so sickening i may come down with a case of cabin fever i'm so sorry i describe it as bug being smooshed to a newspaper because it seems to be different parts of things mixed together e g kevin the pancake loving karate kid is just freakishly weird on its own then there's the cop who is slightly weird and perverted then the drug addict then there's the fact that they attack some random guy who clearly needs help then all of a sudden the main character is having sex with his friends girlfriend just because she says something stupid about a plane going down then at the end some good old family racism followed by a rabbit operating on kevin the karate kid its actually pretty despicable that they can use racism as a joke in this film there is no reason for anyone to enjoy this film unless you love eli roth even that did not make me like this film hate is a strong word but seeing as it is the only word i am permitted to use it will have to do boycott cabin fever 2
wow i hated this movie the subject matter should have resulted in a really fine film and the lead actor was definitely sensitive and talented enough to handle the topic but the script if there even was a script is a mess this is less a movie than a random slide show that goes nowhere i'd say it goes nowhere fast except that it's actually the longest 81 minutes you'll ever sit through as i've mentioned the lead actor is good so is faruza baulk sp as his sometimes harsh but ultimately loving and accepting mother the film makers have a lot to answer for here because this is a mess a real shame because i really wanted to like this movie but it's basically out takes from a movie that never got made skip this one it wasn't even worth the 6 i shelled out for pay per view
i was thinking that the main character the astronaut with the bad case of the runs in his case his skin hair muscles etc could always get more movie work after he'd been reduced to a puddle all he has to do is get a job as the blob the premise of this flick is pretty lame an astronaut gets exposed to sunspot radiation i think and so begins to act like an ice cream cone on a hot day not only is this a puzzler but apparently he has to kill humans and consume their flesh so that he can maintain some kind of cell integrity huh have you ever noticed that whenever any kind of radiation accident or experiment happens the person instantly turns into a killing machine why is that br br the astronaut lumbers off into the night from the 'secret facility' which has no security whatsoever shedding parts of himself as he goes apparently he retains just enough memory to make him head for the launch pad maybe because he wanted to return to space br br thus begins the part of the movie that's pretty much filler with a doctor wandering around with a geiger counter trying to find the melting man by the buzz he gives off he kills a stupid bill gates look alike fisherman scares a little girl a la the frankenstein monster movie and finishes off a wacky older couple punishing them karmically for stealing some lemons then there's a short scene where he whacks his former general and a very long scene where he kills a young pothead and chases his girlfriend around you'd think that after she cuts his arm off and he run away the scene would shift but no we're treated to about ten minutes of the woman huddled into a corner panting and screaming in terror even though the monster is gone all i could think was director's girlfriend anyone br br the end of the movie is even lamer than the rest of it the melting man finishes turning into a pile of goo and then nothing that's it that's the end of the movie well at least that meant that there was no room for a sequel
well i hate hollywood but love cinema so i have to watch these cruddy movies in theaters and i was hoping vanilla sky would be good i was hoping that they would either keep the original open your eyes exactly the same or they would make it their own well it happened to be a little bit of both and it sucked br br it started out good i love radiohead i wish there was more of that but by the end we are listening to good vibrations by the beach boys talk about a wide range of suck between they had one or two good songs in the club and maybe a couple others but why oh why did they have to blare gv during the climax it was more annoying than confusing or blatant especially when it has nothing to do with the plot at least put some meaning behind the songs kid a primary whatever br br he also did a bang up job with the club scene that was cool otherwise the movie was one big ball of arrogance as if audiences would get the movie the ones that would get it read subtitles and the rest won't its as simple as that the motivations got all screwed up i didn't comprehend the diaz motivations hadn't they done the chicken soup night before and some of the others and i hate kurt russell stay overboard tom cruise can't act especially in these types of movie i e eyes wide shut and the elevator i get it anyways they tried improving the original with a crappy american rock soundtrack and crappy angles and good film print and glossy processing and it would have helped if crowe hadn't screwed it up br br 2 10 major disappointment
am i the only one who saw the connection between the discussion of camus 'the myth of sisyphus' and mary's life in camus version a man is condemned to spend his eternity with a giant boulder that he must roll up a hill unfortunately every time he reaches the top the boulder slips and ends up back at the bottom for him to start there may have been a buzzard pecking at his eyes i'm not sure right now in the movie mary spends her life struggling to get her life together unfortunately every time she gains any footing she falls and loses everything case in point would be the party she throws where she gets intoxicated offends her falafel lover and is practically attacked by liev schrieber in case you question this theory note how this scene ends with her attempting to climb a flight of stars while books fall from nowhere impeding her progress until ultimately she passes out the next morning when she awakens she is still on the stairs never having reached the top

i really enjoyed this movie the script is fresh and unpredictable and the acting is outstanding it is a down to earth movie with characters one cares about it brought tears into my eyes a few times but left me with a great feeling afterwards
this movie was a littttle confusing at first i usually like gina phillips but this one i have to say was a bad choice just like her doing the movie ring around the rosie that one also not one her good movies jeepers creepers was way better anyway faye dunaway was good she totally creeped me out and at the end that was crazy it was about jennifer cassi phillips who comes to her twin sisters funeral she stays at a house that her sister owns and her grandmother dunaway lives at with an aunt named emma mary ellen dunaway is kinda sacrificing her relations to stay alive and as long as she wants to live she can't die even if jennifer tries to kill her which she tries ravens have a weird part in it when the relations go to sleep the ravens eat there organs so they can't go to sleep but they do basically it all crazy and mary ellen will never die and her relations will be buried but not dead b c they have to suffer forever so mary ellen can stay alive yeah i hope this helps if it doesn't sorry love ya
grieving couple move to a cabin on a mountain after the loss of their daughter discovering that there may be ghosts haunting the place restless spirits of past occupants who committed suicide julie pyke cheri christian blames husband allen greg thompson for the horrible death of their daughter due to leaving the door unlocked and the marriage has deteriorated because of it julie remains in a zombie state eliciting next to no emotion remote and numb only photographing a nearby abandoned prison finding a startling image of a ghoul girl clinging to the bars of a cell though allen doesn't see anything out of the ordinary julie continues to take pictures and we can recognize that something isn't quite right a local handyman jim payne scott hodges a rather distant fellow who harbors a secret becomes a dangerous threat when it is revealed that his dead mother might have something to do with the haunts occurring to the pykes meanwhile the neighbors who sold the pykes the cabin find themselves victims as well alcoholic mr booth's abuse to his wife coming back to haunt him allen will conduct an investigation into the history of his cabin attempting to unravel the mystery about the place br br plenty of ghosts moving about in the background in this somber supernatural tale with practically every character miserable cheri christian remains so vacuous and lost it's incredibly hard to connect with her despite the fact that you understand her plight the acting as is often mentioned remains frustrating because none of the characters exactly are easy to latch on to i guess it's supposed to be this way under their circumstances but the trouble i had was never being able to properly embrace the pykes due to their constant state of aloofness cheri comes off as cold and detached as i figure a mother would tend to be when you lose a child in such a way but the icy nature left me pleading inside to embrace her which i just never could i think the right performers even if the characters are going through an emotional turmoil can grab the hearts of their viewers if a humanity reaches out to us in this movie's case the leads are unable to do so for whatever reason it could've been me i don't know i wanted to care for them but nothing in the characters tugged on my heart strings anyway as the film continues allen slowly uncovers certain truths and must defend himself against his wife who has convinced herself that their daughter is among them and she won't lose her little girl again jim the unstable neighbor who believes that to stop the hauntings plaguing the area he must kill the pykes becomes a vital threat the ghosts remain a central part of the movie their presence particularly jim's mother established throughout off in the distance the finale reveals all of them as allen must find help for his wife while trying to thwart jim's mission i had a hard time getting into this one due to my unease with the leads and their characters
may 2004 wonderland is fairly new in the uk brilliant film of a brutal true story if you know la from the early 80's you will appreciate how well it is captured the use of the elements which make up its gritty cinematic style is original amplifying the experience and bringing the viewer very close to actually being there the use of a disjointed 'pulp fiction' style time line allows exploration of the uncertainty concerning what really happened while the direction and performances of the cast command attention especially val kilmer as john holmes an oscar for sure if i were handing them out
no cinematic achievements here however that's not even the important question how does it fare in its endeavour to be a competent date movie and star vehicle br br the formula requires the cute female lead a la ryan or aniston check there's a built in tv audience br br add thick headed compliant men usually including the problem ex boyfriend fiancée check br br assemble a plot that maximizes the bankability of the stars so far so good br br what is the male lead to consist of he has to make all the women in the movie and in the audience and the gay flight stewards instantly swoon but he cannot be so hunky as to threaten to the male audience and he can't outshine the star roll cameras br br the problem is messing thinks she's still in a sitcom she has only one presentation as the wide eyed doormat that she's made a career out of a capable actress might have pulled it off after the love scene where things promptly nosedive into the soap suds br br you can't help feeling good for mulroney you can read it in his face that he sees through all of this he's gotten all the respect of a lifetime 260 hitter this time he smacks one out to the warning track and no one can figure out what to do as he amusedly takes home plate
there's no shortage of bad dialogue in david and bathsheba  i was quite a hand with a slingshot the king of all israel out there in the darkness exposing himself to the enemy full marks to dennis hooey for delivering that one with a straight face go and sit with the concubines and somehow i doubt a bored david ever told the prophet nathan whatever you say he even tries the old my kingdom doesn't understand me routine on desperate housewife bathsheba at one point so it's probably a tribute to henry king's direction that the film isn't at all bad despite the pitfalls much of the first third provide maybe it's the censor baiting nature of the plot  a married man kills a femme fatale's husband and gets away with it  but king brings out the growing moral and theological complexities in phillip dunne's script rather than upping the sin and sandals hokum this is the conflicted david on the downhill slope abandoned by a vengeful god he no longer understands and the film doesn't back away from the awkward unanswerable questions about why a loving deity would choose to wreak vengeance on the innocent rather than the guilty it even offers a genuinely surprising criticism of the sexual inequality of the law where the failings of husbands result in the punishment of their wives br br unlike king david which sidelined the king in favour of the admittedly more interesting saul david is firmly at the centre of the drama and despite an interesting display of shoulder twitching and a frankly gormless overlong close up when visiting the site of saul and jonathan's death gregory peck's performance grows in stature as david shrinks susan hayward is pure hollywood pro raymond massey is an appropriately theatrical prophet why be naturalistic when you've got a voice that makes the very heavens quake and kieron moore's uriah such an intransigent unreconstructed chauvinist that you can't exactly blame david for putting him in harm's way but despite threatening to soft peddle the film doesn't allow david a moral get out of jail free card over his death with surprisingly strong but subdued design and technicolor photography this is definitely a cut above most 40s 50s biblical epics br br fox's new dvd is a good transfer including an incredibly hokey 'candid' behind the scenes short and a trailer with brief shots deleted from the film's sole battle scene
i searched for this movie for years apparently it ain't available here in the states so bought me a copy off ebay br br four young hunters and three of their girlfriends venture into the woods searching for a bear that apparently has killed several campers what they find is an ex vietnam vet gone crazy he kills some of his victims using a glove with long metal finger nails a la freddy krueger as soon as the night falls one of the girls goes for a walk after a brief argument with her boyfriend she gets killed after one of the group finds her body they all hide in their tents waiting for daylight once the sun comes up all of them try and make it out but fall victim one by one br br seven bodies not a lot of gore but a couple of good murders especially the girls'deaths the guys get killed in somewhat bloodless ways blown up in car shot to death knife through head br br overall infernal trap is a nice slasher film from the late 80's nothing new just well acted fast paced and some pretty ladies 10 out of 10
hello this is my first review for any movie i have seen i went through the trouble of doing this to tell everyone that this is quite literally the most disgusting movie i have ever seen i feel like the movie was porely made which i will give some understanding due to budget constraints on making it i felt like i was watching a very bad remake of the movie saw which i can agree saw as well is also very graphic but i did like the movie saw br br the scene where he takes the hammer to the head of the tied up victim in the chair is the most disturbing scene i have seen the scene lasted almost forever well actually it was probably around 5 min but still i want to note that i like some horror movies and i do give credit if they are good this director uwe boll and his group of people used to make this movie should think it over before making another one similar to this one one final note haha for all the people who enjoy watching animals beatin to death letting rot with women and children as well and a five minute scene of someone getting there head smashed in with a hammer then you will enjoy this movie if not and you like horror go with a higher budget film like saw for example i cant believe people actually make movies like this anyway sorry to anyone who loves uwe boll and took it to heart this is just my opinion on the movie
this film stands head and shoulders above the vast majority of cinematic romantic comedies it is virtually flawless the writing acting production design humor and pathos are all wonderful even the music from dean martin to la boheme is captivating and delightful br br every character is peculiarly delightful and memorable from the leads played by cher and nicolas cage to the many supporting roles olympia dukakis vincent gardenia john mahoney danny aiello even grandpa with his dog pack each of these performers plus norman jewison as director performs above their normal quality in this ensemble work for several of the actors this was an early major exposure in film so the casting is also exceptional and we have many current acting powerhouses whose careers were altered by their effectiveness in this film br br i've seen this film several times all the way through which can sometimes deflate the impact of a film substantially more tellingly i realized some years ago that whenever i channel surfed my way into a scene from this film any scene the scene was compelling and beautifully crafted there are so many stunning and memorable scenes the original meeting between the cher and nicolas cage characters where cage tells his tale of woe vincent gardenia discovered with his paramour at the opera amidst the splendor generated by his gold mine plumbing business olympia dukakis scolding john mahoney for philandering with his student in the classic line about liaisons with co workers don't sh t where you eat danny aiello at his dying mother's bedside nicolas cage taking cher as the rapture of an aria soars in the background br br there are of course many great romantic comedies among them sabrina both versions but especially the audrey hepburn humphrey bogart william holden original when harry met sally the apartment br br none quite equals moonstruck
really no reason to examine this much further because of a few very glaring and bias misleading statements br br a perfect example is when the filmmaker claims saul or paul of tarus the writer of the book of hebrews he asserts has no idea jesus is or was a human being this assertion is either purposely false as he accuses others of presenting or he is ignorant of what the bible says br br first we can examine his misleading claim about hebrews 8 4 which he shows a quote if jesus was on earth he would not be a priest hence right here he sets up the ignorant and unlearned viewer to accept his false premise why he does what most so called bible believing people he accuses of doing the same that is taking things out of context br br verse one of hebrews 8 is 1 now of the things which we have spoken this is the sum we have such an high priest who is set on the right hand of the throne of the majesty in the heavens the context above is clearly speaking of a jesus who was on earth and ascended into heaven after his alleged resurrection br br it has nothing to do with how the filmmaker wants the viewer to take his out of context scripture here he offers a foundation that paul was not aware of a human jesus but only one in heaven br br follow br br lets see if the filmmaker is being honest hebrews 7 14 for it is evident that our lord sprang out of judah of which tribe moses spake nothing concerning priesthood br br heh didn't the filmmaker just quote from the writer of hebrews trying to show the writer of that book has no knowledge of a human jesus it's likely anyways paul didn't write hebrews but i will not go into that here but the film maker asserts paul did and that is the premise of the point given here br br it is not like this film maker does not make decent points in certain areas he does but he is engaging in the same blind bias of the religion he is bashing on once he engages in these tactics in my strong opinion he loses credibility as the religion he picks out and the film is no longer a documentary but a personal opinion and a bias of the film maker nothing more nothing less
streisand fans only familiar with her work from the funny girl film onwards need to see this show to see what a brilliant performer streisand was before she achieved her goal of becoming a movie star there had never been a female singer quite like her ever before and there never would be again sorry celine only in your dreams but never again would streisand sing with the vibrancy energy and above all the enthusiasm and vulnerability with which she performs here by the time she gets to that central park concert only 2 or 3 years later she'd been filming funny girl in hollywood and her performing style has become less spontaneous and more reserved more rehearsed and let's face it more angry there's a wall between her and the audience live performing was never what she really enjoyed she did it because she knew it was her ticket to hollywood and once she no longer had to do it she's done it as little as possible and oh that legendary stage fright provides such a good excuse br br her vocals here and on her earlier judy garland show appearance are incredible streisand could truly make an old song sound new again and composers such as richard rodgers and harold arlen loved her for it but by the 1970s streisand was trying to be a rock singer her albums pandering to the younger audiences with over wrought shrieking of songs that were unworthy of her effort or her voice br br in the '80s she came back with that brilliant broadway album but went on and on about what a struggle it was to get it done how they told her not to do it etc oh please when has anyone told streisand what to do she could have been doing good stuff like that all along bringing audiences up to her level instead of stooping to what she thought the young public wanted the back to broadway sequel wasn't nearly as good as streisand seems to feel it necessary to improve on other composers' work if he were alive at the time would richard rodgers have even recognized his own some enchanted evening rodgers notorious for taking singers to task for playing around with his melodies would undoubtedly have been after streisand to sing what he'd written she also blows michael crawford off the cd in their duet of music of the night apparently reminding him just whose cd this is why does she insist on taking songs that are duets and singing them by herself and songs that aren't duets and singing them as duets with someone else who she then goes on to diminish br br supposedly judy garland took streisand aside and advised her don't let them do to you what they did to me advice streisand wasted no time in heeding despite her protestations to the contrary surely it looks like it's always been her way or the highway just imagine she told the cbs brass how her first tv special would be done no guests just her br br but nobody can argue with the results that are so evident here treat yourself to this brilliant musical phenomenon before she was a legend you'll be absolutely amazed at the difference br br ps i watched this again last night 12 01 after not having seen it for many years it was even better than i remembered the 1st act begins with i'm late and includes make believe and how does the wine taste and barbra's homage to childhood i'm five it climaxes as streisand appears with full and i mean full orchestra to sing people she wasn't bored with the song yet and although it's a somewhat shorter rendition it really soars compare it to some of her later auto pilot versions the 2nd act after streisand's kooky schtick patter which hasn't changed much over the years is the famous series of depression songs set amidst the extravagance of bergdorf goodman's br br the 3rd act is the stunner call it streisand the orchestra and the audience although we never see the audience that supposedly witness this historic event with her fear of audiences and dislike of such performing this may have been the toughest part for her but if so to her credit it doesn't show she tears through lover come back to me and the torchy when the sun comes out though i can't remember in which order the poignant why did i choose you one of my all time favorite streisand performances and offers a medley of funny girl songs including of course don't rain on my parade and my favorite song from the score the music that makes me dance explaining that fanny brice sang a song like that in 1922 and it made her the toast of broadway streisand then sings my man and it's almost a dress rehearsal template for her later screen rendition in the funny girl film the main difference being that the black gown here is sleeveless her film gown had long sleeves and against the black background all we saw were her hands and face but the vocal here is more urgent and charged than her later film vocal her performance of the song has everything to do with streisand and nothing to do with fanny brice who of course never sang the song in such an all out manner as streisand does here or in the film see the great ziegfield for a glimpse of brice's more understated version the show ends with streisand singing happy days are here again over the credits br br when it was over i said to the friend i was watching it with she has never ever done anything better br br and she was twenty three years old
monika mitchell's showbiz satire has some laughs and some premeditated violence i wouldn't say blood soaked but there is insult and injury max matteo john cassini is a character actor that has a quirky adaptable presence on screen but he has a terrible track record of being chosen for the parts he goes after there is always a producer's nephew or seemingly trivial reason for his not being awarded the role he seeks well the best thing to do is get rid of the competition max becomes obsessed with such thoughts the rewarding career is just a swing push and shot away other cast members rene rivera molly parker jennifer beals frank cassini and cameos by eric roberts and sandra oh well that's show business or is it
i saw this recently on a cable channel the movie is great it's one of the few musicals i have seen that doesn't shy away from the light and dark it portrays some of the splendour of the age along with a lot of the squalor some of the set piece dance sequences so much is going on i didn't know where to look next one day i shall go and see this on the big screen just so that i see what's happening but what really lifts this to another level is oliver reed's performance as bill sykes not only is a thoroughly mean and menacing man but there is something else some inner demons he gave me the impression that if you pushed him into a corner he was capable of anything it was almost as if the sykes character was on the edge of madness just awaiting the trigger i have seen the robert newton's bill sykes from the 1948 movie and i thought he was 'just' a bad egg but oliver reed's performance intimidated me in my own living room
with stunning cinematography and a thread of kafkaesque absurdity this movie had me from the simple yet fascinating opening scene the movie plays much like a dream and i think that may be why people either hate it or love it characters are drawn superficially and the story itself is slight and perhaps a little pointless but these are failings of the movie but conscious choices the film works isn't trying to work as history but rather is a deconstruction of 1940s war movies br br i would have trouble arguing that there was much real substance to the movie but the movie is such a cinematic wonder that i was completely swept away this is one of the most beautifully filmed movies ever and there is a wild imagination in its style i can completely understand why people would hate it but i give it 9 10
the thing about my folks is a wonderful film about relationships first and foremost an adult son and his father but also that son with his wife his sisters and his mother paul reiser has written a semi autobiographical movie about his relationship with his father the movie is funny poignant and thought provoking it led me to re evaluate my own relationship with both my now deceased father and my adult son peter falk is excellent as paul's father the role could not have been better cast i hope that both mr falk and mr reiser are recognized in next year's movie awards for their efforts falk for his performance and reiser for his script
worst movie with the best reviews given it i've ever seen over the top dialog acting and direction more slasher flick than thriller with all the great reviews this movie got i'm appalled that it turned out so silly shame on you martin scorsese
i saw brother's shadow at the tribeca film festival and loved it judd hirsch and scott cohen are great as father and son the film follows scott cohen from parole in alaska back to his family in brooklyn he shows up there because his brother has died and he embarks on a journey to slowly repair his estranged relationships with his brother's wife and child and his father who has never forgiven him for being the black sheep of the family the story takes us deep into the hearts and minds of this family and allows you to more deeply understand the complexity of their lives also the imagery of the woodworking business and the brooklyn backdrop sets the tone for this rich and revealing family portrait
when watching a bug's life for the first time in a long while i couldn't help but see the comparisons with last year's happy feet as far as the main storyline goes they are very similar an outcast doing what he can to fit in while also attempting to be special it just goes to show you how much better that film could have been without its liberal diatribe conclusion a lot of people disagree with me when i say that i really like pixar's sophomore effort sure it doesn't manage to capture the splendor of toy story nor is the animation out of this world however the story is top notch and the characters are wonderful to spend time with with plenty of laughs and a moral center to boot i could watch this one just as much as the studio's other classics br br there is a lot about finding strength from within to conquer all odds here between our lead flick needing to keep his self esteem up to save his colony the colony needing to open their eyes onto a new way of living for the future and the circus bugs finding that they are more than just untalented sideshow freaks everyone evolves into a better bug by the end of the story even the villain hopper is fully fleshed and menacing for the right reasons he is not doing it to be mean but instead understands the fact that the ants outnumber him 100 to 1 he needs them to fear him in order to not have to worry about them finding out the truth it is very much a circle of life but not one that can't evolve with the ages br br when thinking about the animation it is actually quite good compared to antz the rival film of the time this is much more realistic and less cartoony the water is rendered nicely as is the foliage you don't have to look much further than the ants' eyes to see how much detail went into the production the reflections and moistness despite the smooth exterior shows the realism all the bugs are finely crafted too the flies in the city and the crazy mix of creatures recruited to save the ants are never skimped on whether for a small role or a more expanded one it is also in the city that we see the workmanship on the environments while ant island is nice it is just the outdoors bug city contains plenty of garbage doubling as buildings and clubs it is a great showing of humor and inventiveness to see what the animators used for everything from the ice cube trays as circus stands the animal crackers box as circus wagoncomplete with full nutrition guide on the sideand crazy compilation of boxes to create a times square of billboards and facades everything is done right br br as far as much of the humor you have to credit the acting talent for wonderful delivery and inspired role choices no one could do a male ladybug better than dennis leary with his acerbic wit i dare you to think of someone better our leads are great too with dave foley as flick and julia louis dreyfus as princess atta as well as the always fantastic kevin spacey as hopper spacey not only steals many scenes from the movie but also takes center stage in the bloopers during the credits yes a bug's life was the originator of animated outtakes from pixar a tradition that has continued on with many tongue in cheek bug jokes laced throughout you also have to give props to the huge supporting cast full of those guy actors it is people like richard kind brad garrett and the late joe ranft as heimlich the worm who bring the biggest laughs br br overall it may be the simplest story brought to screen by pixar one that has been told in one form or the other numerous times over the years but it is inspired enough and fresh enough to deliver an enjoyable experience there are joyous moments sad times and even action packed scenes of suspense with birds coming in to join the fun complete with a couple of my favorite pixar characters tuck and roll there isn't too much bad that i can think of saying about it
apparently the mutilation man is about a guy who wanders the land performing shows of self mutilation as a way of coping with his abusive childhood i use the word 'apparently' because without listening to a director andy copp's commentary which i didn't have available to me or reading up on the film prior to watching viewers won't have a clue what it is about br br gorehounds and fans of extreme movies may be lured into watching the mutilation man with the promise of some harsh scenes of splatter and unsettling real life footage but unless they're also fond of pretentious headache inducing experimental art house cinema they'll find this one a real chore to sit through br br 82 minutes of ugly imagery accompanied by dis chordant sound terrible music and incomprehensible dialogue this mind numbingly awful drivel is the perfect way to test one's sanity if you've still got all your marbles you'll switch this rubbish off and watch something decent instead i watched the whole thing but am well aware that i'm completely barking
this movie commits what i would call an emotional rape on the viewer the movie supposedly caused quite a stir among the critics in cannes but for me the final scene was just a pathetic attempt for a newbie director to get himself noticed hardly a voice in the discussion on the issue of violence drug abuse or juvenile delinquency or any other issue for that matter br br the main character's metamorphosis from good but troubled boy to the vicious rapist is virtually nonexistent whereas the rape scene being an over dragged exaggerated version of the rape scene from a clockwork orange is unbearable and i refuse to comment on its aesthetic values there are some things an artist should not do to try and achieve his her goal at least in my opinion br br to wrap it up shockingly brutal revolting and not worth your time see a clockwork orange or le pianiste instead
i was quite pleased to find this movie in the local video library cary grant in a comedy set in the services director stanley donen so far what's not to like it's the sort of film that has me wondering two things when did all involved including some well known names realize they had a turkey on their hands and what's the worst thing about it among a number of contending aspects still pondering the first but my vote for the latter goes to the meandering storyline ahead of the wordy sometimes pretentious script the uncertain tone the lack of consistent and well developed characterization and the lack of rapport between the characters you have to add very uneven acting to the criticism but it's understandable that the actors were struggling with this stuff and in addition seem under rehearsed quite often they can hardly get their lines out quick enough cary grant tries to portray his usual charming and urbane persona but at times seems uneasy and staccato in his delivery i have to say however that i was relieved when the initial suggestions his character will be paired with the unspeakably vulgar jayne mansfield go away with the appearance of suzy parker what's to like about the film for me chiefly the beauty of parker who also acts with restraint and a grace kelly like dignity generally speaking the film is nice to look at the naval characters are very smart in their uniforms however you have to truly wonder at the ghastly black fu manchu tunics they don in their luxury hotel suite even grant can't look elegant in his back to the credit side ray walston does a commendable job with his character and for me there was an interest in hearing a pre hogan's heroes werner klemperer speak without an assumed german accent
so let me start off by saying that i saw this movie as part of a bargain i was really bored one fine 1997 day and so i biked over to the movie rental store i asked the clerk what the worst movie he had in stock was without hesitation he walked me over to lucky stiff he told me that he'd waive the 1 rental fee he said it would be wrong to charge more if i promised to watch the whole movie so watch it i did for free br br this movie is terrible god awful even i don't need to go into plot details read the other reviews the jokes make no sense the acting was terrible i know it was supposed to be a comedy but the stupidity of the main character was exhausting you might try to watch it as something to laugh at but it's so bad that it isn't even funny in that way avoid
the title above is used to introduce the film gen to its audience gen is about a young doctor doga rutkay with an ill mother the film starts with her leaving her mother behind to start her new job while she drives we realise that she is not that close home as the hospital is in a remote area as soon as she steps into the garden of the hospital she sees the death body of a patient this is the beginning of a nightmare for the next few days br br two policemen comes to the hospital so as to investigate the suicide in fact they will have to stay in the hospital because all roads are cut off due to bad weather conditions all their communication with outside world is cut off too there is no way out in those few days there will be more nasty murders now everybody suspects from each other br br in my opinion the idea is brilliant it could have been very scary indeed there are positive sides of the movie of course i really like the beginning of the movie especially when she drives to the hospital and her first moments in the hospital actings are okay some of them are trying too hard to be mysterious and scary though i think the final shock should have been spread into the through out of the movie what i am saying is it was a good twist but instead of showing it as a parody in the end we should have realised that was coming when we see what is happening the director needed to explain it altogether which i think didn't work well also the most dangerous patient in the movie is supposed to be at least 48 years old but his body looks so young and fit for someone who spends most of his life in this hospital lastly i would like to say a few things about the director i am sure he will improve this is his first attempt i have recently found out that he is only 21 years old that made me feel more positive about him and his future films i am not going to rate this film out of though
everything a musical comedy should be gene kelly as joe brady doesn't miss a step and frank sinatra as clarence doolittle doesn't miss a note scenes with them together are very good showing how much talent can add to a somewhat uneven plot sinatra's i fall in love too easily is an indication of his then and future best kelly's mexican hat dance with a young mexican girl is delightful kelly certainly earned his nomination as best actor and there is a bushel of truly funny lines like you think the navy takes dopes you think anybody sings a sailor to sleep and we got in a little trouble we picked up a little kid a thoroughly enjoyable movie just the thing for shaking off the dust of a recently concluded world war ii
baseketball is indeed a really funny movie david zucker manages to make us all laugh our heads off again in a really silly but many times smart comedy br br the 2 creators of south park the main actors in this film play very good surprisingly good actually but this is the first time i see them as actors the movie oftenly reminded me of south park one of my fav shows br br it's a really good and funny film so don't miss it br br vote 7 5 out of 10
why did the histories of mary and rhoda have to be so dour divorced women with indifferent daughters and why very little reference to the original show and characters the daughter characters were silly and uninteresting why can't there ever be daughters who like their mother's on tv it makes sense that mary would leave minneapolis and rhoda would return to nyc but why couldn't phyllis or sue ann nivens be guest stars it just seems a pitiful way to remember such wonderful characters it was good to see mary and rhoda together of course but it could have been better much better well there has been a mary tyler moore show reunion a dick van dyke show reunion hopefully mary will do better next time if she revisits her old mary richards stomping grounds again
lil bush is a 30 minute cartoon show comprised of 2 15 minutes episodes shown on comedy central it takes place in a fictional cartoonish washington d c and centers around the satirical childish representations of george w bush condoleeza rice donald rumsfeld and dick cheyney other politicians are also satirized in the same manner and act as minor characters br br the pilot of little bush much to this commentator's expectations proved to be a rather shallow and esoteric production which barely delivers on its featured promise a satirical look at the current presidential administration while one must admit that premise of the show does have some merit even though it would be hard to imagine a show based almost completely of the denigration of a single political persona would survive to continue to produce episodes after his term of office expired execution that can only be described as sloppy at best and downright awful at worst has marred what little potential the show had br br lil bush which may be technically classified as satire tends to disregard its actual use of the particular tool of comedy in order to lambaste its targets in exceptionally vulgar but not particularly original entertaining or funny ways the show's consistently weak writing often consists of little more than recording bush cheney jokes heard elsewhere ad nauseam and placing them all in a single 30 minute block of television as such most of the jokes that presented by the writers were shameless clichés some of which that been in public circulation for more than 6 years already comparing the vice president to darth vader for example may have been funny in the first 300 times one has heard it on the daily show colbert report letterman conan o'brien leno monologue any late night talk show ever but it is not funny here as if that were not enough the show's plots seem to exist simply as a means to advance the same old tiresome bush jokes that the writers have made the center of the program br br in the show's defense when the writers dare to write in a truly original joke which seems to be a rarity it is often somewhat humorous if the show were to expand its depth somewhat and place its characters into new situations exotic situations rather than the same old mistakes and quagmires perpetuated by the bush administration therefore not having to rely on the same old bush jokes over and over again the show might be considered somewhat tolerable and possibly even innovative br br ultimately it is difficult to ascertain which shortcoming causes the lil bush series the most damage its clear lack of originality and weak writing quality or its painfully narrow minded ambitions it is reasonable to expect that lil bush will be able to maintain a small base of left wing fans that is if they are able to endure the exceptionally poor writing so long as the program continues to lampoon the bush administration thoroughly even so the majority of viewers will soon recognize the program for what it really is a weak and pointlessly vulgar attempt at satire and tune out in search of something more intellectually stimulation the price is right perhaps
time paradoxes are the devil's snare for underemployed minds they're fun to consider in a 'what if ' sort of way film makers and authors have dealt with this time and again in a host of films and television including 'star trek first contact' the 'back to the future' trilogy 'bill and ted's excellent adventure' 'groundhog day' and the stargate sg1 homage 'window of opportunity' heinlein's 'all you zombies' was written decades ago and yet it will still spin out people reading that short story for the first time br br in the case of terry gilliam's excellent film '12 monkeys' it's hard to establish what may be continuity problems versus plot elements intended to make us re think our conception of the film repeated viewings will drive us to different conclusions if we retain an open mind br br some seeing the film for the first time will regard cole played by bruce willis as a schizophrenic most will see cole as a man disturbed by what adams describes as 'the continual wrenching of experience' visited upon him by time travel br br unlike other time travel stories '12 monkeys' is unclear as to whether future history can be changed by manipulating events in the past cole tells his psychiatrist railly madeleine stowe that time cannot be changed but a phone call he makes from the airport is intercepted by scientists after he has been sent back to 1996 in his own personal time line br br even this could be construed as an event that had to happen in a single time line universe in order to ensure that the time line is not altered cole has to die before the eyes of his younger self for fate to be realised if that's the case time is like a fluid it always finds its own level or path irrespective of the external forces working on it it boggles the mind to dwell on this sort of thing too much br br if you can change future events that then guide the actions of those with the power to send people back in time as we see on board the plane at the end of the film then that means the future can be changed by manipulating past events or does it the film has probably led to plenty of drunken brawls at bars frequented by physicists and mathematicians br br bonus material on the dvd makes for very interesting viewing gilliam was under more than normal pressure to bring the film in under budget which is no particular surprise after the 'munchausen' debacle and in light of his later attempt to film 'don quixote' i would rate the 'making of' documentary as one of the more interesting i've seen it certainly is no whitewash and accurately observes the difficulties and occasional conflict arising between the creative people involved gilliam's description of the film as his 7½th release on account of the film being written by writers other than himself and therefore not really 'his' film' doesn't do the film itself justice br br brad pitt's portrayal of goines is curiously engaging although his character is not especially sympathetic watch for his slightly wall eyed look in one of the scenes from the asylum it's disturbing and distracting br br probably a coincidence the louis armstrong song 'what a wonderful world' was used at the end of both '12 monkeys' and the final episode of the tv series of 'the hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy' both the film and the tv series also featured british actor simon jones br br '12 monkeys' is a science fiction story that will entertain in the same way that the mental stimulation of a game of chess may entertain it's not a mindless recreation that's for sure
i grew up with scooby kinda the re runs of where are you i hate scrappy love daphne and feel its not complete with out the whole gang but this is sad scooby doo is mystery solving comedy not bad totally spy's jap anime i like whats new they had to give danger prone daphne a makeover sometime and try to lose the sex drug jokes of many a generation but this get a clue is flat out crap and should not have the scooby name attached they even tried to do some lame punk thing with the theme song now i'm gonna go watch my dvd of scooby doo where are you to wash the filth of this new series off my eyes
wow i just saw this on t v as one of the scary movies they show around halloween was this rated g there wasn't really anything to make this movie scary or worth watching also other people say this is a spoof but i don't think so for a spoof you need something called humor this low budget crap fest didn't have a shred of humor and it didn't make much sense either you basically have a goofy looking monster man in rubber suit coming out of closets killing people i guess since you never see the monster doing violence to anyone or any bloody aftermath the spinning newspaper tells you that people were killed by the monster so i guess that's good enough br br the military tries feebly to kill the monster which isn't much larger than a man they have very bad aim then the military flees wow did this movie make the u s military look pathetic or what the monster while hard to kill doesn't do much besides shuffle around and roar oh and occasionally a second head pops out of its mouth and shrieks it was a slightly interesting yet a total alien ripoff br br what was the deal with the scientist playing the xylophone to attract the monster it was hard to understand a lot of the dialog due to the poor sound quality also why did the monster carry around the main wimpy guy for so long why didn't the monster go into the closet when it had a chance why do i insist on trying to make sense out of the senseless
in the rapid economic development of 1990's in china there is a resurgence of traditional chinese culture partially due to the rise of nationalism accompanied by the increase in wealth and more importantly due to the sense of spiritual belonging after the collapse of the old socialist ideology in the post cultural revolutionary era br br however the resurgence of chinese traditional culture namely the confucianism was not without disasters because chinese are adopted the entire tradition without eliminating the bad part and the discrimination against girls demonstrated in this film is an excellent example br br moreover not only the part that should be discarded were inherited the good part that was supposed to be inherited such as the traditional opera and its technique such as changing face was ignored in the resurgence and facing extinction br br the director used this film to criticize the problem of re embracing tradition by contemporary china and this is the deeper meaning behind the movie
the idea of in the name of the people is good a murderer doesn't want his only daughter to end up in an institution and asks the parents of the girl he killed to take care of his daughter and you could expect of the actors especially scott bakula to do some good acting unfortunately they don't in the name of the people turns out to be the regular friday night tearjerker the flashbacks with the girl that was killed are pretty pathetic and at a certain stage you can just predict what the actors will say if you want to watch a good film about this subject then watch dean man walking
guy walking around without motive i will never get those two hours of my life back the guy kept on assuming identities and cheating on his pregnant wife what was i thinking how did this win a price anywhere i understood he loved his father but other than that the movie was completely senseless to me what was the purpose of walking so much and going to the funeral of a stranger for no apparent reason how did this enrich his life why did we have to see the dying old lady on her underwear why br br i though it would be deep or about something more interesting i do not recommend the movie even to leave on while sleeping
though i did not begin to read the classics in literature until i was 47 it's never too late jane eyre is a favorite for many reasons mainly because there isn't a part of the book i liked less only parts i enjoyed more the 1983 tv mini series with zelah clarke and timothy dalton was everything i hoped it would be i saw it as a full length movie in 2006 dalton's 'mr rochester' was very good but i absolutely loved zelah's 'jane eyre' relecting on another 'classics' movie i saw recently i was disappointed in the production direction and dialogue it was only faithful to the avarice and arrogance of hollywood artistic license to the great works in literature is nothing short of plagiarism using the title after such license is fraud leave it to the brits to get this one right among others you won't be able to reread the book without reliving the movie with it's proper context and spirit well done bbc
long on action and stunt work but so short on character delineation and development that it failed to hold our interest not always easy to figure out which side a character is on and who's doing what to whom
why else would he do this to me br br not that i expect dean cain to produce hit movies or even decent movies i saw lois and clark i am aware of just how good dean cain is br br obviously this is gonna be a cheesey flick and each cheesey flick has its own special way to make you scratch your head i will not call these spoilers as you can't really spoil this movie any more than it already is br br to begin with why is that a fake helicopter i mean why br br how come that one scientist is from chicago and that other scientist is from la and neither one could be any more eastern european if they tried how hard would it have been to get either an american actor or just change that lame state sheet the movie provides us with to say those people aren't american br br why are there 2 occasions when the movie gives us a slug line we get helipad day and then mess hall day later on and then that's it who cares about the timeline to be honest who cared about it even when they mentioned it but i guess that's beside the point br br does a movie really get better if you are able to view it through multiple split screens the answer is no br br that dragon sure can walk down that hall over and over and over and over br br who on earth was responsible for one of the worst endings in film history it was straight out of scooby doo oh the dragon's dead now say wanna get dinner sure but not at some chinese place with dragon in the name ah ha ha ha ha ha ha haha ha i used to be superman aha ha ha ha ha br br fade to black br br my god it made me cringe it was so stupid br br but never fear even though the whole building exploded and no one was left alive for some reason there's a second untouched unmanned lab that survived pretty well so they can make a sequel hurray for us all br br
this movie is one of the worst movies i have ever seen there is absolutely no storyline the gags are only for retards and there is absolutely nothing else that would make this movie worth watching in the whole movie fredi oh my god what a funny name ha ha doesn't ask himself once how he came from a plane to middle earth there are plenty of stupid and totally unfunny characters whose names should sound funny e g gandalf is called almghandi sam is called pupsi and so on i didn't even smile once during the whole movie the gags seem like they were made by people whose iq is negative if you laugh when someone's coat is trapped in the door this happens about 5 times then this movie is perhaps for you another funny scene they try to guess the code word for a closed door don't ask why don't ever ask why in this movie and the code word is ha ha dung so if you laughed at this examples you might like this movie for everybody else go to youtube and watch lord of the weed it's a lot lot more fun
director writer andrés waissbluth worked seven years to complete this two hour film about the crime underground in santiago chile and perhaps that is one of the reasons the resultant film seems episodic and in need of editing or maybe this is the technique of a director who shows a fine sense of film noir storytelling br br two brothers silvio the elder néstor cantillana and victor the younger juan pablo miranda have moved to santiago from their home in temuco after their parents' death and silvio works to support victor's education on victor's seventeenth birthday silvio takes the virgin out to the clubs where he encourages victor to lose his virginity with one of the club's stripper prostitutes in a tender scene victor must face his nascent impotency while silvio is out on the club floor impressing the 'owners' with his potential for hire br br silvio goes to work for the 'gang' as a bodyguard henchman and makes good money to support victor's schooling but victor has eyes for one of the dancers at the club named gracia antonella ríos and begins to woo her dropping out of school incurring silvio's angry disappointment gracia just happens to be the squeeze of the club gang's leader don pascual alejandro trejo who is silvio's boss gracia is the glue that holds this tale together as she is the paramour of victor silvio and don pascual and the consequences of this bizarre ménage a trois has deadly results through a means of re telling the story through the eyes of victor silvio and gracia we grow to understand the vulnerabilities and the cracks in each character that allow for the downfall that results br br sound like a chilean pulp fiction well it is and it is filmed in a brutally colorful dark manner that includes a lot of frontal nudity both female and male and provocative sexual encounters but in the end the sensual aspect of the director's vision is what drives this film playing on the debutante virginal psyche against the hardcore professional sex worker with success the cast is fairly strong especially antonella ríos in the demanding role of gracia there are enough twists and turns and replays of incidents you think you understood the first viewing but that change dramatically in impact when told through the eyes of a different character bordering on two hours some judicious editing would have helped the impact of the film in spanish with english subtitles recommended for those who like the edgy film noir style and the art of south american cinema grady harp
i saw this movie in the middle of the night when i was flipping through the channels and there was nothing else on to watch it's one of those films where you stop to see what it is just for a moment but realize after twenty minutes or so that you just can't turn it off no matter how bad it is one of those movies that is somewhere in between being so bad it's good and so bad it's well just plain bad it's worth seeing just to experience the confusion of realizing that it's both great middle of the night fare if only for the fabulous tennis drag don't even bother asking yourself why nobody can tell that chad lowe is so obviously male because logic does not apply
tara reid as an intellectual christian slater usually great as a dollar store constantine and stephen dorff as well it's stephen dorff for christ sake i personally just want to thank those brilliant casting directors for the hard work and effort you guys are on heres an idea just my humble lowly opinion as the movie going public but it follows directly with your previous choices a movie about the most brilliant neuro physicist in history invent one pill to cure all diseases ever known to man and get this heres the clincher they have to be played by jessica simpson and paris hilton i knew you guys would love that seriously though you owe me 7 50
in this film we have the fabulous opportunity to see what happened to timon and pumbaa in the film when they are not shown which is a lot this film even goes back to before simba and presumbably just after the birth of kiara br br quite true to the first film lion king 1 2 or lion king 3 in other places is a funny entertaining exciting and surprising film or sequel if that's what you want to call it a bundle of surprises and hilarity await for you br br while timon and pumbaa are watching a film at the cinema with a remote control timon and pumbaa have an argument of what point of the lion king they are going to start watching as timon wants to go to the part when he and pumbaa come in and pumbaa wants to go back to the beginning they have a very fair compromise of watching the film of their own story which is what awaits it starts with timon's first home br br for anyone with a good sense of humour who liked the first films of just about any age enjoy lion king 1 2
shallow shallow script stilted acting the shadows of boom mikes lingering over the actors' heads in scenes worth watching because kate mulgrew plays the most selfish mother in tv movie history and it's all before ben affleck got his teeth capped
br br it's a generic coming of age story think the member of the wedding summer of '42 a summer place even little women and there are moments where mulligan might have omitted the soupy music not used slow motion or played down the golden lit prettiness of the setting otherwise it's done with rare emotional perfect pitch nothing's forced every line has feeling and the pacing is just right even the below a list casting helps bigger movie stars with more recognizable personalities might have overwhelmed the material in particular witherspoon is excellent her line readings are fresh and original and her body language is just right for a gawky hoydenish 14 year old on the eve of womanhood waterston is also very fine even if he has to spend much of the movie climbing in and out of the family truck br br one senses that the film's makers were aware of its unpromising commercial prospects no big stars no big car crashes no special effects and consciously decided to make the best possible movie box office be damned it's intimate and honest and it sticks to the ribs if you find yourself misting up at the end you don't have to feel you've been duped
terry gilliam's stunning feature length adaptation of chris marker's short film la jetee is full of mind bending surprises yet still touches your heart thanks to the superb cast gilliam's flair for the phantasmagorical works with the script by david and janet peoples to play with your head as much as it does with poor james cole willis at his most steve mcqueen like better than mcqueen even a time traveling convict from the future who literally doesn't know whether he's coming or going as a team of scientists keeps sending him back to the wrong eras while trying to prevent a 1995 plague that's deadly to humans but harmless to animals willis the justifiably oscar nominated brad pitt and madeline stowe as a well meaning psychiatrist give some of the best performances of their careers even paul buckmaster's tango style score is haunting this one's a don't miss
dark comedy gallows humor how does one make a comedy out of murder it can be risky business as the viewer is required to let go of their moral values and laugh at the antics of a man who kills people so the story has be rock solid with a good dash of suspended reality in order to make it work so pierce brosnan the irishman's answer to 007 is now cast as a chain smoking sex addicted alcoholic who kills people for a living and is having a life crisis he meets a struggling businessman greg kinnear and after a rocky beginning he learns that he needs a friend but greg's happily married to hope davis and brosnan sees in him the basic things he doesn't have love home and a life add character actor philip baker hall as the hit man's manager and we're off to the races brosnan is wonderfully crass and crude as the anti hero and kinnear delightful as his counterpart the very human businessman hope davis adds a sparkle as kinnear's very conventional wife who is fascinated with this derelict who drifts into their lives the ending is delightful and with some surprise to it you should leave the theater feeling at least partly good if you're able to suspend being aghast at killing people
charleton heston wore one james franciscus wore one but mark wahlberg opts not to don the traditional loin cloth i hope no one casts him as tarzan linda harrison wore a bikini in the first 2 planet movies but estrella warren barely shows cleavage her hair is always in the way tim burton could have sexed up this simian saga given the adults in the audience something to look at even the chaste helena bonham carter never gets out of her costume which looks like a large curtain she's cute but all the the love stuff is restricted to anxious looks a little bitty kiss at the end as in artificial intelligence which discusses inter species sex between robots humans but never delivers planet of the apes hints at inter species romance between the humans the apes but only hints lisa marie is the only ape that dares to be sexy this movie has three great actors tim roth ms carter paul giamatti chewing up the scenery as a trio of apes they are fun to watch superlative make up a certain oscar costumes sets music make this the hit summer movie of 2001
enjoyable movie although i think it had the potential to be even better if it had more depth to it it is a mystery halfway through the film as to knowing why elly is such a recluse then when we are finally given an explanation going back to her childhood there still isn't much detail perhaps had they shown flashbacks or something br br anyway it is still a good movie that i'd watch again 7 10 br br
envy stars some of the best jack black ben stiller amy poehler and the great christopher walken with such a cast one can only expect the best however with envy no one could save this disaster br br tim dingman stiller and nick vanderpark black are best friends and co workers at a sandpaper factory both are making a decent living but because tim has a better performance at work he's able to afford more than his buddy nick nick is a dreamer who's always coming up with new ideas for inventions one day nick comes up with the idea for a spray can that makes dog poop disappear yes i'm serious falling in love with the idea nick decides to really invent this product he makes an offer to tim to invest in his idea and share the profits 50 50 tim refuses thinking the idea will never work br br nick's invention titled va poo rize again i'm serious ends up making millions he enjoys spending his money on things like a much larger house a horse a personal trainer and fancy deserts tim starts feeling envy for nick hence the name of the movie br br the concept isn't bad but it still turns out awful this movie contains some of the worst dialog and very poor performances from all the cast then again as i mentioned earlier none of them could save this mess not even the great christoper walken playing a homeless character named j man made this movie funny the movie is bad from the start and only continues to get worse br br i recommend this movie if you like crap no pun intended you want to see jack black in a white tux br br i say avoid this movie at all costs but avoid especially if you're offended by bathroom humor you love animals
nothing to say but wow has anyone actually had somebody sneak up on them in an open field well this happens about 25 times in this movie clearly the directors' favorite scare tactic in one of the opening scenes the smooth talking hot shot producer has to ride in the back seat so the camera man could sit in the front to film shortly after he arrives to the field the 5 contestants show up and although it is clearly at latest 2 in the afternoon they are all convinced that the sun will set any minute after about 30 minutes of boobless trash we are privileged with a flashback of the clown's history in which we see some of his previous victims if you watch this movie check out the ladies chest her ribs go all the way to her neck it was flat out disgusting most horror movies action occurs during the night but without a night vision camera the chaos is forced to happen during the day the few night shots that did make it in to the movie look like they were stolen from the blair witch project or random shots from the directors backyard the movie somewhat redeemed itself in the end when there was a matrix like shoot out with the clown that we rewound and watched over and over laughing hysterically br br definitely rent this movie if you have ever been snuck up on in an open field br br signed the answer
i recently saw this movie in my international business class i was not expecting anything other then another boring documentary not to say i don't love documentary i've just hard bad luck with movies in that class imagine my surprise when this movie that's actually a movie came up br br this film is a tell all of cultural differences in the work place and how they need to cooperate to get anywhere the culture clash shows just how different the world is and just how differently we perceive ourselves until someone comes along and gives us a wake up call i would highly recommend this film to anyone in business or who just wants a laugh because yes it is funny br br well that's about it cheers
obviously has some talent attached maria bello is always great but this is just a dreary wast of time portraying every character as someone to be loathed and exploited so someone could make a movie out of an 'interesting' story well i hope they got it out of their systems unfortunately for the audience there is no insight no sensitivity no context and really no humanity which would all be fine except it has no humor no horror no context and nothing constructive to say about the story it's trying to tell bad things happen you sit and watch it you don't care so what 99 of the time the words 'based on a true story' constitute an unintentional warning to the audience it means the director and screenwriter are lazy and fascinated by some events they heard about somewhere so they just throw them up on the screen and expect the 'true' nature of the story to make the audience feel something without the filmmakers having to do any of the work i hope they had a great time making this movie it stinks on ice
the greatest sin in life is being dull and this movie is crashingly boring its funny its left out of his a life in film documentary he goes from a long piece on stardust memories and then fast forwards to zelig this little piece of cubic zirconia just isn't worth the effort
too bad a couple of comments before me don't know the facts of this case it is based on actual events a highly publicized disappearance and murder case taking place in the wilmington de philadelphia pa region from '96 through 2000 i have to admit i was highly skeptical of how hollywood would dramatize the actual history and events and was actually quite impressed on how close they stayed to what was constantly reported on local newscasts and philadelphia inquirer news stories throughout the time period of course i immediately pointed out that the actress who i really like in cold case who played fahey looked nothing like her anne marie was actually prettier i have to admit though that mark harmon really nailed the type of personality that was revealed as capano's and the behavior that capano exhibited throughout this period details of the case were right on no deviations of dramatic effect even down to the carpet gun furniture and cooler in conclusion i also wanted to add that i have met tom carper many times at various functions a good man despite being a politician and i am so glad that he pulled the strings in the federal realm necessary to solve this heinous crime guys like capano are real and it was great to see him finally put behind bars
they played this on the july 4th twilight zone marathon and this is hands down the worst twilight zone episode i've ever seen it's completely out of sync with the rest of the series in its tone even though twilight zone is a pretty uneven series and many episodes end up being groaningly predictable this one was completely out of place compare this to legendary episodes like a stop at willoughby or midnight sun and you realize there is no comparison br br buster keaton did what he could with such terrible material and frankly it surprises me that someone of his historic comedy stature would stoop to the level of this episode even though he seemed to be giving it some effort he must have needed the money there's no other explanation
this is one of the most overlooked gems hollywood has ever produced a young wwii british fighter ace whose plane is about to crash has radio contact with a young american woman who comforts the brave pilot knowing that within minutes he will be dead for some reason the man who should certainly be dead walks away from the wreckage and eventually learns that he was meant to report to heaven when a messanger is sent to ask the pilot to accompany him to heaven the man refuses and demands to have his day in court to argue his case the man argues that his situation had changed during the final moments of his earthly life that he had fallen in love and therefor had become a different person one who deserved a chance to live on br br the heavenly court is a cinematic delight the announcement of the jury of peers is a definite highlight the story as fantastic as it seems is an engaging one and will keep you spellbound for the nearly 2 hours play time the final scene is simply beautiful and will require a kleenex treatment for most viewers this film is in my personal all time favorite top 10 it has my highest recommendation
a scientist on an island is in deep sorrow about the loss of his son who died of kidney cancer so he thinks why not turn my dead son into a hammerhead shark well who wouldn't it's a little hard to cope with the fact that the hammerhead shark that's killing everybody is constantly being called paul also william forsythe's cast as a macgyver kick ass savingtheday kinda hero lacks credibility on the other hand there are a few hot chicks who make you actually look at the screen while shark paul bites another one to death as a matter of fact i find bad b movies quite amusing but for my taste it would have been a much better movie if it was made for say 1000000 bucks less then it might have been fun
this film is an entertaining fun and quality film the film very cleverly follows the guidelines if the book and tries to stick to the exact lines the actors are all suitable and you would expect them to be the part they use some famous actors which give a great effect on the film the graphics is a bit dodgy in some parts and there are quite a few mistakes throughout the film there is no such thing as a yellow spotted lizard for example the camp is not as gruesome as explained in the book and they tend not to show the goings on in the camp as much as the book all of his group are mentioned a lot in the book but are not in the film overall a great film for a rainy afternoon
when i am watching a film i am aware that it is just a movie ' but nonetheless i do like to allow myself to become engrossed as much as possible under the circumstances i think this is what makes us cry scream laugh or otherwise react emotionally as audience members even though deep down we know it is just a movie ' what i don't want is for the movie to remind me it is just a movie so that i am unable to slip into the aforementioned engrossment regardless of the quality of the film this film's director chose to frequently use multi angle camera shots simultaneously on the screen maybe it is just me but i find this to be terribly distracting and downright irritating they might as well run a continuous banner across the bottom of the screen reading attention this is just a movie do not allow yourself to become too interested or engrossed' if i want picture in picture' i'll activate it from my tv remote but never during a movie i want to enjoy
for most younger viewers out there they probably have no idea who buster keaton was so because of this they probably won't feel nearly as sad when watching this film as i did i happen to be a silent comedy freak having see just about every keaton film still in existence my being a huge fan made this film very painful from start to finish this is because during his silent days keaton was a very vibrant and creative comedian he was amazing in his physicality and his films were almost never dull however in a move that movie historians still are baffled by at the end of the silent era keaton gave up his independence and became a stock mgm actor instead of being a great creative force mgm now saw keaton solely as an actor and they wrote scripts for him that had no respect for what made him great at first these films with mgm were not that bad such as the cameraman but with talkies the studio really blew it putting him in several films with jimmy durante durante's humor was based on his gift for gab and was abrasive keaton in contrast was quiet and based on action two more unlike and incompatible actors would have been hard to find as a result of this deadly combination keaton made some truly dreadful films br br now this isn't to say that speak easily is a terrible film no instead it's just more of a time passer and an amazingly unfunny one at that in fact if you go into the movie assuming it's a comedy it will probably make the film harder to enjoy instead it's sort of like a drama with a few comedic elements it is not a film that will produce belly laughs especially for keaton fans br br the film begins in an odd setting keaton is cast as a college professor whose entire life is teaching he knows nothing of the world and has his nose stuck in his books in a bizarre move keaton's servant tricks him into believing keaton has received 750 000 from a dead relative hoping that this would spur keaton to get out and enjoy life this is amazingly contrived but somehow it manages to work not terribly well but it works br br keaton immediately leaves school and goes on a journey to new york to have some fun on the way there he meets up with an incredibly untalented theater troop because he knows nothing of the world he doesn't seem to realize they stink and because he thinks he's rich keaton decides to take them all to new york to perform on broadway however just before the show opens his friends find out that keaton is not rich so they decide not to tell keaton and try to keep him away from process servers that want to close the show they assume that if the show is a hit then they can pay off the debts and everyone will be happy however they forget that the show itself stinks what are they to do and will keaton get the nice girl get roped by a gold digger thelma todd or be flat broke and alone if you care see the film br br as for keaton he has few stunts in the film though there are some dandy ones near the end instead keaton just kind of walks through the part in a very subdued manner there's really little to love about this film or hate it's just blah when it should have been a heck of a lot better
really it's a dreadful cheat of a film its 70 minute running time is very well padded with stock footage the rest are non descript exteriors and drab interiors scenes the plot exposition is very poorly rendered they are all just perfunctory scenes sort of strung together there is no attempt at drama in scene selection but rather drama is communicated by the intensity of the actors please don't ask br br the plot concerns a rocket radiating a million degree heat orbiting earth five miles up threatening to destroy the earth it's a real time menace that must be diverted if a custom built h bomb can be fashioned and placed in an experimental rocket within an hour nothing very much here to report except for a mad speech by a scientist against the project because there might be some sort of life aboard and think of the scientific possibilities but this speech made by the obligatory idiot liberal was pretty much passé by then br br what saves this film somewhat uniquely is the stock footage i've never seen a larger selection of fifties jet fighter aircraft in any other film this is by no means a complete list but just some of the aircraft i managed to see there's a brief interception by a pilot flying in alternate shots an f 89 scorpion and an f 86 first to scramble interceptors is the royal canadian air force in hawker hunters and f 86 sabre jets or canadian built cf 13s and even a pair of cf 100 clunks br br then for some reason there are b 52s b 47s and even b36s are seen taking off more padding br br these canadian jets are moving at 1200 miles an hour i don't think so since one of them appears to be a ww2 era gloster meteor the rest f 80s the meteors press the attack and one turns into a late f 84f with a flight of early straight wing f 84s attacking in formation br br there's a strange tandem cockpit version of the f 80 that doesn't seem to be the t 33 training type but some sort of interim all weather interceptor variant with radar in the nose these are scrambled in a snowstorm br br an angled deck aircraft carrier is seen from about 500 meters it launches f 8u crusaders f 11f tigers a 5 vigilantes and a 3 skywarriors the air force scrambles f 86s and f 84s and more f 89s then you've ever seen in your life as well as f 100 super sabres and f 102 delta daggers br br the f 100s press their attack with sooooo much padding the f 89's unload their rockets in their wingtip pods in slo mo the f 86s fire an f 102 lets loose a falcon even some f 80s f 94s with mid wing rocket pods let loose there is a very strange shot of a late model f 84 prototype with a straight wing early model f 85 above it in a turn obviously a manufacturer's republic aviation advertising film showing the differences between the old and the new improved models of the f 84 thunderjet how it strayed into here is anybodies guess br br there is other great stock footage of ottawa in the old days when the capital of canada was a wide spot in the road and especially wonderful footage of new york city's times square during one of the civil defense drills in the early 50s br br i think we also have to deal with the notion that this was filmed in canada with the possible exception of the auto chase seen late in the picture as the pacific seems to be in the background the use of a jowett jupiter is somewhat mind boggling and there is a nice tr 3 to be seen also canada must have been cheap and it is rather gratuitously used a lot in the background br br as far as the actual narrative of the film there is little to recommend it other than the mystery of just who ellen parker is giving the finger to at the end of the picture and she most definitely is flipping someone off could it be r as in robert loggia the director who dies before this film was released her career as this was her last credit br br its like the newspaper the gift came wrapped in was more valuable than the gift
i personally thought the movie was pretty good very good acting by tadanobu asano of ichi the killer fame i really can't say much about the story but there were parts that confused me a little too much and overall i thought the movie was just too lengthy other than that however the movie contained superb acting great fighting and a lot of the locations were beautifully shot great effects and a lot of sword play another solid effort by tadanobu asano in my opinion well i really can't say anymore about the movie but if you're only outlook on asian cinema is crouching tiger hidden dragon or house of flying daggers i would suggest you trying to rent it but if you're a die hard asian cinema fan i would say this has to be in your collection very good japanese film
it occurs to me that some of the films that have been banned during the course of cinema history were actually very important and very good films i'd like to argue that instead of banning challenging controversial movies the censors should consider banning films that are so bad that they pose a threat to your iq and your sanity if they were to do so one of the first films to be quickly hidden away would undoubtedly be stroker ace this film is awful with a capital 'a' it is the worst film burt reynolds ever starred in quite a feat for for a man with cannonball run ii cop and a half and rent a cop on his cv br br the wafer thin story introduces us to successful stock car racer stroker ace reynolds a man who loves fast cars and fast women he gets stuck in a demeaning contract with crooked promoter clyde torkle ned beatty the contract requires him to do some humiliating promotional work for a new chain of fast food restaurants such as dressing up as a giant chicken thrown into the mix are lugs jim nabors ace's dim witted pal and pembrook feeney loni anderson a bimbo with a brain fractionally smaller than a pea who is wooed by ace br br hal needham the director of this low grade garbage was formerly a stuntman and he made numerous films that relied on his expertise in staging spectacular stunts and car chases races some of these films were ok like hooper and stunts unlimited but with stroker ace he reaches a career nadir the characters are so stupid that you actually feel pity for the actors playing them anderson especially is saddled with such a dumb role that it makes you grind your teeth with despair the humour is weak and infantile throughout and the stunts and race sequences are unremarkable even the out takes during the closing credits which can be found in all the reynolds needham collaborations are generally unfunny which gives the impression that maybe the film wasn't much fun to make stroker ace is a stinker of considerable magnitude
this film has got several key flaws the first and most significant of which is the clear lack of a good plot this sadly makes the film not only difficult to watch but also sends the watcher certain feelings of hopelessness as if he or she is wasting valuable time of their short life this means that the film cannot captivate it's audience instead it encourages the viewing public to grow contempt for the film and everything associated with it in short it really is very very very very very very very bad do yourself a favour and chew on a large rubber shoe you'll find it far more interesting and enjoyable than watching terminator woman
nikolai gogol's story viy has been filmed again and released to home video in the us via faith films br br the original story concerns a priest who has to watch over the body of a witch with only his faith to protect him greatly expanded and set in america though clearly filmed in russia the houses clothing and furnishing are all wrong despite the english signs this is an odd film that doesn't really work part of it is the weird setting that tries very hard to be backwoods america but clearly isn't there are also some weird intentionally oblique moments as the main character being a reporter at the start and a priest a short time later i'm not sure why they did that even after watching the making of piece on the dvd the other problem is the dubbing which is beyond awful its done in such away that everyone speaks when their lips are not on camera or if they are the voices don't even remotely match the lip flaps i don't know if its faith films fault or that of the producers who made the film hoping to dump into the west revealed in the making of piece br br the film isn't very good as i've said it has all sorts of technical issues that just make this an odd ball curio despite some really good looking horror images the film never works as a horror film as film to engender faith its much too confused in this retelling to amount to make anyone feel anyone closer to god br br given the choice i'd give it a pass even at a bargain bin price my advice would be to find the 1960's version of the tale called viy which will bring both some shivers and some understanding about a belief in god
this movie is very important because suggested me this consideration sometimes you can wish to be sick sometimes you can wish to have a syndrome sometimes for example you can wish have goldfield syndrome that way you'd not remember this boring movie and above all you'd not remember adam superfluos sandler sometimes simply you can wish have rented another movie br br my vote 3 out of 10 my suggestion if you are neither a fan of boring romantic comedies or adam sandler it's a joke don't exist adam sandler's fan i want to hope it save yourself someone to save drew barrymore perhaps
there is only one use for a film such as bulletproof it reminds you just how bad bad can be we often see films which we describe as pretty awful or not much good but then you come across a film like this and you can see that although all those other films aren't good they are no way as stinkingly bad as bulletproof this was a birthday gift from someone who spent less than two seconds rummaging thru' the dvd bargain bin at our local superstore to fulfil an obligation i e to give me a present it could have been a serendipitous find but it wasn't this is so utterly clichéd so badly written so poorly directed so badly acted that i'm surprised everyone involved hasn't been arrested and sent down for 10 years god it's awful i suspected as much from about 30 seconds in but carried on because sometimes sometimes bad films are so bad they can be enjoyable this isn't one of them it is simply bad i stopped watching after 45 minutes and tomorrow i shall throw it in the bin
this has the logical consistency of marshmallows filled with ketchup and the overall aftertaste is just as disgusting br br will be used in the 9th circle of hell at recreation time just plain torture br br i would rather choose to watch 90 minutes of my computer going through 5400 blue screens of death than watch this appalling drivel again ever horrible horrible horrible br br you know the good thing about swiss cheese is that along with the holes you get some cheese here it's only holes and the excitement factor well that turns watching paint dry into an adrenalin rush and an olympic speed sport br br my brain hurts from trying to work out who ok'd this drivel did they think about the premise i sincerely hope not otherwise there is no redemption the only consolation is they had the pleasure of sitting through the rushes made for tv should not be a synonym for sure let the horses bowels run loose across the living rooms our audience are idiots br br i was hooked just to know how it could get any worse this is not a good sign folks br br hallmark should be ashamed for releasing it br br i should be ashamed for watching it br br i am ashamed i'm off for a long shower
i am a major fan of the horror genre i love horror slasher gore flicks of all kinds some of my favorites are the really good bad horror flicks but this movies has nothing to warrant it's viewing i'm not going to spend a lot of time talking about everything that's wrong with it br br the script is horrid the acting is horrid the fx are not even worth discussing the set is an absolute joke the sad thing is i think there may be some real potential in a couple of the actors but this vehicle left them nothing to work with br br suffice it to say i saw it for free feel i was robbed the time you'd waste watching this would be better spent flossing your cat
i read one other review that expressed the view that platoon was a never ending cycle of marines killing people being killed taking drugs and talking trash br br i don't agree with that because the film actually had more to it but it a way i can see what this person is trying to say this had no real plot which is a point i agree with br br it is self indulgent stone at his best he really wanted to show not only how war leads to death but also how it is extremely traumatic on those who survive unfortunately the film seems to over glorify this aspect and the grand finale is just way too champagne grand standing oscar hunting let's create an enduring image for my liking br br the problem i have with stone and other film makers of his ilk is that they fail to understand this simply concept depicting the terribly bloody deadly waste that war is does not prove or even reflect on whether it was an unjust or immoral war we have seen the same thing emerge at the moment with iraq in case you're missing the point let me put it to you bluntly if you saw how truly bloody the second world war was and how destructive it was on the lives of the surviving soldiers would you think it was an unjust war if that fact alone doesn't convince you that it was an unjust war then why should depictions of the horrors of vietnam convince you that it was wrong to go to war in that instance br br personally i do not support america's decision to go to war in vietnam but i certainly don't subscribe to the this war is wrong because people died and suffered theory i don't think that motivations are always wrong by default just because war in itself is terrible br br this says nothing of the fact that the ending or the final big twist was a bit stupid however this is not stones first oddball departure wall street was a magnificent film up until the last 30 minutes or so when it made a dreadful wrong turn jfk is probably one of the few films stone did that actually ended very well br br but it hardly matters in this one because there was very little plot up until that point of the film to twist around and this is why i gave it such a low mark it was virtually story less and ultimately boring unless you fell for the manufactured poignancy
for this review a list of good points and bad points i'll start with the bad br br bad points the casting choices especially burt reynolds as boss hogg the acting of said badly chosen cast the storyline the idea of setting the film in the modern day the direction the editing the soundtrack and above all the whole idea of making a feature film out of a television series that wasn't that great to start with despite it's popularity br br good points jessica simpson in a red bikini that's it br br one might make an analogy here in the scene where jessica simpson as daisy duke struts her way up to michael weston as enos and asks the question enos where's boss hogg and roscoe in his clouded judgment tells her where they are she might just as well have asked enos is this a good movie the red bikini would have clouded his judgment into saying yes even though in his right mind he would have said no not really as good as she looked in the bikini she could have been stark naked and even that would not have saved this horrible piece of film making stay out of hazzard
descent yeah boy i haven't seen anything this powerful and scintillating since bruno dumont's twentynine palms 2003 by the way this film is not to be confused with another fairly recent pic about the topic of female empowerment the descent 2005 directed by our splat pack friend neil marshall who also happens to be a major talent his own right but getting back to this descent the nc 17 rated uh oh effort on which the lovely ms dawson takes a producer's credit congratulations and directed by talia lugacy strong chance that's not a real name as good as it is in moments it will not be appreciated by most lay people out there because the script is pretty flawed as a producer you really have to tighten up that script of course in the premise alone you have the promise of rising conflict but there still lies the task therein of accomplishing rising conflict br br at times this thing plays like an interesting piece of experimental theater and well i guess i'll let the others who've already commented here speak to the boringness of it namely that which occurs in the second act but find me a second act that isn't boring there's also this catch 22 that goes along with these quasi independent films like descent in which rosario happens to be attaching herself to and leveraging her fame identity to get a script into production that would under usual circumstances not get made at all while at the same time she is basically a miscast in the film's leading role rosario dawson is gorgeous and apparently you can shoot this girl from just about any angle all day long but oh wow wee how fast the time just slips away rosy ain't no undergraduate no more that's part of the confusion about the screenplay is she a graduate student a ta no graduate students don't really have these type of qualms with football players do they again if you are rosario dawson executive producer that's the one of many many aspects to the professional film process you'll have to think about as you embark on this wonderful new role in your film career and if you don't have the answer to why you're movie isn't convincing let me tell you there is a boatload and a bevy of vivacious well qualified undergraduate aged talents pining to get involved in the business who might have nailed that lead character down all the while looking just as darn good as you know who but unfortunately without ms dawson no honey no money i have to say the camera department did an outstanding job however because this film is really well shot i e lit in all its dreary dreamy darkness the nightclub scenes look wonderful one can tell all those music videos are starting to pay off and the play with time the shooting framing is all quite excellent which makes the picture a rewarding watch br br descent is good not great however i have a feeling thanks to netflix this movie will find a life of its own i hope this group continues making films if you're into experimental american film making cinematographic imagery of implausibly well formed college studs or male model drop outs in their early twenties or if you're an undergraduate just plain angry at the hormonally aggressive young men that comprise less than half of your american university rosario dawson's descent might be your flavor of rockaroll
in ten words or less to describe this film barbara stanwyck is too appealing and it is great the film is wonderful except for the perhaps tacked on ending but i love happy endings anyway barbara stanwyck however as the platinum blonde gold digger is amazing she knows what she wants and goes after it this film is sexy and excellent
the film is based on a genuine 1950s novel br br journalist colin mcinnes wrote a set of three london novels absolute beginners city of spades and mr love and justice i have read all three the first two are excellent the last perhaps an experiment that did not come off but mcinnes's work is highly acclaimed and rightly so this musical is the novelist's ultimate nightmare to see the fruits of one's mind being turned into a glitzy badly acted soporific one dimensional apology of a film that says it captures the spirit of 1950s london and does nothing of the sort br br thank goodness colin mcinnes wasn't alive to witness it
i saw this a couple of nights back not expecting too much and unsurprisingly it didn't deliver anything too exciting the plot set up of a crew of vampire hunters v san for vampire sanitation going around in their spaceship periodically killing space vamps and rescuing people is quite sound and had the film been handled better it might well have been something quite ace unfortunately after a fairly decent opening the sense of actual quality starts to drain away from the film leaving something behind that though vacantly watchable is quite laughably bad i don't expect anything too special from these films that pop up on the sci fi channel and at least this wasn't one of their creature features with an atrocious cgi beast shambling about but it was still pretty bad mostly due to the writing and acting but with a sterling contribution to the overall badness made by the horrible music when the film opted just for a typical science fiction sounding weird noises approach to the soundtrack it did ok but all too often hilariously bad soft rock intruded and pitched scenes into silliness i would have tolerated the general cheesy acting and writing more were it not for the choice of music which was a serious miscalculation turning things from cheesy to lamely comical of the acting dominic zamprogna was ok but bland as the nominal hero whilst leanne adachi was pretty irritating as the tough girl of the vamp busting team and aaron pearl played another member who wasn't well written or interesting enough to make an impression though she didn't seem that good at the acting lark natassia malte did well through having a less irritating character than the others and the fact that she is seriously nice to look at the only serious name in the cast is michael ironside and he is underused though he does nicely pretty amusing in a manner one suspects was intentional he seems to have fun and earn his paycheck and his role is entertaining the effects are ok on the whole they are at least of the standards of the average science fiction tv show and there are also a few scenes of blood splatter and a bit of fun gore as well things move along nicely and i almost feel harsh rating this film badly but then i remember bursting into laughter at regular intervals and realising that unless the film is an intentional comedy which i don't think it is then it simply doesn't succeed too much is lame daft unconvincing its an ok effort i guess but it didn't appeal to me only give it a go if you really dig sci fi trash or unintended chuckles i'd say
best of the zorro serials and one of my favorite serials period this is a period serial set right after the birth of mexico the new nation is counting on the gold produced by this one town to keep the republic solvent however a gold god don del oro is stirring up the indians and stealing the gold for himself its zorro and his band of men to the rescue reed hadley is a winning zorro and he cuts a dashing figure as he gets into a nice selection of scraps most all of which were reused by the later zorro serials as well as other serials as well the story moves and its nicely not clear who the real bad guy is there is a reason that i've seen this the most of any serial i've seen its simply a great action adventure film the only thing i can compare it to is the mark of zorro with tyrone power or one of the other swashbucklers of the period its super and highly recommended
and i do mean it if not literally after all i have not seen every movie ever created at least obviously among the ones the many i know br br 5 3 the rule of thumb with imdb is this sometimes movies rated very highly for example the piece of kannes kompetition krowned korean kraap called oldboy can be truly bad but rarely a movie worth watching is actually rated under 6 this movie very much worth watching is a disgrace br br true i give it a 10 in protest the movie is not perfect its true rating should be an 8 or a 9 it has some acting flaws belafonte especially the script wanders around sometimes however what we have here is one of the greatest directors of all times the czech jan kadar directing two of the greatest actors of all time the beloved larger than life zero mostel and the sublime ida kaminska in an acting poetic moral tour de force a pair made in heaven it's true that this movie little flaws apart does not pander to the average audiences but those interested in watching an excellent while again not beyond criticism movie of the incomparable director who gave us the shop on the main street the best movie ever about holocaust should not miss this just because some silly imdb rating system decides that american beauty is better than the angel levine br br it isn't
i didn't even knew this movie existed until shortly after seeing blade trinity i was messing around on the trinity board when i saw some user mention how the wes craven series is a lot better then the 'crap' that's blade so i did my quick research checked the scores on imdb rottentomatoes for dracula ascension and somewhere along the search i found out that this is a sequel to dracula 2000 i also noticed that within the wes craven dracula boards there was a real strong following for this movie which is a big contradiction to the scores i was seeing br br now let's take a quick personal recap here i remember seeing dracula 2000 and i remember not liking it at all and then seeing the scores of dracula ascension just lowered my expectations even more but then again i'm the type of person that truly needs to watch the movie myself any movie so that i can form my own opinion br br a couple of things i went in knowing when i started watching this movie was that it's low budget so because of that i'm going to have to ignore a lot of the v fx and just figure it's going to compensated by story acting i was also slightly impressed by some of the casting in this movie jason london roy schieder jason scott lee br br oh geez this movie was cheesy but cheesy can be entertaining at least i found it pretty fricken laughable the bad audio synch from the re recording of dialogue in a few scenes the stupidity of the characters in this movie sure they all knew about vampires and some of the basic things luke even had a book on it but did it prevent them from wanting to purposely get 'infected' nope this is worst then slasher flicks where the girl has to get out of the shower and check out the noise she hears with nothing more than a towel on br br i also must've blinked at some point because i'm not sure how 'dracula' got clothes on his body especially since he's big wild and angry i figure if i was in that situation i wouldn't want to be the one dressing him br br so the movie ends like any middle movie of a trilogy it doesn't instead it's a 'cliff hangar' where i now get to wait for the 3rd installment 'legacy' oh the entertainment value of cheesy movies
i have one word to someup this movie wow i saw darius goes west at the tribeca film festival people in the theater were sobbing this movie shows the hardships that darius sufferes with muscular dystrophy the movie was very well done and really made you part of the movie i was so emotionally moved by the movie because it made us remember that we are very fortunate to be perfectly healthy some people in this world are less fortuate then us and sometimes we should give them a had and help them to the very end i would give them ten stars they gave darius a had when they weren't asked to they did't do it for the money they did it for a friend in need darius the world should know darius went west
an excellent period murder melodrama with fontaine effectively playing against her earlier naive wallflower type in a role that reportedly olivia dehavilland turned down that's fine because fontaine is wonderful scripted by charles bennett who had written for hitchcock in the thirties and also later penned the excellent script for the classic british horror film night of the demon the opening scene where ivy visits a sinister fortune teller played by the wonderful una o'connor the screecher of james whale fame is a tour de force and the film maintains interest throughout the numerous sinister machinations i hope to see this film on dvd someday but despair of that ever happening because it seems to be an undeservedly obscure film fortunately i got to see it on amc some seven or eight years ago but have not seen since catch it if you can
insisting that martin luther king's inspirational spirit resides not just in american civil liberties but inside the hearts and minds of people everywhere danish helmer niels arden oplev transplants this belief to a 1969 danish middle school more specifically it works its way into the crusade of a young boy named frits janus dissing rathke against his oppressively rigid and churlishly abusive headmaster svendsen bent mejding adapted from a true story the performances are executed with certain aplomb and a refreshing command over its varied characters keeps it involving a battle of ideologies between a 13 year old and a demented disciplinarian gives way to inherent humour but awkward shifts in mood disorients despite keeping it shrewdly cynical in the same vein as a dead poets society more than a matilda it treads a familiar path but a continued and precise service to its young protagonist including a personal subplot that rounds off frits as a young boy becoming a young man manages to raise the film into a rousing family film with its nose right on the money
sergio martino has impressed me recently with his giallo classics 'the strange vice of mrs wardh' and the unforgettably titled 'your vice is a locked room and only i have the key' but even so i wasn't expecting too much from this film the case of the scorpion's tail doesn't get mentioned as much as the aforementioned titles when it comes to classic giallo discussion but i don't know why because this is at least as good as those two dario argento may be the 'king' of giallo but with the five films that he made sergio martino surely isn't too far behind in some ways he even surpasses the master all of martino's films were released prior to the jewel in argento's crown the magnificent profondo rosso so back in the early seventies martino was the king the plot here follows the idea of murder for profit and follows the insurance payout of a wealthy man his wife inherits 1 million and it isn't long before there's people out for her blood when she turns up dead shortly thereafter an insurance investigator and a plucky attractive young journalist follow up the case br br the case of the scorpion's tail may not benefit from the beautiful edwige fenech but it does have two of martino's collaborators on board most famous is george hilton who worked with marino on the strange vice of mrs wardh and all the colors of the dark along with a number of other giallos hilton has a great screen presence and every time i see him in an italian thriller it becomes obvious why he is repeatedly cast the beautiful anita strindberg who will be remembered from your vice is a locked room stars alongside hilton and excellently provides the classic giallo female lead sergio martino does a good job in the director's chair once again with several beautiful scenes the best of which taking place in a room bathed with green lighting the score by bruno nicolai wardh excellently sets the mood but it is the script that once again is the driving force behind martino's success ernesto gastaldi the writer for martino's other four giallo has put together a script that is thrilling while staying away from the common giallo pitfall of not making sense thus liberating this film from the rest of the illogical genre the case of the scorpion's tail is a quality giallo film and yet another success for the great sergio martino if you like giallo you'll love this
elizabeth ward gracen who will probably only be remembered as one of bill clinton's bimbo eruptions they have pills for that now is probably the weakest element of this show it really continues the tired formula of the highlander series the hero immortal encounters another immortal with flashbacks about the last time they met but there is some conflict and there is a sword fight at the end where you have a cheap special effects sequence br br then you have the character of nick wolf basically your typical unshaven 90's hero with the typical sexual tension storyline seriously why do you hollywood types think sexual tension is more interesting than sex this was a joint canadian french production so half the series takes place in vancouver imitating new york and the other half is in paris just like highlander did
lauren bacall and charles boyer do not provide the right chemistry here in this 1945 film br br there is a good story here about the axis trying to obtain coal to use for the upcoming war unfortunately this part of the story is not emphasized instead we deal with a supposedly bungling boyer by the way bacall is as british as vladimir putin br br the real acting kudos goes to veteran oscar winner katina paxinou as was the case with her memorable pilar in the 1943 oscar winner for whom the bell tolls paxinou again plays a spanish revolutionary but this time she is a double crossing counter spy for the pro franco group she is quite a vicious character here especially when she throws a 14 year old child out the window she believed that boyer had given the child important material to hide
this movie is just plain dumb br br from the casting of ralph meeker as mike hammer to the fatuous climax the film is an exercise in wooden predictability br br mike hammer is one of detective fiction's true sociopaths unlike marlow and spade who put pieces together to solve the mystery hammer breaks things apart to get to the truth this film turns hammer into a boob by surrounding him with bad guys who are well too dumb to get away with anything one is so poorly drawn that he succumbs to a popcorn attack br br other parts of the movie are right out of the three stooges play book velda's dance at the barre for instance or the bad guy who accidentally stabs his boss in the back and the continuity breaks are shameful frau blucher is running down the centerline of the road when the camera is tight on her lower legs but she's way over the side when the camera pulls back for a wider shot the worst break however precedes the popcorn attack the bad guy stalking hammer passes a clock seconds after our hero except the clock shows he was seven minutes behind our guy br br to be fair there were some interesting camera angles and lighting and the grand finale is so bad that it must been seen which is the only reason that it gets two points out of 10
how can you take her hard living glamorously violent bounty hunter story serious with that accent it's absurd apart from that the visual style of the directer is nauseating and gimmicky the plot is a shallow boring confused gangster movie rehash and the acting is unconvincing the film introduces new characters all the way throughout the film and is told in fragmented flashback mostly out of sequence seemingly just to keep you nice and confused the film ever shows you things that don't really happen and then later says that didn't really happen this happened see the apparent killing of the fake 'first ladies' what have we seen the first wrong sequence of events for then br br terrible choice in casting a convoluted messy plot and a headache inducing directorial style 1 5
i cannot stop saying how much i loved this movie this movie is one of the least known and one of the funniest movies i have ever seen the movie follows the exploits of a rap group nwh ni rs with hats it goes from the beginning of the group to the end of the group after it's tragic break up following the group is documentary maker nina blackburn br br the movie is on a shoestring budget but it does not seem to matter this is a very well made well produced film and the performances by all of these actors and actresses are excellent the main strength of this movie is the writing there are so many brilliant lines and takeoffs on rap in this movie it is unreal br br spoiler br br there are takeoffs on actual rappers like mc slammer vanilla sherbert ice cold tone def tastey taste and songs booty juice grab your dick etc rusty condieff has made an excellent film in the movie he plays rapper ice cold the movie does not quit it is funny from the beginning to the end br br the movie works so well because it becomes outlandish on occasion but it strikes that line where it is funny without going too far out there listening to the three leads try to talk some kind of philosophy was one of the best parts of the movie like tone def telling a record producer when you take the bus you get there' and the producer responding that's deep ' br br the group portraying n w h has some sort of natural chemistry to them they work so well together and they manage to pull this movie of to where there is not a week moment in the film what really makes this movie so good is how true to some of the rap groups of the time this movie is many rap groups had problems with violence with censors and like nwa the group only became popular when the establishment began to make a big deal out of the controversial lyrics br br i like this movie because it is offensive there is something here to offend everyone in a good natured way the movie has a takeoff on a good number of people too outside of rap the funniest being of spike lee where they came up with this dialogue i cannot imagine the movie has line after line that will have you rolling on the floor as i said before the writing is just excellent br br i am not surprised that this movie met such limited release it is an intelligent controversial and even thought provoking film this is too much for mainstream despite the fact it is hilarious and nearly flawless in it's production there are no major stars but a lot of familiar faces including marc lawrence who plays tone def watch this movie at the very least you will definitely have an opinion of it
let me start by saying that i totally agree with the basic thesis of the film that there probably was no historical jesus and christianity is a sham with that said this movie does a pretty poor job of proving that thesis it makes good arguments the gap between jesus' theoretical life and the writing of the gospels filled only by the writings of paul who doesn't indicate a historical jesus and then utterly fails to convincingly argue them it makes broad statements without presenting the evidence the statements are based on and it resolutely ignores counter arguments presented by christian apologists the intellectual dishonesty emotional manipulation and lack of serious argument are obvious and stunning the only christians we hear from in the film are the head of the filmmaker's old school who comes off like a reasonable rational person attempting to deal with a twit with a chip on his shoulder and various christians encountered apparently at random in a parking lot i'm sorry but revealing that average christians don't know much about their religion isn't exactly damning evidence of christianity's fraudulence you may as well claim that jay leno has disproved the existence of michael dukakis on his jay walking segment the interviews with experts can be interesting but the film is filled with too much of let's be honest the filmmaker just being snarky within the first five minutes the film has already conflated jerry falwell with charles manson and the writers of the left behind series with the branch davidians and by the end the film becomes so self centered that there's no rational argument left just an angry former christian lashing out at the people and places he blames for his messed up childhood y'know maybe that movie could've been interesting but it's misplaced in a documentary about the historicity of jesus and it's so self congratulatory as to deflate any sympathy this is a michael moore film without the humor or the film making acumen combined with a richard dawkins book without the wit or the intellectual rigor skip it
come undone appears to elicit a lot of opinions among the contributors to this forum granted it's a film that promises a take on gay life as most viewers expect and somehow it gets away from that promise into an introspective view at a young man's soul the film has a way of staying with us even when it has ended it is a character study about how a young man gets involved into a love affair with someone so much different than him that in the end will leave mathieu confused hurt and depressed when things don't go according to what he hoped the relationship would be br br if you haven't seen the film perhaps you would like to stop reading br br sebastien lifshitz the director of the film has told his story from mathieu's viewpoint most viewers appear to be disoriented by the different times within the film but there are hints that are not obvious as one can see in retrospect the story is told in flashbacks that might add to the way some people will view the film this is a story about the doomed the love mathieu felt for cedric and the ultimate breakdown of their life together br br first of all cedric the handsome young local pursues mathieu until he succeeds in convincing him he likes him mathieu feels the attraction for cedric too we realize how different both young men are by the way cedric tells mathieu's family how he feels school is not for him on the other hand mathieu who wants to be an architect finds beauty in the abandoned place where cedric has taken him we watch as mathieu reading from the guide book wants cedric's attention br br when mathieu comes out to his mother she wisely tells him about the importance of continuing his career she also points out about what future both of them would have together which proves to be true mathieu appears to have learned his lesson the hard way he goes on to an uncertain life with cedric and attempts to take his own life we watch him in the hospital speaking to a psychiatrist that has treated his wounded soul br br the ending might be confusing for most viewers but there is a moment in the film when mathieu goes to work in a bar where we see him washing glasses and looking intently to pierre the young man who frequents the bar that is why when mathieu goes looking for pierre at his house appears to be hard to imagine yet we have seen the way mathieu is obviously interested in pierre the last scene at the beach when pierre and mathieu are seen strolling in the sand has a hopeful sign that things will be better between them as they watch a young boy apparently lost but then realizing the father is nearby br br jeremie elkaim makes mathieu one of the most complex characters in recent films this is a young man who is hard to understand on a simple level mathieu has suffered a lot first with the separation of his parents then with his depressed mother and with losing cedric stephan rideau who has been seen on other important french films is equally good as the shallow cedric br br while come undone will divide opinions the film deserves a viewing because of the complexity and the care sebastien lifshitz gives to the story
dick clement and ian la frenais have a solid hit rate as far as their tv work is concerned however their film work has been much more chequered 2008's the bank job was fine the previous year's across the universe decidedly weak for instance br br still crazy fortunately is a solid success it has a great story excellent performances a lot of humour fabulous music and above everything else real heart br br i savour moments and this film has one of them just when everything is going pear shaped at the festival reunion performance br br hugely enjoyable
le grand voyage is a gentle miracle of a film a work made more profound because of its understated script by writer director ismaël ferroukhi who allows the natural scenery of this 'road trip' story and the sophisticated acting of the stars nicolas cazalé and mohamed majd to carry the emotional impact of the film ferroukhi's vision is very capably enhanced by the cinematography of katell djian a sensitive mixture of travelogue vistas of horizons and tightly photographed duets between characters and the musical score by fowzi guerdjou who manages to maintain some beautiful themes throughout the film while paying homage to the many local musical variations from the numerous countries the film surveys br br reda nicolas cazalé lives with his muslim family in southern france a young student with a western girlfriend who does not seem to be following the religious direction of his heritage his elderly father mohamed majd has decided his time has come to make his hadj to mecca and being unable to drive requests the reluctant reda to forsake his personal needs to drive him to his ultimate religious obligation the two set out in a fragile automobile to travel through france into italy and on through bulgaria croatia slovenia and turkey to saudi arabia along the trip reda pleads with his father to visit some of the interesting sights but his father remains focused on the purpose of the journey and reda is irritably left to struggle with his father's demands on their pilgrimage they encounter an old woman ghina ognianova who attaches herself to the two men and must eventually be deserted by reda a turkish man mustapha jacky nercessian who promises to guide the father son duo but instead brings about a schism by getting reda drunk in a bar and disappearing and countless border patrol guards and custom agents who delay their progress for various reasons tensions between father and son mount reda cannot understand the importance of this pilgrimage so fraught with trials and mishaps and the father cannot comprehend reda's insensitivity to the father's religious beliefs and needs at last they reach mecca where they are surrounded by hoards of pilgrims from all around the world and the sensation of trip's significance is overwhelming to reda the manner in which the story comes to a close is touching and rich with meaning it has taken a religious pilgrimage to restore the gap between youth and old age between son and father and between defiance and acceptance of religious values br br the visual impact of this film is extraordinary all the more so because it feels as though the camera just 'happens' to catch the beauty of the many stopping points along the way without the need to enhance them with special effects nicolas cazalé is a superb actor be sure to see his most recent and currently showing film 'the grocer's son' and it is his carefully nuanced role that brings the magic to this film another fine film from the film movement this is a tender story brilliantly told highly recommended br br grady harp
this film is easily one of the worst ones i have ever seen and i don't mean that in a good way we wanted to see a crappy horror thriller so we picked the one that seemed to be the lousiest in the store for once the film was everything we'd expected and more or should i say less br br the actors look like they are reading their lines from posters behind the camera the so called special effects are created by putting red see through plastic in front of the camera to give the impression that we are seeing through the eyes of the killer rats and the script don't even get me started on the script and just when you thought it couldn't get any worse it turns out that the first part of the film was oscar material compared to the ending br br take it from me this film is hilarious if you're into crappy horror films but if you want a good film keep on looking this is not for you
what can you possibly say about a show of this magnitude the sopranos has literally redefined television as we know it it has broken all rules and set new standards for television excellence everything is flawless the writing directing and for me most of all the acting watching this show you'll find yourself realizing that these characters are not real the acting tricks you into thinking there is a real tony soprano or any character this show is also very versatile some people don't watch the show because it's violent it's not all about the violence it's about business family and many deeper things that all depend on what you as a fan see for me i don't like when people refer to the show a show about the mafia for me it's a show about family a family who through generations happen to be apart of the mob overall this is a masterpiece of a show this is what television should be right here complex characters from stunning acting magnificent story lines from brilliant writing and what do you get when you mix these ingredients together a show that defines excellence and dares to be different
the story idea behind the lost missile isn't bad at all but unfortunately the story does get a bit dull towards the middle and the overuse of stock footage as well as poor special effects sink this film to the sub par level br br the film begins with a missile heading towards the earth in a panic because it's about to strike the earth the soviets manage to deflect the object this isn't necessarily good however as this seemingly unmanned craft has a vapor trail that destroys everything in its path and the ship is now in a low orbit over the planet in other words with each pass it makes a swath of death follows one that could potentially kill us all so it's up to the good scientists of the us led by a very young and hardly recognizable robert loggia to formulate and plan to save us and especially save new york that is in its immediate flight path unfortunately they aren't able to save ottawa i've never been there so i can't say whether or not this is a big loss but thanks to good old american know how they are able to eventually destroy this harbinger of destruction br br so as you can see the story idea isn't bad and rather original but so many old clips of fighter planes and guys manning radar scopes gets a bit old and it seemed like padding overall a decent but hardly inspired film that extreme fans of the genre may like all others see it at your own risk
i spied this short on a dvd of best new zealand shorts all great but the french doors was amazing it starts off slow and you wonder if there is anything going to happen just as you relax into the hum drum of home renovation the most spookiest thing happens br br eeeekkk i wanted to stop watching but i was glued br br the films dips into the primal fear of the dark and with little if not any special effects it chills you right to the bone a simple yet brilliant concept opened up all those memories of when i was young and dream't up the most improbably but spooky situations br br the film makers visual style are bang on and the lead character takes you convincingly through the story it is a quality short that i haven't seen in quite some time br br the french doors has all the hallmarks of a great feature alas it finishes after ten minutes or so never the less a great ending that begs you to want to know more br br loved it and well done and thanks for the ride these new zealanders are really turning out the talent br br a new fan
this 2004 oscar nominee is a very short b w film in spanish a young woman goes into a café gets a coffee and notices a couple of musicians standing silently with their instruments all the patrons are motionless like mannequins one guy however is quite jolly and breaks into a song about what goes on at 7 35 in the morning there is one surprising moment after another until the end which is quite well surprising the people the place everything looks quite ordinary and like the musical piece bolero the thing keeps building until the climax with its structure theme movement and wit it is an 8 minute masterpiece
5 minutes into this movie i was hyperventilating shaking and writhing in pain and not in the good way the story is about a troupe of idiotic children making prank phone calls to a psycho which is always a good idea turns out psychos don't like prank phone calls because in 2 minutes time he's at their door killing poor williams mom and dad well skip ahead 15 years and guess what still prank phone calling people yep you would of thought that a horrible murder would of deterred them from doing that ever again but no so after about two hours later and way too many scream ripoffs i realized that this movie gave me nothing but a terrible taste in my mouth and a severe urge to take my own life this piece of crap isn't even worth laughing at the shoddy production the acting or rutger haurs dwindling career i love crappy horror movies but this is the most unsatisfying piece i've ever seen just don't
burlinson and thornton give an outstanding performance in this movie along with dennehy although it is at first thought to be only about love it really goes down deeper than that the beauty of nature captures this movie placing among one of the best i have ever seen the horse scenes are absolutely fantastic any horse lovers out there will love this movie br br
lillian hellman's play adapted by dashiell hammett with help from hellman becomes a curious project to come out of gritty warner bros paul lukas reprising his broadway role and winning the best actor oscar plays an anti nazi german underground leader fighting the fascists dragging his american wife and three children all over europe before finding refuge in the states via the mexico border they settle in washington with the wife's wealthy mother and brother though a boarder residing in the manor is immediately suspicious of the newcomers and spends an awful lot of time down at the german embassy playing poker it seems to take forever for this drama to find its focus and when we realize what the heart of the material is the wise honest direct refugees teaching the clueless head in the sand americans how the world has suddenly changed it seems a little patronizing the viewer is quite literally put in the relatives' place being lectured to lukas has several speeches in the third act which undoubtedly won him the academy award yet for the much of the picture he seems to do little but enter and exit enter and exit as his spouse bette davis enunciates like nobody else and works her wide eyes to good advantage but the role doesn't allow her much color their children all with divergent accents are alternately humorous and annoying and geraldine fitzgerald has a nothing role as a put upon wife and the disgruntled texture she brings to the part seems entirely wrong the intent here was to tastefully tactfully show us just because a wwii era man may be german that doesn't make him a nazi sympathizer we get that in the first few minutes the rest of this tasteful tactful movie is made up of exposition defensive confrontation and ultimately compassion it should be a heady mix but instead it's rather dry eyed and inert from
a stale misfits in the army saga which half heartedly attempts to be both surreal the foreign subtitles and vulgar the flatulence gags but just ends up being a mix of many different kinds of humor none of them followed very successfully barbara bach the bond girl from the spy who loved me has only two or three brief scenes what a waste 1 2
oliver hardy awakens with a hangover and soon learns that his uncle is coming to see ollie's new wife and baby the problem is they don't exist ollie apparently made them up so it's up to him and his pal to locate a lady with a baby who will agree to pose as his family br br this isn't a particularly unique story idea as i've seen at least a couple other silent shorts with this exact plot the best of these was bobby vernon's don't kid me it is much better than one too many probably much of this was due to it being made a decade later when comedy became a bit more sophisticated and relied less on pointless slapstick now i am not against physical comedy but in some slapstick films people starting shooting guns wildly kick and strangle each other etc with little provocation sadly at the end of one too many that's exactly what they do none of it makes sense and it was as if they'd just run out of story ideas br br overall not exactly a milestone in entertainment there's just not enough payoff to merit watching it unless you are an obsessive silent fan like myself
almost too well done john carpenter's vampires was entertaining a solid piece of popcorn entertainment with a budget small enough not to be overrun by special effects and obviously aiming on the from dusk till dawn audience vampires los muertos tries the same starting with a rock star jon bon jovi playing one of the main characters but does that almost too well i haven't seen jon bon jovi in any other movie so i am not able to compare his acting in vampires los muertos to his other roles but i was really suprised of his good performance after the movie started he convinced me not expecting him to grab any guitar and playing it' my life or something but kill vampires showing no mercy and doing a job which has to be done this means a lot because a part of the audience also me was probably thinking just because he's a rockstar of course bon jovi is not james woods but to be honest it could have been much worse and in my opinion bon jovi did a very good performance the vampiress played by arly jover is not the leather dressed killer machine of a vampire leader we met in part 1 or in similar way in ghosts of mars jover plays the vampire very seductive and very sexy moving as lithe as a cat attacking as fast as a snake and dressed in thin light almost transparent very erotic cloth and even the optical effects supporting her kind of movement are very well made it really takes some beating but the director is in some parts of the film only just avoiding turning the movie from an action horrorfilm into a sensitive horrormovie like murnau's nosferatu you can almost see the director's temptation to create a movie with a very personal note and different to the original this is the real strength of the movie and at the same time its weakest point the audience celebrating the fun bloodbath of the first movie is probably expecting a pure fun bloodbath for the second time and might be a little disappointed make no mistake vampires los muertos is a fun bloodbath but it's just not all the time this kind of movie just think of the massacre in the bar compared to the scene in which the vampiress tries to seduce zoey in the ruins the bar massacre is what you expect from american popcorn entertainment the seducing zoey in the ruins scene is almost european like cinema the movie is eager to tell us more about the relationship between zoey and the vampiress but refuses answers at the same time because it would had slow down the action showed the audience a vampiress with a human past a now suffering creature and not only a beast which is just slaughtering anybody and that's the point to me which decides whether the movie is accepted by the audience of the original movie or not and also is the from dusk till dawn audience really going to like this i'm not sure about that nevertheless tommy lee wallace did really a great job vampires los muertos is surprisingly good but i also think to direct a sequel of a popcorn movie wallace is sometimes almost too creative too expressive like he's keeping himself from developing his talent in order to satisfy the expectations of audience in my opinion wallace' talent fills the movie with life and is maybe sometimes sucking it out at the same time vampires los muertos is almost too well done i give it 7 of 10
oh my goodness this was a real big mess that just couldn't help itself jeffrey jon heder is a 29 year old man still living with his mum diane keaton and not planning on going anywhere until his mother meets a rich businessman named mert jeff daniels who she may be getting married to br br it would have been an ok movie if heder didn't play his jeffrey so annoying from the very start there is no chance of liking him and it only gets worse and worse in the end we are supposed to like him but there was no reason to as he hadn't changed from the selfish brute that he was at the beginning of the movie br br keaton doesn't look to even be trying and is in horrible form after 2007's because i said so not to mention the shocking chemistry between heder and keaton and where supposed to believe that their mother and son the only saving grace is jeff daniels and anna faris although they don't look very interested either apart from a few little smiles this film really doesn't deserve to be called a comedy simply because there is barely anything to laugh at if your in the mood for a recent diane keaton flick watch mad money or smother which are a lot better than this abysmal effort
i only wish that return of the jedi have been directed by somebody else i mean there is far too much ewoks scenes completely unnecessary besides this time our heroes look like different people princess leia no longer fights with solo luke looks boring darth vader is not as evil as before and yoda just dies br br but there are many extraordinary things going on this episode that i just can't hate it br br some spoilers 1 jabba the hut 2 the sail barge attack sequence 3 the emperor now that's evil 4 the speeders chase at the endor forest 5 the last battle 6 the dark side seduction scene 7 the return of anakin to the good side of the force 8 and the last celebration br br some of those are so good that they can bring tears to your eyes if some scenes would have been cut and another director was hired this would have been as perfect as episode 4 and 5 but still is extraordinary 9 out of 10
this is a well made informative film in the vein of pbs frontline the problem is frontline already did this piece and managed to bring l paul bremer in to tell his side of the story more troubling is the fact that the director of the film charles ferguson a former think tank wonk was a war supporter until the occupation went south what did he think would happen br br the invasion of poland went really well too until it was messed up by those pesky nazis and that is what this film feels like an apology for occupation rather than a deconstruction of the act of war itself br br ferguson seems to suggest that the war could have been run better as if any war can be better
when you are in a gloomy or depressed mood go watch this film it shows a lot of beauty and joy in a very simple everyday setting and it is very encouraging in particular from a feminist and a humanist perspective br br when you know both the turkish language and either the danish or the german language go watch the film in any case half of the dialog is danish in the original synchronized to german in the translated version the other half turkish subtitled in danish or german respectively when i watched it in mannheim germany the reaction of the turkish speaking audience proved that there must be a lot of humor in the turkish dialog which deplorably mostly escaped me being only imperfectly rendered in the subtitles still the film is interesting even if you lack knowledge of the turkish br br esthetically the movie is playing a lot on the theme of speed and slowness on first sight there is lots of corporeal movement fast as lightning making it a quick an agitated film in particular even though this is a kung fu movie watch out for the running scenes beautifully expressing a wealth of emotions but there are quite a few very slow emotionally intense scenes too and above all the characters develop at a much slower pace than you would expect in a drama about the coming of age still there is some movement in the characters to closely watch the villain omar whose part and acting i liked very much br br the contrast of speed and stillness nicely contributes to the depiction of human rage and dignity shown at once in the same characters at the same time
robin williams does his best to combine comedy and pathos but comes off a bit shrill donald moffat is too one note as his father in law jeff bridges is excellent though as the quarterback and holly palance and pamela reed are marvelous carrying the film through most of its rough spots it fills time nicely but is little more than that
unfortunately spacecamp came out about the same time as the challenger explosion which really put a crimp on when to bring it out or even if they should bring it out i'm glad they did i first watched spacecamp at a drive in movie which really enhanced the viewing a lot br br while i had heard of lea thompson and tom skerritt i had never heard of the others in the movie so it came as a big shock to me to find all those youngsters acting and acting real good of course kate capshaw was excellent too br br i especially liked the scenes where those kids were being shown how to act as a team the scenes of the kids being prepared for a trip they could only hope for the actual launch of a spacecraft is of course old news to us however this one was different br br all in all this is one of my most treasured films escapist maybe but it was fantastic for a space nut like me after probably renting it for 30 40 times i finally found it available in a certain store and bought it now if it only comes out on dvd i will probably have it forever this movie gets a 9 out of 10 from me
with this movie being the only dirty harry movie which clint eastwood not only stars but produces and directs as well you know it's got to be good although some say that the enforcer is the best out of the series i completely disagree in my opinion apart from the original dirty harry sudden impact and magnum force are the only two worthy of being in the series although the enforcer is an alright film with a couple of good action sequences it doesn't get the dirty and gritty impact that the other three films do this film captures all the excitement that makes a clint eastwood film good and it's got the quotes that make a dirty harry film good in diry harry it's well do ya punk in magnum force a man's got to know his limitations and in this it's go ahead make my day also in this film it's nice to see a change of scenery as you get a bit tired of seeing the same old san fransisco streets in the other films in the series with great acting by clint eastwood and co star sandra locke and good directing by clint this is in my opinion the best dirty harry sequel ever
being a fan of andy goldsworthy's art for a while now and owning some of his books i had some expectations of what i would see what i got was something completely satisfying and quite a bit more than i expected being an artist myself i work in clay finding inspiration within our surroundings to make good art is imperative and it is something andy goldsworthy has mastered following him over the course of a year the director captures the spontaneous energy skill and devotion to the artists connection with nature with dratic inspiring flair the music set to the film is embracing and intoxicating if you are an artist in need of inspiration or anyone else in need of an uplifting experience then see this movie i for one am glad to know that andy is somewhere out there creating dancing wrestling with the forces of nature to make our world more beautiful
i like a lot of the actors actresses involved in this project so being insulted by the movie felt even worse than if they used a unknowns the main problem was this movie was clearly just a concept created to appeal to baby boomers in 20 or 30 years nbc will probably do a movie just like this about the early 90's i can see it now a black family where the kids are involved with the la riot's and the white family has the kids rebel and listen to grunge rock music the soundtrack will feature bands like nirvana n w a public enemy soundgarden etc the movie like this will be just as cheesy as the 60's and i gurantee you nbc will do it see the biggest problem with period pieces when done buy networks is that when you are living in a certain time period you aren't thinking i am living in the 60's or whatever decade is trendy retro at the time next time someone does something like this they should put more weight into there project
this movie was absolute torture first of all it's a whopping 4 hours long true the kargil war may have had several points that were captured and fought for but every single one of those battles need not have been shown so maybe this is a documentary not a commercial film as advertised sure didn't seem like it as enough background information was not given and there were some flaws the battle sequences were so poorly executed i am terribly disappointed from the man who gave well done sequences in border each battle was the exact same as the previous it was so predictable this might be a spoiler the whole army marches uphill five or so soldiers curse five thousand times each they also use the same cussword every time one of the lead actors is shot someone yells for a stretcher the actor says no don't get a stretcher that will take 6 men from the battalion and then an actor dies that exact same thing happens over and over and over again oh and the songs are so bad and so long the cast of the movie is too big for its own good despite such a long movie none of the characters were well developed the actresses had the most miniscule roles they all are dressed and portrayed to be the same two of them were weeping synchronized it was so comical they moved their hands and heads at the exact same time and then bit their dupatta together br br the list just goes on and on i know i'm still forgetting something anyways i think i have bashed the film enough that you get the picture
i know that you've already entered this in film festivals or at least i think you have i may just be making that up but i think this should get best animated short film in every one bravo i can't wait for the full film i realize that you may not hear this often enough because of the bizarre nature of your animations but hear it now and accept it as the truth kudos my friend okay now i'm just trying to get ten lines of text though i still mean it and here comes yet another shoe and i cannot stop here yet this is extremely annoying and yet at the same time i have nothing better to do in fact i'll probably watch all of your movies in yet another spasmodic jason steele marathon i do have a lot of those br br r
the only aspect of this film that saves it from being my least favorite piece of celluloid trash is a single line uttered by an agent attempting to infiltrate the man eating tomatoes by dressing in a tomato costume can somebody please pass the ketchup i highly urge anyone with a sleeping disorder to use this film as a sedative it works better than an overdose of demarol
five years after the original creepshow another inferior horror sequel is penned by george a romero and stephen king creepshow 2 this time there are only three stories instead of five none of the three stories is really original or distinguished either the first story is a horror staple formulaic story about a wooden indian statue seeking revenge against the killers of its owners the effects are really neat in this story but it's just too familiar to be compelling enough george kennedy and dorothy lamour play the elderly store owners the second story the raft is a stephen king story it's about four teenagers that unwittingly spend the day on a wooden pallet in the middle of an isolated lake soon the kids are screaming for their lives as a watery blob does each of them in for no apparent reason however instead of being suspenseful the kids are saddled with bad dialog and dopey headed behavior preventing us from really caring about what happens next there is also some unintentional humor in this segment the third and final story is the hitch hiker which is actually a retread re adapted for creepshow 2 the original story by lucille fletcher was filmed in 1953 as a film noir suspense film then it was adapted for a famous twilight zone episode featuring inger stevens the hitch hiker works the best out of these three offerings but it's not without its problems either lois chiles plays a cheating spouse who ends up running over a hitch hiker or so she thinks however we don't know whether to sympathize with her or condemn her as in many average stories of this type the characters exist merely to tell the stories with their twists and turns the wrap around story with the bullies seems a bit out of place tom savini appears as the creep in this installment the good thing is there haven't been any more sequels 1 2 of 4 stars
sure it had some of the makings of a good film the storyline is good if a bit bland and the acting was good enough though i didn't understand why olivia d'abo had such a pronounced australian accent if her character was supposed to have been raised in the us my biggest problem however was with the wardrobe i know as rule the average american is considered a frumpy dresser by any self respecting european but this was beyond that anna's colour combinations were positively ghastly and that potato sack like sad excuse for a coat she wore throughout the film made me break out in hives i suppose the idea was to be as realistic as possible how many school teachers walk around in prada but simple doesn't mean an absolute lack of taste a word to the wise
this is one of those movies that i've seen so many times that i can quote most of it some of the lines in this movie are just unbeatable i particularly enjoy watching him stumble and fall while drunk go out to the fancy restaurant drunk and the part with the moose br br i don't know how many times i have seen this sequence but it's funny every time from the moment arthur gets to susan's dad's place to the bit with the moose you pretty much laugh the whole time i remember watching the out takes regarding the bit with the moose it went down just like i'd imagined it'd be like they were all laughing so hard it was difficult for them to film it br br the late sir john gielgud was a wonderful addition to this his demeanor his one liners and the way he handled arthur were all equally hilarious it's always a funny moment when he whacks him over the head with his hat or tells him he's a spoiled little i laugh every time i listen to the i'm going to have a bath and the lines that follow
the summer of 1979 when this flick was a staple on that new movie medium called hbo was gas line summer iranian hostage crisis summer a change of mood was about to end low budget loner on a mission car films although smokey the bandit kept need for speed flicks going as live action roadrunner cartoons for a few more years corvette summer is as quirky as any earlier movie like vanishing point or dirty mary crazy larry if lighter sexier than most just graduated high school automotive genius kenneth hamill hitchhikes to vegas in pursuit of the car theft ring that ripped off his shop class masterpiece a super custom right hand drive vette in the spiritual limbo of the i 15 desert see fear loathing in las vegas he gets into a custom van yes this was the tail end of the van craze too tricked out as a mobile bordello driven by sassy aspiring hooker vanessa potts on her way to sin city to make her well whatever it is ambitious hookers make vanessa get it shy innocent kenneth is in way over his head in vegas with only his all american resolve his new friend to help him although the hard edged young call girl is predictably less world wise than she first seems why in the i am woman age vanessa invested her talents money future in the world's oldest but least dignified profession over say college or even hairdressing can be explained by young men who'd like to think that all women at least consider the joys of that career path remember the target audience right hamill is a good choice for the whitebread kenneth the car doesn't even belong to him personally but to his school who won't be deterred from his goal by violence money or even love until he finds out why the car was really stolen potts acts with style energy but vanessa is too incredible for any but the most credulous testosterone machine to buy into the bad guys are made surprisingly human especially by the always fine brion james but there's not much action this isn't the kind of movie that can be carried by dialog plot twists or heavy themes you could always reach up turn the tv dial plug in your pong console the similar but meaner chris mitchum vehicle stingray which appeared at about the same time featured lamer acting but more skin speed mayhem the best features of each film might have produced a vette movie worth remembering thus the trans am was left to rule the box office muscle car showroom another forgotten car movie brought back from the dead by speed channel's fine weekend series lost drive in
jiøí trnka made his last animated short an indictment of totalitarism which caused him trouble in his native czechoslovakia the elements are few the symbolisms simple and his trademark ornaments almost absent here allowing the viewer to concentrate on the fable a man in his room dedicates to pottery and to take care of his only plant but suddenly a huge hand enters the room and orders him to make a statue of itself the man refuses and he's persecuted by the ominous gloved hand in these days where the impression of reality factor seems to be erased from most animations that try to replace the real world it is refreshing to watch a film which makes its technique part of the enjoyment
a light hearted comedy nothing shows us a world that we sometimes wish to escape to a world of nothing anything you don't like be it a stack of bills a bad memory or even hunger can disappear at your wish they approached this movie very well and with an enjoyable starring duo there were only a few things i didn't like about nothing and they weren't even part of the main movie br br first the post credits scene and yes there is one good for a chuckle but what were they trying to accomplish with that i was confused and eager to see a return to something after a whole movie of nothing instead we just hear a random assortment of noises and they scream it tries to set up a sequel in my opinion and wasn't really necessary nor was it funny after the turtle crawled out of frame br br second the trailer i saw the trailer on the dvd and like others have already said this it promotes a horror movie that never came oh well poor marketing i guess br br if you see this at your movie rental store take a look because nothing is a great movie to watch if you have a big screen though you might want to wear shades
shlock merchant leo fulci takes a change of pace by making a trashy barely coherent sword and sorcery fantasy movie instead of his usual trashy barely coherent horror br br a wimpy orlando bloom type called ilias from some society vaguely resembling ancient greece travels across the ocean to caveman territory on some vaguely defined quest to battle evil where he joins up with a animal loving hunter to battle the wolf man and mutant minions of a vampiric topless evil sorceress wackiness ensues the sorceress is oppressing the local cavemen and wants the magic bow for herself she sends various minions each weirder than the last after our heroes who win through in the end striking a blow for oppressed cavemen everywhere this movie contains a steady stream of wtf elements and moments br br for some reason the entire movie is shot in soft focus and the picture is further blurred by the constant presence of mist on screen this may have been an attempt to create atmosphere or to hide how fake everything looks either way it failed there is no atmosphere unless it is one of scuzziness and mild bewilderment and there is no hiding how lame everything looks the wolf man minions look like a poor man's wookie for some reason the director fell in love with shots of them leaping through the air in slow motion six million dollar man style toward our heroes when they attack there are probably about a dozen of these shots throughout the movie and it gets goofier every time the other minions of the topless sorceress other than the generic leather clad humans are some lumpy white mutants who appear to be covered in cobwebs needless to say they are slow and unthreatening and when they speak sound like gay hispanic lisping daleks the fights are stilted and unconvincing and the special effects are woeful oh yeah the music is cheap synthesiser stuff that the makers of doctor who would have been embarrassed to have used br br ilias our nominal hero is bland and forgettable he also looks a complete wuss especially with his midriff revealing leather outfit and big hair and is clearly a moron sure he's a dynamite shot with his magical bow but he only takes about three or four arrows with him in his mission to battle this entire continent of evil needless to say he runs out of arrows within a few minutes and has to be saved by more traditional sword and sorcery hero mace when he meets ilias he establishes himself as the taciturn loner type claiming he has no friends but no sooner can you say latent homoerotic subtext they are bosom buddies traipsing the misty hills together mace promises to take ilias with him in return for bow related favours ilias asks where he is going wherever my legs take me is his reply good enough for ilias mace is also animal lover and outrageous hypocrite he proclaims his great love of and affinity toward animals citing the usual stuff about how he prefers them to humans because humans can be soooo mean he says he would never hunt and kill an animal to feed himself but he will steal meat off other people who have hunted down animals he is also not above randomly killing innocent passers by for no good reason not long after they meet he is testing out ilias' bow and the movie cuts to some random caveman minding his own business walking along and mace shoots him dead there is no indication this poor soul did anything to deserve this and even ilias who supposedly hails from a more moral and civilised society doesn't even raise an eyebrow br br the films villainess is quite unusual for the entire movie she is completely naked except from a g string and a golden mask that encompasses her entire head it's like fulci included her to make the movies obligatory t a quotient but decided she was bit too much of a butterface at the last minute she spends a lot of time seemingly being pleasured by her pet snakes and dreaming about being shot by a faceless bow wielding man who is dressed like ilias wow such symbolism later on in the movie she wimps out when she can't beat ilias and mace and promises to make herself the sex slave of some ancient warrior dude if he kills them for her hardly the world's most scary villain and not really a step forward for women's rights i think he sic's the cobweb creatures on our heroes and impersonates mace in a situation where there is no no one else around but mace to fool was he really worthy trading your self respect for ocron br br there are quite a few other wtf moments most of them come toward the end of the movie ilias wusses out i forget why possibly his permed hairdo got mussed but realizes the error of his ways and returns to aid mace in fighting the forces of evil all of a sudden for no reason his bow can suddenly fire out multiple target seeking bolts of energy the bolts can also shoot through solid rock when necessary needless to say his makes short work of the hordes of bad guys who have captured mace br br the climax is also rather nonsensical mace decimates ocron's remaining forces using the bows targeted laser attack capability he then is able to shoot ocron from a kilometre away using its shoot through rock capacity she starts dying her mask is ripped of revealing a hideous muppet head she staggers around screaming and turns into a dog and wanders off with another dog mace smiles roll credits br br strangely enough as far as these dodgy low budget sword and sorcery movies this one is reasonably lucid and focused any one who has seen wizards of the lost kingdom can tell you how nonsensical and meandering these movies can truly be
if you a purist don't waste your time otherwise hold onto your hat and enjoy the adventure i loved the stewart granger deborah kerr version i've seen it dozens of times but this film is every bit as good only different i won't detail the differences because it would spoil the film also it is a pleasure to see alison doody again i'm a huge indiana jones fan patrick swayze is good as quatermain and the supporting cast is superb i find the quality of the supporting cast one of the trademarks of a hallmark production and this film was no exception the cinematography is splendid and the score is perfect if you are looking for entertainment you won't be disappointed
homelessness or houselessness as george carlin stated has been an issue for years but never a plan to help those on the street that were once considered human who did everything from going to school work or vote for the matter most people think of the homeless as just a lost cause while worrying about things such as racism the war on iraq pressuring kids to succeed technology the elections inflation or worrying if they'll be next to end up on the streets br br but what if you were given a bet to live on the streets for a month without the luxuries you once had from a home the entertainment sets a bathroom pictures on the wall a computer and everything you once treasure to see what it's like to be homeless that is goddard bolt's lesson br br mel brooks who directs who stars as bolt plays a rich man who has everything in the world until deciding to make a bet with a sissy rival jeffery tambor to see if he can live in the streets for thirty days without the luxuries if bolt succeeds he can do what he wants with a future project of making more buildings the bet's on where bolt is thrown on the street with a bracelet on his leg to monitor his every move where he can't step off the sidewalk he's given the nickname pepto by a vagrant after it's written on his forehead where bolt meets other characters including a woman by the name of molly lesley ann warren an ex dancer who got divorce before losing her home and her pals sailor howard morris and fumes teddy wilson who are already used to the streets they're survivors bolt isn't he's not used to reaching mutual agreements like he once did when being rich where it's fight or flight kill or be killed br br while the love connection between molly and bolt wasn't necessary to plot i found life stinks to be one of mel brooks' observant films where prior to being a comedy it shows a tender side compared to his slapstick work such as blazing saddles young frankenstein or spaceballs for the matter to show what it's like having something valuable before losing it the next day or on the other hand making a stupid bet like all rich people do when they don't know what to do with their money maybe they should give it to the homeless instead of using it like monopoly money br br or maybe this film will inspire you to help others
words can hardly describe it so i'll be brief the thief of bagdad was my favorite movie as a child and it has never ceased to astound or enchant me i loved this film from the first moment i saw it when i was a boy of six who had started reading the arabian nights i remember walking into the tv room in the middle of sabu's battle with the giant spider and being instantly beguiled br br rarely has so much beauty magic and wonder been captured on film sabu and john justin are superb as the dashing heros conrad veidt is throughly delightful as the wicked villain jaffar and rex ingram is a joy to watch as the sardonic genie georges perinal's photography is some of the best use of technicolor one of the three credited directors is michael powell a filmmaker who has been rightfully heralded by the critics but is often overlooked by audiences for his remarkable films including a matter of life and death aka stairway to heaven and the red shoes he is one of the true masters of the camera right up there with david lean akira kurosawa and orson welles br br as with all great works of art the beauty of the thief of bagdad lies in the detail every frame has its own magical charm the story never lags and the characters and their actions are always involving here is a film that will never grow old
1 2 out of while i am not concerned with the fact that this is an english dubbed version as some reviewers have mentioned it should be noted as it seems to reside in many quebecois native hearts however this was a movie as a child that i was a fervent admirer of keeping in mind now that it was made for children i rate it on a relative basis the story is of children on winter break building an awesome snow fort and jostling back 'n forth for control with weapons such as snowballs and other concoctions as idle hands and free time equal winter break lessons if i had children this definitely is a film i would try and get them interested in as the snow fort wowed me when i was young and i think even children today would agree albeit with pixar and all the computer animation maybe i am out of date and just don't realize it in addition the movie's message is wonderfully allegorical and a positive one at that for children and adults alike
first of all i am a huge fan of madeleine l'engle and was so excited to see that a movie was made for one of my favorite books a wrinkle in time this movie however ruined that excitement for me i am sorry but meg was described in the book as having fizzy curls and glasses and as being considered very uncool in the movie she has straight hair and no glasses and is the sporty type with a deep voice this is not how madeleine l'engle pictured meg to be at all in fact meg was based on madeleine's character and depicted the way she felt when she was young this is just one major example how the book and movie are different so i would say if you want to watch it for entertainment purposes watch it but if you are a devoted fan of madeleine l'engle and her wrinkle in time series i would suggest skipping this movie
direction must be the problem here i recently heard john cleese speaking of working a skit for fawlty towers he was supposed to attack his car with a branch the first branch was too flimsy and not funny the second branch was too stiff to be funny the third was just flimsy enough to be funny this sort of attention to detail is missing from corky romano no matter how embarrassingly unfunny a comic bit was it wasn't fixed and wasn't left on the cutting room floor the one value i can find in this movie is as a study of a very flawed movie which somehow escaped into distribution without being repaired br br i've scanned dozens of other reviews here the number of reviews praising this absolute waste of time bolsters my suspicion that some people are getting paid to promote titles i can't fathom how anyone over the age of 9 could rate this title more than a 4 max i mean come on 5 is average i can't imagine anyone even those making money off of this rating it even as much as average br br this makes my list of the 10 worst movies of all time and hey i actually like the three stooges and can even tolerate ed wood
these writings write about the end of the plot so don't read it if you haven't seen this rubbish br br i found this rubbish film in the horror section which made me think it would be a horror if i owned a video store i'd put it in the boring section this film is so rubbish it will make you feel like you have lost your socks br br this film contains endless shots of people driving as if that was scary well i drive to work and back and sometimes to the store or to visit my cats almost every day and trust me it's not scary it even starts with 20 minutes of some people driving even the little kid does it too round and round he goes and he never stops what's so scary about watching a little kid riding a bicycle for an hour i think nothing and if you watch it you will not think so too br br the family in the car arrive at a big castle and they are given a tour just walking around endlessly looking at kitchens then the man walks around a for an hour and tries to kill his family for no reason that's all that happens and as you can see it's rubbish
i rate this 10 out of 10 why br br it offers insight into something i barely understand the surfers surf because it's all they want to do nothing else seems to matter as much to them as surfing nor is it a temporary thing it's a lifetime for these guys buried in the movie is a great history of surfing i have never surfed but i love surfing movies and have seen many none taught me what this movie did the movie was very well edited it flowed well the interviews were outstanding it's interesting from start to finish br br in summary it's about as good as a documentary as i have seen so i have to rate in terms of that so 10 10
with few exceptions most of george bernard shaw's plays have virtually disappeared from the theater these days too arch too talky appears to be the general verdict this bbc version of one of shaw's funniest plays doesn't refute that verdict it is certainly arch and talky but it is also wonderful and because of the quality of british theater it is perfectly cast with actors whom with the exception of helena bonham carter most of us have probably never heard of carter is splendid as the bulgarian girl who shelters the professional chocolate soldier pip torrens and later falls in love with him one might quarrel with the especially ridiculous interpretation of sergius patrick ryecart the bulgarian cavalry officer who led the charge into the enemy's lines and succeeded only because the enemy had the wrong ammunition for its machine guns however the role invites over acting and ryecart was obviously told to over act the other players are letter perfect carter as the self dramatizing bulgarian aristocrat and torrens as the swiss soldier of fortune are at the play's center of course and they are wonderful yes arms and the man comes across as a filmed play but you're unlikely ever to see a shaw film that doesn't betray its origin the plots are generally clever however shaw is all about the dialog the action is minimal even in st joan and the sets are immaterial enjoy this for what it is
wow what a whirlwind the 30's is a decade with plenty of movies of every type i can imagine especially during the early talkies phase there were movies which are painfully static and dull like dracula with bella lugosi and there were those that just don't give it a rest sometimes in a good way and other times not this is one of the films that don't stop for a minute and that is both a wonder and a pity lloyd bacon who also directed 42nd street must have been the king of the depression era musicals and he was probably excited with the possibilities sound brought to the world of cinema for he filled this picture with it there mustn't be a full minute or two without music or someone speaking it's completely crazy i was thinking the movie deserved a 5 or a 6 tops because the pacing was very poor since it was insanely fast and i sometimes didn't know what was happening and what to think the characters seemed to just running to and fro places talking about things which didn't interest me and probably no one else i thought i was just going to be rewarded with a small headache i noticed lloyd bacon also cast the female lead in 42nd street ruby keeler and 42nd street was a movie whose ending was the best part of it and you know what it happened the same thing with footlight parade the ending is absolutely incredible it has become hands down the most impressive musical i have ever seen the final part presents us some musical numbers and those are believe me something that make seeing the other rest of the movie worth the numbers are flawless there are three big bits and the most impressive is surely the second one suddenly the screen was filled with gorgeous and inventive camera work beautiful people and plain entertainment that made me forget my small headache
ghosts that still walk is one of those films that grabs you and doesn't let go until the end especially when you see it as a child seeing the film as an adult you have to admit it isn't really all that scary but the story is very fascinating and contains allot of great mysterious scenes especially the ones with the creepy mummy br br one of the best scenes in the movie is without a doubt the scene with grandpa and grandma in their new rv the scene with the rocks is very exciting and pretty scary also the scenes where the main character discovers his mother's secret is pretty frightening br br okay the acting in the film isn't all that great and the film sometimes seems to get a little bit boring but overall ghosts that still walk is fun too bad only a few people saw this film this film really deserves better i just wanna say mr flocker you've done a good job and for all you hollywood producers out there if you want to remake a movie remake this one
tom is listening to one of those old time radio broadcasts something kids from the 1950s to today would watch on tv however they didn't television when this cartoon was made so people got their entertainment from comedies to music to scary stories from the radio br br tom is literally shaking in his boots listening to some story about the phantom he's actually literally doing everything the narrator is saying such as hair standing on end icy chills race down her spine her heart beats in her throat etc jerry meanwhile is watching tom and laughing his butt off at his scaredy cat antics br br we then get a taste of what we will see for many years after this 194 cartoon in which jerry tortures tom for no reason other than sadistic pleasure if the cat asks for trouble that's one thing but when he's minding own business and jerry is physically and in this case mentally abusing him i have a hard time rooting for the little guy br br these early t m efforts also were a minute longer than all that followed sometimes that one minute makes a difference it did here as this actually dragged for awhile it could have been cut to five minutes without missing anything because the sketches went on too long that's usual for tom and jerry's usually they are much faster paced
as said before the visual effects are stunning they're breathtaking i personally use blender and graphics like that are not easy at all but that's all this movie is not only is the plot confusing but the overall conflict is not clear for example in the first scene proog and emo are trying to run away from who knows what the conflict seems to be between man and nature here later when they enter the room of the bottomless pit proog explains that one step out of place and you're dead here there's a more precise conflict between the careless man and nature as the movie progresses it's clear that a conflict exists between man and nature but suddenly a conflict exists between man and man when proog out of nowhere murders emo proog immediately changes from being a caring guardian looking after a lost child to being a sick man he betrays us not only is this depressing but we don't care because the conflict between the character's thoughts and actions is not developed it's not a story about someone through struggle emerging stronger it's depressing and has not point because there's no great truth about the human soul or about the world brought to light like a great drama does in my opinion the movie is severely underdeveloped in all aspects however the graphics are stunning but a movie is so much more than mere eye candy there's no truth no struggle and a bad surprise ending in conclusion an underdeveloped movie without a point but the graphics are good
a lot of people hated this movie but that i blame on two facts 1 they want it to be too much like the first couple of american pie movies and 2 they are trying to take it too seriously br br this one i found was the best one out of all six and i absolutely love dwight the plot is predictable i'll say that but then what teen comedy isn't road trip dirty deeds etc etc they are all incredibly predictable but still goddamn funny i say this is worth watching i love it i find it hilarious just don't watch it while comparing it to the first ones because it's nothing alike br br after watching naked mile and this one it became obvious that all the american pie movies were about and only about the stiflers which is fine by me br br watch enjoy love xd
i would not consider myself as one of leonard cohen's greatest fans he does however feature as an important poet musician in my literary musical heritage by far the most valuable element in this documentary is to hear leonard's reflections on his own life and career warming and humble br br unfortunately the most of the musicians featured in the concert didn't converse the nuances of leonard's musical literary manner nick cave jarvis cocker beth orton were the exceptions even though leonard highly values rufus wainrights interpretations of his songs br br what particularly failed in this documentary was the ability of the filmmaker to allow the viewer to see who leonard cohen is and how these musicians connect to him a lot is said in this respect but the viewer is not drawn into the person leonard cohen this failing is especially evident with the interviews with bono and the edge they view leonard as a special icon but can't translate their exact value of leonard cohen the collaboration with u2 is a farce the entire live registration looks like a rushed job and just as in the whole film only leonard cohen remains his part and can tell about his own part br br the entire montage and screenplay is much like a high school extramural project the use of effects such as echo slow motion or flashed images are ill placed some of the camera work is dismal part of the score hardly recalls any associations i may have expected at times it seemed the filmmaker was adding psychotic elements to the film perhaps a reference to his once use of lsd br br some unintentional humor at some point leonard tells how he influenced a musical genre initially he can't recall the genre's name until eventually he says it was punk the punksters really picked up on his music the next scene in the film is a live cover of 'i can't forget' br br and i can't forget i can't forget i can't forget but i don't remember who
if anyone is wondering why no one makes movies like they used to with conversation character and a simple theme of friendship struggling to evolve into something new better and different those folks need to take in this film and see top notch writing directing and acting that melds into a wonderful evening of observation on how things used to be in italy and england other days other times funneled into a terrific comedy of entertainment made in 1992 with alfred molina joan plowright polly walker josie lawrence jim broadbent miranda richardson and michael kitchens in the major roles under the brush stroke direction of mike newell these actors accomplish vividly memorable performances that are photographed with a sublimely subtle painter's eye reminiscent of the theatrical bedroom farce of the turn of the century this film might be called a friendship farce that becomes a worthwhile experience in the growth of the romantic nature within each character and the viewer too an artistic telegram on the importance of caring about those around us
br br a friend of mine enjoys watching the worst films he can possibly find and i have a good laugh watching them with him br br i have told him if he puts this one on again i will be forced to give him a good kicking br br he knows i am serious br br
i'm grateful for one thing and one thing only that this woman will now be thousands of miles away on an entirely different continent yay this programme summed up perfectly just how obsessed victoria beckham has become with whoring herself and her family out to the media in the name of self promotion and 'brand f cking beckham' br br a few years ago i used to really like 'posh and becks' i still very much admire david's talent but i have no respect for him anymore how can you respect someone who has his wife's hand shoved up his backside working him like a puppet br br it was clear the hand of victoria was all over beckham's premature departure from manchester united and now the same thing has happened at real madrid i hope beckham can live with the fact that although he may be earning squillions of pounds he's sold his soul for the american buck and will end his days playing for a team who would struggle to gain promotion from division one in england no offence america but at baseball and basketball you rule football you don't br br anyway i digress it's been years since i've seen such an over the top entirely false performance from 'posh' this being topped only during her cringe worthy red carpet performances following the rebecca loos 'debacle' when instead of throwing all the cr p at david he deserved she desperately clung onto his arm trying to save the million pound money spinner her marriage has become br br this whole pr stunt was pathetic why can't she just go over there quietly support her husband through the biggest mistake of his professional career and keep her head down when did she become so full of self importance that she feels the move to america should be shrouded by this huge fan fare br br incidentally i saw the david beckham documentary last night at least he has retained a sliver of grace and humility two things his wife could do with learning br br one more thing victoria you complain about constantly being hounded by the paps little hint stop tipping them off about your whereabouts you stupid woman br br good luck america
as other reviewers have noted this is an unjustly neglected depression era film directed by frank borzage two oscars and written by jo swerling leave her to heaven the westerner lifeboat etc it is a tough minded well structured and realized move about denizens of a new york city shantytown they're grifters beggars and women forced into prostitution but they're a community of people both good and bad with loyalties as complex as any group's br br perhaps primary among this movie's many admirable qualities is the contrast between spencer tracy's character bill and loretta young's trina he tough talking physically aggressive and evidently fearless but bill is not the character who gives this film its steely sense of survival while he blusters trina actually hangs tough if that term can be applied to a character so ladylike her devotion to him is obvious and complete when she becomes pregnant she says she will raise it herself if he wants to leave or i'll even give up the kid if you'll only be happy such is the dignity of loretta young's performance at age 20 as a quite simple character that she seems neither weak or dependent but rather a woman who recognizes happiness when she finds it and wants nothing more

this was one of the most boring horror movies that i have ever seen a college kid has an epidemic of nightmares involving roaming spirits at alcatraz trying to deliver a mix of nightmare on elm street and standard vampire fare in the form of a bad 80s music video this movie is jammed full of bad acting and an exhaustively slow moving story although being such a bad and often laughable movie dig those mullets and the terrible dialog it would be good material to spoof on for an episode of mystery science theater 3000 don't be fooled by the proud mention of the film being the 1987 winner of the silver scroll award by the academy of sicence fiction fanatasy and horror or that devo contributes to the soundtrack or that tony basil has a part in the film it is a giant disaster though one with a small cult following see the other imdb comments for this film
lost probably the best t v series ever made the storyline is clever and when all your questions are answered watching one episode 100 more are raised if lost can carry on it's magnificent ways and not get too carried away then it will be stapled the best show ever the survivors of a plane crash are forced to live with each other on a remote island a dangerous new world that poses unique threats of its own after reading this your thinking how on earth can that be interesting and heres your answer every season so far has always been full of surprises your always questioning your self why did that just happened and what's gonna happen next each time very unexpected thing's happen and the story goes on wonderfully so far the series just sucks you in it's chilling and very addictive everything from the wonderful creators and directing to the magnificent performances by the cast creates a very believable story lost is simply unbelievable amazing highly entertaining top notch t v at it's best how ever you want to put it br br lost beat's all other show's by a landslide and if your hating or criticising lost you don't know how to watch t v or watch drama lost simply doesn't disappoint you would think a series carrying on for so long can't keep getting better but it does it just keep's on flowing it's unlike anything you would ever think off every thing happens for a reason and that is truly shown in the series eventually you will reach a point were all the clues and everything that's happened or being done adds up you will feel and realise how the characters have changed and how and why everything is going on br br the 10 minutes of excitement you see something you didn't see coming something major has happened to character or on the island there's hope somewhere you see a major twist that can or will change everything you hear your thought's churn you wonder what's gonna happen next your heart beating the 30 minutes of brilliance you see a flawless scenes tension building you hear wonderful music by michael giacchino you see great flash backs impressive acting you see wittiness chilling atmosphere which then get's converted back into tension br br everyone has there show that they are addicted too that they can't get enough of that they admire every minute and can't wait for the next episode that they talk about 24 7 too me and many others it's this series lost once you start watching you won't get enough the creators did a flawless job lost is completely unique and original you won't see anything like it the clever idea of flashbacks and flashforwards and something major and different in every season sucks your thoughts would they ever make a series like lost something so interesting and something you will always remember it simply has stunned the world when it hit t v a new generation of dramatic sci fi a instant classic before it reached out to the viewers br br i'm sure you all heard of lost and it's 5 star reviews and your annoying friend that won't stop telling you about it so what's stopping you from watching br br every episode leads to something new and it just doesn't stop getting better and better you get more interested as it goes along you learn things that are on the island that you wouldn't even think off the characters start to become very likable and if your the critic type you would love to see lost in further detail things like how the relationship between characters develop and how they learn the ways to under look and take on challenges from the island all together it's a great drama and a flawless series i guess we just all hope that lost will not have a downfall in the episodes to come and go to far so if you don't watch lost read the comment from the top again and you should change your mind seeing is believing so until you start watching you will never know i strongly recommend this masterpiece of series lost start watching you have not seen nothing until you watch lost
well i watched this last night and the one thing that didn't make it completely terrible is that it was straight forward there was no beating around the bush that this kid was the anti christ however the movie was just poorly written for example they never explained how they made the dentist incident an accident or at the end how the cop just miraculously ended up at the house in time to save the kid without the police even being called yet the death scenes were just really bad and not entertaining at all the kid they chose to play the anti christ was boring and they really could've picked a better kid just don't waste your time watching this
this seemed an odd combination of withnail and i with a room with a view sometimes it worked other times it did not tragedy that they changed the name for the us release though keep the apidistra flying is much better than the nothing title a merry war acting was okay script was okay overall it was a mediocre film
this movie is without a doubt the worst horror movie i've ever seen and that's saying a lot considering i've seen such stinkers like demon of paradise lovers' lane and bloody murder which is a close second however i love bad horror movies and as you can tell from my username this one really sticks out at times there's nothing more entertaining than a poorly made slasher flick as for this film the opening scene in which a woman gets fried in a tanning booth appears to have no bearing on the film whatsoever especially since the movie fails to tell you that the event happened 2 years prior to the rest of the film the acting is nonexistent and most of the camera shot are of women's areas shrink wrapped in spandex the policeman was the most stone faced monotone actor i've ever seen the best worst part of this movie however has to be the murder weapon a giant safety pin what were they thinking who's the killer a disgruntled huggies employee i'd have to give this movie an overall zero but darned if i didn't have a blast watching it
i saw this movie the day it came out last year hilarious i thought well now it's on video and i saw it again i love this movie the things they do are sometimes dumb but that's what makes it my third favorite movie of all time the special effects are okay but the witty dialog will have you rolling i'm the kind of person that'll say i'm inspired by this movie so if you like dramas and other stuff avoid but for all others enjoy the acting is superb hank azaria is hands down the best he's neither a commie nor a fruit followed by ben stiller uh don't correct me it sickens me and then william h macy delivering his best performance outshining fargo everybody has praised everyone from macy to garafalo but i think kel mitchell was pretty good as invisible boy two problems the most boring part of the film is the subplot of the romance between stiller and claire forlani and the casanova parole hearing some scenes absolutely advance the story in no way but they're a blast kinka and especially the writers tend to drag on a scene untill all it's hilarity is gone but bam they switch and you're ready for more i swear after seeing this you will be tired from the explosive climax which i think was pretty cool the camera is pretty cool also moving at a furious pace with the actors also tom waits delivers an outstanding performance he has this kinda cool bad hero coolness to him and like someone else said the best parts are when the characters show some humanness to them captain amazing is pretty funny especially his speech to casanova about his perfect plan i was rolling and rush is pretty cool as casanova one beef the funniest comedian ever eddie izzard is almost wasted but his heart is in the right place so all in all a wonderful movie i give it twenty stars and hope that someday everyone will see the brilliance in the film's best parody the six million dollar man one laughing right now as i think about it 20 10
tess of the storm country is possibly the best movie of all of mary pickford's films at two hours it was quite long for a 1922 silent film yet continues to hold your interest some 80 years after it was filmed mary gives one of her finest performances at times the role seems like a greatest hits performance with bits of mary the innocent mary the little devil mary the little mother mary the spitfire mary the romantic heroine etc characteristics that often were used throughout a single film in the past the movie is surprisingly frank about one supporting character's illegitimate child for 1922 and at one point our little mary is thought the unwed mother in question if the academy awards had been around in 1922 no doubt the best actress oscar for the year would have been mary's
enjoyed catching this film on very late late late tv and it kept my interest through out the entire picture this wonderful creepy yet mysterious looking english home with evil looking decorations and weired furniture and rooms that make you wonder just why anyone would want to rent this home or even own it there are four 4 tales concerning this house and each resident of the home meets with all kinds of problems you will notice the beautiful lake and pond around the home and also the sweet singing of birds but don't let that fool you there is horror all over the place peter cushing black jack '80 gives a great performance as one of the person's living in the home and even christopher lee curse of the crimson altar 68 and his little daughter chloe franks jane reid make a wonderful exciting story together his daughter for some reason loves to read witchcraft books if you love creepy horrible and mysterious films with lots of surprises this is the film for you
zombie nation 2004 r br br hey i was bored i looked in my comcastic little box to find a movie to watch zombie nation hey i love zombie movies says the filmmaker has some sort of cult following in the description funny how it doesn't warn me not to watch this film i could've used that advice br br zombie nation is just like troll 2 in that it's completely misnamed it has little if anything depending on your point of view to do with zombies and takes place all within one city this film revolves around a crooked cop who acts as badly as possible he has to be trying to suck this much while he arrests women for trivial bullshit and then kills them yup he's a serial killer cop not only is this film flawed in thinking that it's a zombie flick it also gets its serial killer facts completely wrong serial killers enjoy killing they live for it and they get down and personal with it this guy knocks out the women and injects them with some poison he doesn't even have sex with the corpse or dismember it talk about boring eventually one of the whopping five women he kills has voodoo protection done to her and for no apparent reason all five come back to life and head off to kill this guy they were all buried or tossed into the ocean but you wouldn't know it buy the sharp clean clothes they're all wearing the women then act very poorly and take their revenge oh yay br br this film was crap in every category crap acting crap writing crappier sets and crappier make up effects the women don't look zombie like unless you count really dark make up around the eyes to be the de facto definition of what makes a zombie they can all talk behave think and act perfectly human the gore is weak compared to even many pg 13 films and the nudity is beyond brief you see glimpse of breasts in the opening sequence then the exact same breasts later go figure guess only one actress was willing to go topless for this trite the police station is so badly constructed that you can see where they stopped painting the walls of the warehouse they're obviously filming in you can see the pipes and the bad lighting and the overly sparse set up and even unless you are blind you can see the director failing steer clear it's a waste of time br br 1 10
just saw this at the 2003 vancouver international film festival and it was funny as hell and a bit surreal takes place in toronto where these two losers live in this run down house in the middle of a freeway system david hewlett pin cube cypher and andrew miller cube are just great as the two losers who wish the world would just go away the acting dialogue and writing are very good and the whole film looks great for such a low budget flick director writer vincenzo natali was in attendance at this screening and he seemed so intelligent and down to earth this guy is so inventive with these great stories that work so well within small budgets it puts big budget hollywood crap to shame
i have walked out of about 6 movies my entire life this was one of the worst movies i have ever seen i don't know how i sat through an hour of it i must have been in a coma that night i saw it in the theatre when it came out 8 years ago i couldn't even remember the name but i knew that penelope ann miller starred in it it must have really affected me to be wasting my time commenting on it today yech vomit barf
i laughed a lot while watching this it's an amusing short with a fun musical act and a lot of wackiness the characters are simple but their simplicity adds to the humor stylization the dialog is funny and often unexpected and from the first line to the last everything just seems to flow wonderfully there's max who has apparently led a horrible life and there's edward who isn't sure what life he wants to lead my favorite character was tom edward's insane boss tom has a short role but a memorable one highly recommended for anyone who likes silly humor and you can find it online now which is a bonus i am a fan of all of jason's cartoons and can't wait to see what he comes out with next
another vast conspiracy movie that tries to blame the us government and the armed forces especially the army for every disaster since the great flood anyone who has ever served time in the us military can see how bogus this film is uniforms equipment sets and mannerisms are all wrong and of course all senior officers are either corrupt criminals or total idiots blatant propaganda with no attempt at objectivity most of the theories presented have been disproven over the past few years uses every cliche' rumor and urban legend from the gulf all are presented as gospel the truth is no one knows for sure why some gw vets are sick and others are healthy as horses ps this is not new war is not fun and i know wwii korean and viet nam vets with some pretty serious ailments too and the government has the responsibility to take care of all of them sensationalistic movies like this will not solve the problem
we expected something great when we went to see this bomb it is basically a broadway play put on film the music is plain terrible there isn't one memorable song in the movie heard any hits from this movie you won't because there aren't any some of the musical numbers go on so long that i got up to go to the restroom and get some pop corn and it was still going when i got back if they were good songs well but they suck the pace is slow terrible character development the lead was praised for her singing but sounded like she screamed every song it was almost impossible to stand this movie has nothing to offer anyone but die hard broadway enthusiasts this is without a doubt the most over rated movie i've seen in my entire life a complete waist of time and money there is nothing memorable about this movie except danny glover who wasn't on screen enough and whose character wasn't developed enough rent the video and you'll agree this movie was an expensive over produced polished dog do
so american pie beta house is the 6th american pie movie in the series although it really has nothing to do with the original three american pie movies except some of the characters are supposed to be related to the characters in the original trilogy and eugene levy is in it can't that guy get better gigs br br there is very little to compliment this movie on there aren't any funny jokes the acting is painful to watch especially the girl with the southern accent which sounds more like a canadian's impersonation of a british woman pretending to be a hillbilly by using the word ya'll this movie makes me feel like such an idiot why didn't i apply to a college where nobody goes to class but everybody gets good grades girls consistently take their clothes off in public everybody has promiscuous unprotected sex without the burden of babies and stis and you can ejaculate all over a girl's family photos without her minding really this series has lowered itself to the standards of softcore porn maybe for the next one they'll finally break down and hire ron jeremy as the lead i'm sure they can just tie it in to the series by making his character stifler's 3rd uncle once removed or something like that
the worst movie i have seen since tera jadoo chal gaya there is no story no humor no nothing the action sequences seem more like a series of haphazard akshay kumar thumbs up advertisements stitched together heavily influenced from the matrix and kung fu hustle but very poorly executed br br i did not go a lot of expectations but watching this movie is an exasperating experience which makes you wonder what were these guys thinking br br the only thing you might remember after watching it is an anorexic kareena in a bikini br br the reason why i did not give a rating of '1' is that every time i think i have seen the worst bollywood proves me wrong
if i wanted to dribble i'd call a nurse br br haven't you had enough more than enough br br you got me a choo choo br br if i begin to die please remove the cowboy hat from my head that is not the way i wish to be remembered br br some of the wonderfully humorous and often insightful quotations from this charming and often insightful film dudley moore is charming lovable and rich sir john gielgud is aristocratic charming and loving and poor the two have a non father father and son relationship which defines the man whom arthur is to become will he follow his heart and soul or just his wealth over twenty five years i've returned to this movie with glee and amusement and joy it is a movie to return to time and time again and remember what is important in life as short as it is br br judge miller
from the very opening scene you will notice just how hard they tried to mimic the very smart and powerful 'cruel intentions' and how flat it landed you'll also notice what a terrible choice they made by casting robin dunne as valmont then in the second scene you meet the two best things in this movie amy adams and mimi rogers as kathryn and her mother that is if you can get past the fact that kathryn wasn't blonde in the first film then the movie goes on you see the cheap romantic story from miles ago and you notice sebastian has already met an anette in the past here called danielle and a cecile here called cherie how original is that for a prequel then it turns into a low budget 'wild things' type of film with lots and lots of oh my twists as i mentioned robin dunne was a very bad choice not that he is a bad actor he's good he just doesn't have the charisma ryan did amy adams who is in my opinion one of the most talented young actresses of our time once again delivers but with all the talent in the world there is no way one could save this trash as a whole this movie feels like a 'beverly hills 90210' episode the score has been stolen from 'cruel intentions' and 'jawbreaker' yes they used the score from jawbreaker couldn't they at least leave that one alone you'll want to pass this one if you want more cruel intentions watch stephen frears' dangerous liaisons
forest whitaker's performance is all the more impressive for making it almost worthwhile to sit through this dreck historical fiction does not justify changing history the absurdity begins from the ground up with the imaginary lead character played by james mcavoy to create a fictional observer for the purpose of giving the reader a point of connection in the book is regrettable regrettable that white people can't just read a book without a white protagonist to connect to but at least he was placed in a somewhat passive role making up a fake historical actor and crediting this fiction with exposing amin to the world is irresponsible lazy and stupid not making the actions of this creation believable or even sane is just criminal and has opened the door for movies like the one they're planning to make with leonardo dicaprio as a heroic enron whistleblower who never existed the logic of the world does not apply in this film where some scottish kid thinks its okay to sleep with the wife of a murderous dictator it doesn't apply where the wife of the dictator desires to sleep with some stupid scrawny irresponsible white boy for that matter everybody is lined up to sleep with this scrawny irresponsible arrogant white boy he even has gillian anderson licking her comely chops br br let me declare i do not like james mcavoy i'm not sure what it is about him but i thought his mr tumnus in narnia was creepy and pervy i think that kerry washington would never look twice at him so i can't believe that the wife of a powerful dangerous man like amin would risk and lose her life for him i don't believe him as a doctor and i just don't see the appeal his character seems to have far more arrogance than would make sense and trying to make him look like a badass in shooting the cow was just there's that word again absurd think about it you are watching all of these characters bend themselves into knots in order to accommodate this unbelievable main character and there never was such a guy br br gillian anderson looks incredible and sounds more british than most brits whitaker gives a great expansive magnetic performance and highlighted with his incomprehensible pre oscar speeches just how much he was acting it's a shame the film around him had no reason to exist
the first time i saw this i didn't laugh too much at the time i was only about fifteen years old and thought that maybe some of the deeper humor was too mature for me to understand at the time i had the same reaction when i viewed it a second time a few months ago and this time it was because felix's aborted suicide attempt at the beginning of the movie kind of darkened the movie a bit this scene made some of the things oscar said and did to felix later in the movie seem needlessly cruel and their personality clashes weren't as amusing as they could have been had i not already known the story i would have been worried that some of oscar's antics to felix might push him over the edge as it was it didn't make me laugh or smile like the television show with jack klugman and tony randall did still all in all a pretty good movie and it spawned one of the greatest sitcoms on television 7 out of 10
the beauty of this film is evidenced in the great portrayal of the power of a mother's love the exceptional performances the steady execution and the quite innovative script the film tells the story of an indian woman nandini who lives in canada with her husband shekhar and little kid raja all of a sudden her husband informs her that his family in india of whom she had not even known is in troubles and the couple rush to india when they get into the village nanadini is shocked and terrified to witness a very wild rural culture shekhar's family ruled by his cruel highly cynical and merciless father narasimha lives a poor and highly violent lifestyle which is full of murder and terror and where women are subservient and helpless nandini starts nagging shekhar to return home but he is soon killed by his father's enemies when she wants to leave narasimha refuses to let her take raja back to india here starts the intense struggle which can be called nandini vs narasimha br br india is not presented in a particularly positive light in this film but it only shows a very tiny minority of its rural areas so it may be even correct the portrayal is in my view fair and not one sided because the positive side is also presented to an extent such a horrifying sight could be shown in a film about any country in the world the locations are amazing the music is wonderful and krishna vamshi's direction is aided by very effective cinematography and good editing one thing that must be noted is the very ear pleasing background score by ismail darbar it is beautiful the characters are very well defined though we do get to see both their bright and dark sides in different portions of the film portrayed realistically throughout the film flows well and is an interesting and fairly entertaining watch its dialogues are superb and intelligently written and although the shocking proceedings can be very disturbing at some points a great deal of positive moments manage to relieve the tension br br the film's biggest strength is the performances karisma kapoor is breathtaking and very believable as nandini her ability to strike a balance between vulnerability and unrestrained emotion is simply incredible she displays so much intensity impulsiveness anguish and determination as the mother who wants to get her son back that this little kid seems to be her own son her outbreaks while facing off nana patekar which are like volcanic eruptions show us how the simplest of women can become a tigress when it comes to her child after fiza this is her most powerful performance one of the greatest actors indian cinema has seen nana patekar is indescribable as narasimha he manages to be hateful as narasimha yet admirable as the actor who plays him patekar displays cruelty wittiness and even humanity with total conviction he is outstanding another great performance comes unsurprisingly from india's most underrated actress deepti naval who sensitises her character to perfection sanjay kapoor is just adequate and shahrukh khan provides great comic relief anyway do watch shakti it could have been better but it is definitely a must watch
goebbels motivation in backing down was not explored in the aftermath of stalingrad the reich had decided to go for 'total war' this is referred to in the film part of this was to use women in the war effort which germany had not previously done to any great extent an ss massacre of women would have faced goebbels with a public relations disaster of massive proportion his preference was to make the problem go away as quietly as possible on the basis that the jewish men could always be rounded up later i understand the majority survived the war br br his other problem was that the 'red' berlin had never been very enthusiastically behind the nazi cause and had to be handled cautiously again a massacre of women could have cost the nazis what mediocre level of support they had in their capital city br br it was interesting that the majority of ss uniforms showed patches which indicated that the men wearing them were not of german nationality but were from german origins in other countries such as lithuania or latvia
john huston's wise blood was a more horrifying misrepresentation of flannery o'connor's book than i could have imagined from the utterly terrible acting performances and don't you oh that was done on purpose you just don't get it me to the musical score that was more suited to an episode of rockford files this film was revolting i viewed it with no ill will at the outset and in fact expected a pleasant experience but the misrepresentation of the southern characters from the ridiculously fraudulent southern drawl to the lilting comedic way their faith was portrayed was inexcusable right down to it's end which was completely devoid of any character sentiment it failed in every place that o'connor's book shined and resonated the actors portraying the southern policemen may as well have been eating smothered hot dogs from nyc street stands and quoting godfather the one redeeming acting performance was ned beatty's lively and dead on representation of hoover shoates a religious con artist who hears moates preaching the church of christ without christ and sees dollar signs and business opportunities o'connor's powerful book is most well known for it's creepy religious undercurrent that jibes the seemingly lifeless cadaver of faith mr huston's film is a shameful mockery of the author's intentions as they are understood by me and most of her fans if i may be so bold as to say so while i acknowledge that i can't know exactly what the author wished to convey i have enough affection for her and her works to desire to remain a fan if i viewed wise blood the way mr huston apparently did i would have thrown it in the trash for flannery's sake and mine i forgive you john huston the forgetting that will take some time
laughed a lot because it is so incredibly bad sorry folks but definitely one of the worst movies i have ever seen i know it is low budget but anyway the actors behave like playing in a soap the dialogues are absolutely crappy and the last time i have seen such odd pictures was at a trash nite at some youth video festival ten years ago i really appreciate that people gather together and shoot cheap movies but at least a certain amount of quality should be accomplished but at least one good thing the first three minutes of the movie were quiet interesting and looked okay and the score was really worth listening to the dvd cover promised a lot but that is by far the best this film has to offer
i missed the entire season of the show and started watching it on abc website during the summer of 2007 i am absolutely crazy about the show i think the entire cast is excellent it's one of my favorite show ever i just checked the abc program lineup for this fall and did not see it on the schedule that is really sad i hope they will bring it back maybe they are waiting until bridget moynahan has her baby or is it only my wishful thinking br br i read some of the comments posted about the show and see so many glowing remarks similar to mine i certainly hope that abc will reconsider its decision or hopefully another station will pick it up
this film is the worst film i have ever seen the story line is weak i couldn't even follow it the acting is high schoolish the sound track is irritating the attempts at humor are not the editing is horrible the credits are even slow i would be embarrassed to have my name associated with this waste of film don't waste your time even thinking about this attempt at acting
many critics have felt offended that r w fassbinder has portrayed both protagonist wilkie and the nazis in this movie in a human like manner connoisseurs of other fassbinder films however will realize that lili marleen 1981 belongs to fassbinder's women movies like the marriage of maria braun 1979 and lola 1981 fassbinder was convinced that stories can be told much better with women than with men because according to fassbinder while men usually fulfill their determined roles in society women are capable of thinking in a dialectic manner dialectics however means that there is not only a thesis and its antithesis like usually in our black and white world but a synthesis where the oppositions coincide moreover dialectic means that because of the third instance of synthesis the absolute opposition of the difference between thesis and antithesis is abolished concretely speaking starting from a dialect point of view and portraying the fascist state the underground fighters must necessarily use the basic means like the rulers do and between offenders and victims there is thus a chiastic relation so that every offender is also victim and every victim is also offender fassbinder has illustrated this abstract scheme that transcends classical logic in his play the city the garbage and the death 1975 which was filmed by daniel schmid under the title shadow of angels 1976 br br therefore approaching an a priori controversial topic like nazi germany in a dialectic manner the depiction of this time in the form of a movie gets even more controversial especially for people who cannot or do not want to see that our recognition of the world is by far not exhausted with a primitive light switch schema but needs the third instance of synthesis as controlling instance of its opposite members thesis and antithesis the mutual relationship between offenders and victims has to scrutinized since it is simply not true that the offenders are the bad ones and the victims the good ones in a synthetic viewpoint the bad ones participate on the goodness as the good ones participate on the badness they are mutually related in a world view based on classical logic a relation between good and bad cannot even been established and in an ethics based on this insufficient system of logic the bad conscience of the survivors of nazi germany feeling illogically enough responsible for the deeds of their ancestors exclude the possibility of a relationship between the two extremes and thus a synthesis in the form a new evaluation based on this relationship as well from fassbinder's dialectic viewpoint it follows that neither lili marleen nor lola nor maria braun can be condemned for their misuse of the ruling system for their private purposes because they don't misuse them they just use them in the opposite since victims must repeat the actions of the offenders as the offenders must repeat the actions of the victims because good and bad are no longer simple mirror images of one another like in two valued logic their strategies are legitimated by the chiastic structure of a logic that describes our world that is not black and white at all much better than a black and white logic
i gave this 4 stars because it has a lot of interesting themes many here have already mentioned from the domestic violence to sexuality and many of the taboos therein outside of the gore i really would not call this horror so much as i would science fiction br br it's bleak depressing and hopeless while i don't mind a less than cheery ending i'm really very tired of the humans suck cliché that's central to every movie i know you can't get a liberal arts degree today without bowing to the alter of self hatred as a member of the human race but how's 'bout as a writer director we pretend we are different than everyone else in the pack and notice that the aliens killing the human race are evil right now if you are reading this and believe that humanity deserves to die just go out find a lake and swim 'til your arms are tired this way you won't be around to direct the next film or write the next book telling me i deserve to die for being alive it's silly not thoughtful and boring
ok so chuck norris somehow found a way to get this sequel produced i have one question why who read this script and said sound's great original this movie is regurgitated crap that i wouldn't tarnish my toilet bowel with of course it is another story following in the tradition of mia invasion usa walker texas ranger delta force and so on in which chuck norris of course is the one man who can same america from some bad guys he doesn't even need a gun most times it's stupid patriotic jargon that stales the mind big surprise that the only one who will direct these norris film's is chuck's son eric eric norris has primarily worked on all his father's films and tv shows doesn't this strike anyone as a sign that he has no directing talent afterall he's directing the same people as before in the same stories as before only difference is the characters' names if this is supposed to make me patriotic and cheer for the usa than our country is in much worse shape than i ever imagined hopefully this will be the nail in chuck norris's acting coffin
to sat how awful the shield is you'd have to write pages and pages so suffice it to say that it is a monument to bad directing br br when directors go awry should have been the title of this production indeed directors are supposed to infuse their work with a sense of visual style and story telling that propels the story forward br br how is constantly shaking the camera and playing with the zoom lens a style how is it propelling the story forward of course there's also the editing by random numbers nonsense apparently it's become hip to just cut randomly br br i guess it's too much work to do good editing br br well that made it too much work for most people to watch the shield which languished as one of the most over hyped and unwatched shows of all time
white chicks hold on why couldn't they have dressed as black chicks oh yeah they wouldn't look different at all can anyone give me one wayans movie where they haven't dressed up as ladies don't be a menace doesn't count jack white and michael costanza ghost wrote that the other norton trio members acted as directors br br in white chicks there's never really any jokes it's just the wayans acting like girls for 2 hours there's no setups no punchlines and no laughs there is a lot of i think i'm gonna play some time crisis 3 at least for me there was 5 times to be exact br br somebody has to tell kenan ivory damon marlon shawn damien the only talented one kim rakeesha george w and osama bin wayans to stop making movies its only hurting the o zone layer br br verdict 1 2 out of
this film might have weak production values but that is also what makes it so good the special effects are gross out and well done my favorite part of the movie had to be chrissy played by janelle brady she is super hot and also has a good nude scene robert prichard as the leader of the gang is hilarious as are the other members this film is actually trying to make a point by saying that nuclear waste plants are bad 4 10 fair comedy gross out film
if you've ever seen this movie you'd know that it if you haven't and want to see a classic bad movie i suggest you see this movie because it ranks right down with the worst so if you're really bored go rent it if you want to know what it's like here's my little summary adam sandler is hired to work on a giant cruise ship with some ms universe models and five other people adam doesn't like how one passenger is getting all the babes and he tries to take over with the cheezy jokes but wait it only gets worse you'll have to rent the movie yourself to see how bad it truly is
just don't bother i thought i would see a movie with great supspense and action br br but it grows boring and terribly predictable after the interesting start in the middle of the film you have a little social drama and all tension is lost because it slows down the speed towards the end the it gets better but not really great i think the director took this movie just too serious in such a kind of a movie even if u don't care about the plot at least you want some nice action i nearly dozed off in the middle main part of it rating 3 10 br br derboiler
it might not be the best movie of 2006 but it was a just a movie to excite and to think about the sentinel is a good political thriller movie which seems similar to or even borrows some elements from other political thriller movies such as in the line of fire and the manchurian candidate the basic plot of this movie is similar to other movies like this a plot to kill the president of the united states michael douglas stars as secret service agent pete garrison who spearheads the operation only to find out later that he has been framed kiefer sutherland co stars as a sort of rival by the name of david breckinridge and eva longoria as jill marin who is a rookie agent going under the guidance of agent breckinridge and academy award winner kim basinger as first lady sarah ballentine one improvement for this movie could have been more action as it is by some sources considered just as much an action film as is a thriller film but a good thing about this movie is instead of just an assassination plot to kill the us president it also concerns a mole traitor in the secret service who is leading the president in the wrong direction
i have no idea what the producers of the shield were trying to do but the result speaks for itself the shield is practically unwatchable br br supposedly the performances on the shield are great br br in reality the show is so badly put together that you can't even really see the performances for instance the editing cuts away from reaction shots before they've had their full impact br br i don't know what intellectual rationale there is for that but it robs the show of all emotional impact br br i'll give the shield one point for ambition in its subject matter but that's pretty much all i can give it br br it's a shame to see a number of talented performer waste their gift on something so strangely badly filmed
don't understand how these animated movies keep coming out and no matter how good or bad it is people love it br br i saw this movie with my two kids 5 7 they like pretty much anything animated like most people who rated this film the theater was almost full and i looked forward to seeing the movie with its superb cast to tell the truth i was bored silly it was unbelievably predictable and just plain unfunny there were a couple chuckles throughout the film and that was it of course they tried time and time again to get the cheap laugh but just didn't work my son almost always says to me that he wants the dvd after we see an animated movie but not on this one my daughter fell asleep half way through also the kids thought the character animation looked weird i haven't heard that from them since seeing the polar express which gave my daughter nightmares br br trust me i'm not the type who looks for the negative in everything but quality is quality and like so many animated movies they throw out there it has very little
this anime is a must see for fans of evangelion it's an earlier work of anno hideaki but his unrestrained dramatic style is quite in place also those who didn't like evangelion might find this release to bit slightly more palatable gunbuster is rather unique to sci fi anime in that it's actually based on real science in fact the show has several little science lesson interludes explaining the physics behind some of the events in the movie one of the big dramatic points in the film is the relative passage of time at speeds near that of light the series does a wonderful job of dealing with the imaginably traumatic experience of leaving earth on a six month mission traveling near the speed of light and returning to an earth where ten years have passed the main character remains age 17 or 18 throughout the entire series while almost all of the other characters age considerably be warned this show is heavy on the sap at times it also has a couple of the most wholly unmerited breast shots that i have ever seen i found it fairly easy to ignore the skimpy uniforms and boo hoo scenes because the series is otherwise very good but viewers with a low sap tolerance might want to stay away from this one on an interesting note gainax as always managed to run out of money in the last couple of episodes however they managed to use black and white film and still action sketches to produce a good resolution anyway the ending is a bit silly but it left me with such a good feeling in my gut i couldn't help but love it gunbuster is in my opinion one of the finest pieces of anime around
to die for 1989 was just another d t v feature that made an appearance on cable ad nasuem during the early nineties the only thing notable about this feature was the last movie duane jones appeared in other than that there's no reason to watch this vampire flick unless you like pseudo chick flicks masquerading as a horror film a tired vampire longs for love and searches the back streets of l a looking for it will he succeed or will vlad just strike out again like he has for the last century br br this movie must have been big because a couple of sequels soon followed they're so bad they make this one look like a classic i know this is a movie about vampires but the film makers could have used to lighting br br not recommended by me because i didn't like it br br 'nuff said
this is probably one of the worst movies ever made bad acting bad special effects bad plot bad everything in the last 15 minutes a cat suited cyborg is introduced which muddles everything malcom macdowell must have needed to make a house payment because otherwise he would have had to sell himself on hollywood blvd to pay the bill i just don t know how you can go from clockwork orange to this crap and be able to look yourself in the mirror each morning i could have done better special effects in my bathtub there's no continuity the editor must have been asleep or on drugs its so bad acting do they have to smoke to be bad the gun either shoots blue flames or bullets make up your mind the bad girl and the other girl in the movie look so much alike that it is confusing whay is it called 2013 seadly wake it has nothing to do with the movie
it was the night he came home warned the posters for john carpenter's career making horror classic set in a small american town halloween centerers around serial killer michael myers' attempts to track down his sister laurie strode and in the process eliminates all her friends in rather brutal ways leaving poor laurie to fight against the seemingly indestructible michael this plot out line inspired countless horror knock offs throughout the 80s 90s and continues to do so today as well as a poorly received 2007 remake the difference between them and this is quite simply that halloween is the best br br made on a very modest tight budget halloween changed the face of horror in 1978 and spawned the sub genre of sexually promiscuous teens getting stalked by a knife axe chainsaw wielding psycho
hello everyone this is my first time posting and i just love the movie no child of mine and i could watch it over and over well i taped it a long time ago like a few years ago and i dropped it and broke it and i haven't seen it in a few years could any one please tell me when it will come on again i would really appreciate it alot you can email me if you want to cause that is my favorite movie of all including empty cradle to and if anyone knows when that comes on to please let me know i would really appreciate it alot br br
tillman jr 's drama about the first african american navy master diver gooding jr who defies all odds and achieves his goals despite a strict embittered trainer the screenplay is not bad a bit extreme at times but the direction and acting is first rate and this film is inspiring and achieves what its supposed to do i liked deniro in the lead although its not on par with his masterful works taxi driver godfather and all the others it is as good as his other good performances such as in king of comedy or angel heart deniro is always convincing and believable here very good performance gooding jr is not bad definitely one of his better performances imdb rating 6 6 my rating 9 10
i like a movie that has at least a vestige of a story this doesn't occur in this movie it's a series of vignettes with no cohesion br br there are scenes of a person collecting pineapple cans a woman with a blond wig never removes her sun glasses this woman shoots at other people at the beginning of the movie and we never find out why she disappears completely after about 30 minutes there is another coquettish woman who endlessly cleans a man's apartment there are endless scenes at a fast food joint where the mamas papas 'california dreaming' is vastly overplayed i used to like the song the dialogue is mostly concerned with food pineapples chef's salad and ordering drinks i assume most of the actors gained weight during this movie because a lot of fast food was consumed br br there is no passion in this movie because there is no story this is purportedly a romance it is no such thing i just wonder why i didn't hit the fast forward i kept waiting for something significant to happen  it doesn't maybe that's the only consolation to this movie scenes shifted so rapidly that it tricked you into assuming that there was going to be a revelation to all the nonsense
dr hackenstein begins at the turn of last century '1909 the dawn of modern medical science' to be exact dr eliot hackenstein david muir is in the early stages of his rejuvenation of living tissue experiments dr hackenstein manages to bring a skinned rat back to life which confirms he has succeeded in bringing the dead back to life it's now 'three years later' dean slesinger micheal ensign is round the doc's house for dinner as dean slesinger dr hackenstein eat they talk about hackenstien's experiments which dean slesinger has always been opposed to dr hackenstein shows dean slesinger his laboratory in his attic where he keeps the severed head of his wife sheila sylvia lee baker who died in an unfortunate 'accident' can telepathically talk to him christy botkin provides sheila's voice apparently dr hackenstein also show's dean slesinger a skinned chicken running around in a cage explains that with the process he has developed he will bring sheila back to life the dean has some sort of seizure apparently dies meanwhile sisters wendy bambi darro as dyanne dirossario leslie trilling catherine davis cox plus their brother alex john alexis their cousin melanie victor stacey travis are driving along near hackenstein's house when they crash they seek shelter assistance arrive upon hackenstein's doorstep dr hackenstein invites the four stranded travellers to stay for the night later on dr hackenstein is visited by two grave robbers xavier logan ramsey ruby rhodes ann ramsey who deliver a male body when hackenstein actually needs female parts for sheila dr hackenstein being the genius that he is decides not to waste the opportunity of having three young beautiful specimens available starts to 'borrow' the bits 'n' pieces he needs to complete sheila br br written directed by richard clark i was pleasantly surprised by dr hackenstein i'll state right now that it ain't brilliant by any stretch of the imagination but for what it was i actually quite liked it it moves at a reasonable pace even if it does tend to drag a little bit during it's middle as things settle down the script tries to mix slapstick humour like a scene when dr hackenstein is trying to restrain melanie she tries to gain the attention of his deaf housekeeper yolanda simpson catherine cahn by kicking out hackenstein keeping melanie behind yolanda's back who is seemingly oblivious to what's happening with a touch of gore but i'd say dr hackenstein is more of a comedy than horror in conception feel throughout there are some tacky puns sexual innuendo as well which are always good for a laugh dr hackenstein to wendy would you like to see my instruments as an example i also thought the scene when mrs trilling phyllis diller reports her missing daughter's to the bemused detective olin william schreiner was a pretty amusing sequence going round in circle's talking about why he isn't looking for them even though he has only just been told why the cell doesn't have a prisoner in it that if he didn't find the cousin not to worry about it none of it's flat laugh out loud but i must admit i found myself smiling on occasion found the film as whole to be quietly amusing there isn't a lot of on screen gore a few severed limbs sheila's decapitated head some medical stitching those skinned animals which are definitely fake by the way i liked the characters in dr hackenstein too which was surprise in itself the acting isn't brilliant but to give everyone credit they put some effort into it lots of exaggerated facial movements some serious overacting means it's never dull oh the three birds in dr hackenstein are fit if you know what i mean technically the film is ok as well once again it ain't going to win any oscars but i have to give the filmmakers at least some credit for trying to pull off a turn of the century period setting it doesn't always work the clothes are at odds with each other at times the girls look like their from victorian england while the guys look like their from a western the house looks as if all the filmmakers did was remove any modern object from the room stick a few candles in there it comes across as a little bit on the cheap side but it really isn't a bad looking film at all considering could have done without the comedy music though overall i ended up enjoying dr hackenstein much more than i thought i would although that in itself isn't a recommendation it's certainly is not the best comedy horror film ever made it certainly is not the worst either a watchable enough piece of harmless fun
i wish i'd known more about this movie when i rented it i'd put it in my queue on the basis of heather graham and her strong cred as an actress imho while parts of the movie were charming much of the movie felt contrived undeveloped or otherwise just boring or predictable not to mention the ick factor of so many people thinking the sibs were a couple i don't care how big a part of the story line that is it still felt a bit um gross and charlie for a zoologist she certainly doesn't seem to be very attuned to signals from other homo sapiens what was it about her besides her hotness and some common interests that made gray fall for her the story could have been so much more interesting with a little more depth high points molly shannon although i do agree with the reviewer who found her annoying on occasion the cabbie in drag and the dance sequences if sam gray were such great dancers i wish we'd seen more of that as the bits we were shown were indeed better than most of the rest of the movie could have been better
when i was a little girl and my dad owned a video store this was among my favorite movies i hadn't heard much about it since then nor did i really remember anything about it it having been forgotten in the wake of don bluth's other probably better films i managed to track it down a few weeks ago however and was pleasantly surprised again set in new orleans in the 1930s the animation is delightful and the songs are memorable there are a few goofs in continuity if you look hard enough but they generally don't detract from the storyline which leaves you smiling and maybe even a little misty eyed if you are a lover of animals the characters are believable maybe even a little too grown up for younger watchers as well two paws up and for those of you who haven't seen it in a while definitely worth a re watch
having never heard of this film until i saw the rental dvd i as a bit sceptical there have been many films in the past with good ensemble casts that can't do anything film a bad script and in some cases don't seem to care br br well having just watched it there was no reason not to give this movie a theatrical release it is good the story like most in this genre can seem a little forced at times but there does appear to be a good amount of realism here too that allows the momentum to carry i was pleasantly surprised at how good a job justin timberlake does here too with such a major role ok he's not oscar material yet but he'll learn with each role and he shows a lot of promise for the future here dylan mcdermott too was amazingly good in his unexpectedly nasty role and is definitely the cream of the crop in this movie br br ultimately just give it a go you won't be disappointed you won't be bored in fact i think you'll be more than happy with the end result
bette midler is again divine raunchily humorous in love with burlesque capable of bringing you down to tears either with old jokes with new dresses or merely with old songs with more power punch than ever all in all singing new ballads power singing the good old perennial ones such as the rose stay with me and yes even wind beneath my wings the best way to appreciate the divine miss m has always been libe since this is the next best thing to it i strongly recommended to all with a mixture of adult wide eyed enchantment and appreciation and a child's mischievous wish for pushing all boundaries
i downloaded this movie yesterday through an internet site the quality was kinda good i was watching the movie with high expectations though i knew it was a flop especially as the film has superstar amitabh bachchan playing the role of a villain i though at least actors like him would have done some worth to their roles but unfortunately mr bachchan failed to impress as villain this proved that nobody can compete amjad khan's magic rgv's trial to re kindle the past backfired royally sholay the old one is a milestone in indian cinema with an all star cast cult dialogue stylish cinematography and a brilliant soundtrack which is still a hit with present generations too a good actor like ajay devgan's talents are wasted and his performance was average prashant raj a newcomer doesn't know what acting is nisha kothari proved she is one of the worst actresses we have i don't know how she is still in rgv's crew urmila abhishek seen in a song with no excitement and passion mohanlal tried his best and susmitha sen's work was good i somehow liked her work in this movie it was a total carnage of the original sholay
the dancing was probably the only watchable thing about this film and even that was disappointing compared to some other films my gawd br br to me this is the worst kind of film one that assumes it's a work of art because it has all the trappings of film as art yes it's beautifully photographed but ultimately lacks the depth and tension of the dance around which the film supposedly surrounds itself tango is a tease it's hot it has drama it's audacious precisely what this film is not
soldier is not as bad as many have made it out to be i found the film to have some of the sacarstic cynical humour like that in paul verhoven's starship troopers the lack of dialogue and over the top action is deliberate and adds to the comic book atmosphere br br one particular trivia bit stands out for me todd has the names of several space war campaigns tattoo'd onto his chest and one of these battles is tannhauser gate for the oblivious ones out there tannhauser gate is mentioned in roy batty's elegiac last lines in blade runner to imagine that todd could have fought alongside android troops like roy is mind boggling to say the least maybe script writer david peoples was nostalgic br br i'll give this one 3 out of 5
pretty good film from preminger labyrinthine at times as it explores sets and locales from various angles and perspectives as if it were a nature film on the denizens of the modern city and how they live in this sense it is visually and spatially satisfying as its hero a good cop with a bad temper gets into very hot water when he accidentally kills a guy with a plate in his head br br dana andrews plays the lead as if it were hamlet and has never been better the story may be pure melodrama but andrews gives it weight and almost raises it to the level of tragedy as his girl gene tierney is attractive but unremarkable gary merrill makes for a very interesting villain with his natural warmth providing a nice contrast to andrews' coolness his smiling amiable seeming bad guy seems to be continually challenging his nemesis by the mere fact of his being emotionally open as opposed to the tightly wound and moralistic cop who is pursuing him br br there are no major surprises in this film which seems transitional for all concerned for director preminger it is a reunion of sorts with his laura stars andrews and tierney who were passing their career peaks at around the time the movie was made the supporting cast merrill karl malden neville brand are understandably more optimistic as they were all on their way up preminger as serene an observer as ever lets the events unfold without expressing a strong point of view as the morally ambiguous ending is somewhat disappointing for the cat and mouse game between the two antagonists seems larger and more archetypal than any mere movie could contain much less resolve br br
fans of creature feature films have to endure a lot of awful movies lately blood surf shamelessly joins the list of stupid redundant pulp horror titles about ridiculously big animals that want to turn the food chain upside down crocodiles are particularly successful as we already had to struggle our way through the abysmal 'crocodile' directed by a disappointing tobe hooper and 'lake placid' blood surf is every bit as bad as these other films and  on top of that  it likes to exaggerate tremendously the saltwater crocodile supposedly is 90 years old over 30 ft long and it kills for fun during the film he amuses himself by devouring a bunch of utterly stupid surfer dudes dudettes who came to seek new thrills by surfing in a shark congested area the only beautiful aspect about this film is the tropical location even though it's a completely inappropriate setting for a film like this the lagoons and nature looks marvelous every other aspect is simply disastrous there's a quite a bit of gore but it all looks fake and laughable the dialogues are downright painful to listen to you won't believe some of the lines these actors have to say i know surfers are supposed to be a mentally underdeveloped group but i hope for their own sake they're not that stupid early in the film one of the characters refers to jaws as being a 'mechanical toy' but the croc here looks at least 10 times less real than spielberg's great white shark the visual effects in 'blood surf' are amateurish and the massacres fail to impress i won't say too much about the acting since it's secondary in flicks like this the girls look sexy in wet shirts and their boobs joyfully bounce while running away from the beast you guessed right blood surf is a very bad film so bad it becomes fun again but 'funny' for a whole other reason than james hickox intended
several young iranian women dress as boys and try to get into a world cup qualifying match between iran and bahrain when they're caught they're penned in an area where the match remains within earshot but out of sight the prisoners plead to be let go but rules are rules br br given the pedigree of its director jafar panahi it was disarming to discover that offside is a comedy and a frequently hilarious one in 1997's the mirror panahi presents two versions of iranian girlhood and leaves the audience to wonder which one is real in 2000's the circle several iranian women step outside the system their transgressions are different but they all end up in the same tragic place br br however thinking now about offside it's hard to imagine it as anything other than a comedy because the situation it presents is so obviously ridiculous as the women demand to know why they can't watch the soccer match and their captors struggle to answer the only possible outcome is comedy br br what makes offside most affecting is that the young women are not portrayed as activists attacking the system they are simply soccer fans and patriots and despite the fact that they are clearly being treated unfairly they never lose their focus on the match and the historic victory that is within their nation's grasp
elia kazan one of the best theater directors this country ever had showed he was equally at home with movies with panic in the streets mr kazan gives us an early version of what would come later with perhaps his master piece on the waterfront although both movies share only the water setting for they are different visions about different subjects br br mr kazan shot on location in new orleans the adaptation by daniel fuchs of the edna and edward anhalt stories that are the basis of the film is remarkable in that it takes us to places that no tourist dared to see when visiting the big easy one of the big assets of this film is the magnificent black and white cinematography by joseph macdonald that shows new orleans at its best also the music by alfred newman and the song by billie holiday gives the proceedings a nice touch br br this film could have been shot in new york or another northern big city because it presents us with characters that speak more like broklynese than maybe a southern accent one might hear in that part of the country br br one thing comes clear in the movie jack palance making his screen debut smolders the screen every time one sees him he was so intense at the same time this tough guy shows a tender side of him when he goes to see his sick partner who unknown to him is stricken with a fatal disease blackie comforts this man caressing his sweaty face and running his hands through the dying man's greasy hair with abandon notable also was the fact that mr palance and mr mostel appear to have been doing their own stunts something so refreshing because both actors make it seem real br br the film also presents a normal side with the introduction of the reed family at the beginning of the film we see a family man painting furniture with his young son later he and the wife discuss how it appears they can't make ends meet with his salary something that many families have to deal with on a daily basis richard widmark playing a normal person is not as effective as when this actor plays more cunning and intense people barbara bel geddes as the wife sounds as though she's a suburban woman from connecticut br br the film is enjoyable thanks to mr kazan's direction and the excellent cast working in the movie
the story of a drifter his sheep ranch boss and the boss's daughter is not for all tastes but it's still very intriguing it takes place in the beautiful country of new zealand amongst the scenery we've come to know so well through other films from this region br br this movie was the first time i had ever seen the excellent mary regan and i've been a fan of hers ever since the cast also contains bruno lawrence who is probably best remembered by american audiences from the film smash palace terence cooper takes a turn as the ranch owner who pays a little too much of the wrong sort of attention to his daughter regan br br sharply acted with unforgettably shattering performances from all of its leads i first saw this movie in extremely edited form on late night television here in america but believe you me the unexpurgated version is not to be missed
i loved the idea of this film from the moment i first saw a trailer for it einstein has always been one of my heroes and the image of him as the kindly playful slightly mad genius was enough to get me to see the film the added spice of matthau as einstein made it even better br br the story is pure fantasy but a delightful one an auto mechanic falls in love with a beautiful woman who happens to be einstein's niece with the help of four fairy godfathers of physics ed embarks on a quest to win catherine's heart throw a jealous fiancé who exemplifies the worst of experimental psychology and eisenhower into the mix and you have pure fun br br the film is filled with great character actors and delightfully sweet and daffy performances walter matthau play einstein as a mischievous imp cupid with a slide rule tim robbins is wonderfully endearing as ed and meg ryan plays a step above her normal rom com level stephen fry is a joy as the rrratman and ryan's fiancé who lacks a single romantic bone in his body br br the film fell below most radars but is a delightful treasure that does not grow stale with repeated viewings it features first rate writing and performances and is a gentle treat in a less than gentle world
this film is really vile it plays on the urban paranoia of the 70s 80s and puts it into a school context i'm not saying that urban crime wasn't a problem for a lot of people or that schools weren't aren't problem areas but this vile piece of exploitation takes the biscuit violence is beyond anything realistically imaginable but in this case it's not a case of social issues but a white upper middle class student uses it to turn himself into the crime kingpin of his local high schoiol and of course he knows how to play the system does that sound familiar yes this turd is pure violent exploitation a really nasty piece of work it's disturbing brutality dressed up as a social comment this belongs in the same category as trash like exterminator death wish 2 5 and so on and so on the only remarkable thing is that michael fox was so broke at the time that he had to do stuff like this
rob schneider is a famous comedian cause of his movements facials and performances of not humans this time he is the animal marvin is a loser who is trying to be a hero and one day nobody takes a call from a man that gets attacked so marvin has to take this case and save the attacked man but on his way to the crime scene he crashes with his car and gets really damaged he doesn't remember what happens and at the next ordinary day his life is not same when he finds out that he has animal instincts of course we got our female that our main character is trying to reach but his tryings are useless she is played by collen haskell there are no negative characters the negative character is destiny if i could use this metaphor marvin should find out how to become a normal human being again by the way his animal instincts helps him in some situations schneider's performance is a so so the movie is so unreal that gets stupid at some moments but it is one of those movies called mindless fun as i have written above so watch it for the monkey style rob schneider but it is definitely not one of the best comedies ever or one of the best movies that schneider appears in he is a great comedian but this is not his best movie
i didn't feel that this film was quite as clever as it seemed to think it was but enjoyed it nevertheless br br it is original although reminded me a little of two other french films vidocq and city of lost children mostly for the colouring but also for the edgy quality of the close ups of the characters br br set in a prison cell but do not let this put you off this film seemingly goes further than many a multi locationed blockbuster br br always interesting with the perennial 'black arts' well to the fore and very good characterisation making some only too believable br br scary with some gore this is well worth a viewing
the majority of stephen king's short stories are little gems with original ideas that don't take a long time to develop basically lean and mean he sets them up quickly in a scarce number of pages you read 'em and you're finished before you know you've begun they're like the equivalent of a carton of mcdonald's fries they taste really good and you know there's not much nutritional value in them re from a literary standpoint they don't say much about the universal human condition but you're still gonna scarf 'em down just don't be a pig and go for the extra super sized portion and fill up on too much grease too much grease is a metaphor for the prose in king's novels when find yourself reading one of them and saying come on enough with the pop cultural observations or clever yankee asides get on with the story already he has compiled four books of short story collections i've read them all from nightshift to the latest everything's eventual and they all display an efficiency of getting to the point which is sometimes sorely lacking in his tome sized novels br br but his short stories never overstay their welcome which brings us to the tv adaptations of nightmares and dreamscapes br br how in the hell did they the series' producers get a green light to turn stories that usually averaged 15 pages into 50 minute episodes i'll tell you how two words stephen king stories with his name on them probably didn't come cheap and one hour shows enable more advertising than half hour ones so what should have been an anthology of mostly 23 or 24 minute episodes is turned into double that length and double the commercial time ka ching br br i'm not going to waste time synopsizing the plots of these stories this review supposes you have already read the stories and or seen the show what follows is merely my gut reactions to what tnt presented of the four installments so far here's my ten cent assessment from first to worst br br battleground not a classic by any means but hey how could anyone argue with keeping william hurt from opening his trap by filming this episode without a single line of dialog and the tongue in cheek reference and destruction of the killer zuni doll from trilogy of terror proved to me the producers and the writer of the teleplay who is richard matheson's son the writer of tot knew their mission with this one was to make the action deadly yet at the same time fun it took longer to get to hurt's apartment than it should have but i think it fulfilled it's objective 8 10 br br umney's last case liked this one primarily because of william h macy's performance i think the writer umney should have appeared in the story sooner into the private eye umney beginning because he was the actual reality of the story and anyone familiar with the king short story probably half if not more of the audience knew the chandleresque set up was due to get interrupted by the writer's reality so let's get on with it already and cut out the cute and clever hard boiled repartee' private dick banter already once the writer umney's family tragedy began to reveal though i thought the show developed an emotional connection that made the viewer me at least feel sympathy for the real life macy's attempt to escape his sorrows by usurping his fictional creation's exciting life 6 10 br br the end of the whole mess uh this title is how i felt about this episode when it was over after twenty minutes i was ready to scream at the tv ok we get it already the younger brother is a mega mensa genius prodigy extraordinaire we know from ron livingston talking to the camera time is running out for me not fast enough i thought that the young whiz kid is going to discover something really bad for humanity we know this because he's already built an airplane but almost died because he couldn't steer it out of the path of a tree and he blew up his chemistry lab while teaching himself chemistry to think the end of the world could have been prevented if only this kid had some more parental supervision so much time was wasted on establishing the uber genius of henry thomas when we finally get to the resolution of his discovery the end of the world through unintended idiocy how much do we get to see of the world ending a cheap video shot of a reporter starting to forget what she's reporting on and brief radio broadcasts announcing the day of judgement is at hand oh and the brother's parents drooling and singing old songs my point is if your story is really about the end of the whole mess world i wanna see the mess as it goes up in flames and crashes and burns talk about ending with a whimper indeed 2 10 br br crouch end this episode just ticked me off totally i could have lived with the taking forever exposition of the happy couple arriving at their hotel playing slap and tickle having lunch and getting a taxi that was half the episode right there if once they finally crossed over into crouch end the episode delivered the chills but it failed miserabley not only wasn't it scary it was practically laughable ooh look a kitty wait it turns oh my god look at it's scary eye uh huh they could have gone a long way towards filming the crouch end sequence at night instead of in daylight too things you might unintentionally find funny can become scarier when you see them in the night shadows but i guess the budget wasn't high enough to shoot at night on the fake london sets they slapped together for this one on the page this is a very scary story about tourists wandering into places they shouldn't and the terrible things that might lurk just around a corner there the only terror in this adaptation was the directing and acting those were truly horrifying 1 10 br br overall series average so far 4 10
comparison with american graffiti is inevitable so save your money and time by renting that timeless classic speaking of timeliness there was an episode of cheers where norm and cliff competed on who can find the most anachronism in a movie they would have loved this movie everything from some of the songs and some of the clothing were wrong there were sly reference such as 'they paved paradise to put up a parking lot' the filmmakers hoped to elicit some smiles from us but basically made me groan br br the characters in this movie are incredibly politically and socially astute for teenagers almost as smart as the people who were in their thirties and forties when they wrote the darn movie very little of what the characters said were believable combine the bad writing and bad acting this movie just totally fail although there were two exceptions kelli williams liven things up as the future flower child and despite what another reviewer said rick shroeder was quite good showing that brooding characteristic that would come to full boil in his eventual appearance in n y p d blues
if the crew behind zombie chronicles ever read this here's some advice guys br br 1 in a twist ending type movie it's not a good idea to insert close ups of every death in the movie in the opening credits that tends to spoil the twists y'know br br 2 i know you produced this on a shoestring and to be fair you worked miracles with your budget but please hire people who can actually act or at least walk talk and gesture at the same time joe haggerty i'm looking at you br br 3 if you're going to set a part of your movie in the past only do this if you have the props and costumes of the time br br 4 twist endings are supposed to be a surprise sure we don't want twists that make no sense but signposting the reveal as soon as you introduce a character that's not a great idea br br kudos to the guys for trying but in all honesty i'd rather they hadn't br br only for zombie completists
alicianne laurel barnett becomes a live in babysitter for young rosalie nordon rosalione cole who has recently lost her mother but rosalie misses her dead mother a lot and continuously visits her grave conveniently located in a cemetery right behind the house late at night where she also meets her friends br br this starts off good with a truly eerie sequence in the cemetery then falls apart the story is thin and there is tons of padding to make the film 85 minutes long the acting is terrible across the board with cole easily being the worst badly directed with some of the worst editing i've ever seen in a motion picture scenes and sound are just cut off with no rhyme or reason also the film has terrible and obvious post production sound br br as for blood and violence forget it there's very little and what there is looks incredibly fake i've never seen such fake looking blood looks like ketchup boring pointless a rightfully forgotten drive in movie you can skip this one
i moved out here to get away from this kind of thing the small town sheriff laments br br this happens a lot in chicago his deputy asks br br well no not really the plot is that a group of martians mistake a halloween rebroadcast of orson welles' war of the worlds as an account of a real martian invasion and conclude they need to get in on the action what follows are a bunch of mishaps involving the martian's haphazard attempts to conquer the town of big bean il everyone concludes they are kids in really good costumes except for the sheriff's daughter and her friend a kid in a duck suit br br the martians themselves are comical and you get the impression they are no threat to anyone but themselves pretty early on it's a fun family movie
before sunrise has many remarkable things going on almost too many to fit into one review like this but it's suffice to say that it's one of the most observant character studies of the nineties maybe even in all of contemporary cinema to be observant not about love per say so much as it's about a human connection how does one fall in love at first sight no one does at least that's deep down the consensus that linklater wants to show with his film and yet there is the possibility of as intense a connection of a bond that can form in those that are young and with many ideas that can be expressed articulately and with a breadth of cynicism and is somehow very tender and true at the same time linklater here gives us the story of celine and jessie a french girl and an american boy who get off the same train heading to vienna and on the way there start to talking about things at first arbitrary then personal jessie seeing death for the first time in his great grandfather jessie persuades celine to go along with him on a night out on the 'town' in vienna until his plane the next morning br br before sunrise gives jessie and celine in the midst of the gorgeous vienna scenery and locales to go on and on about subjects that have a lot of importance and in a sense is about the act of having conversations of what it's like to watch people having one leading into another and another here it's often about relationships and commitments as jessie and celine tell stories sometimes somewhat inconsequential or seemingly so and another that may tell a lot about their essential qualities we hear confessions of desires for other loves or what weren't really loves of being part of a family or part of an upbringing that may or may not inform how you'll love your life of what it means to believe or not believe in some religious form or just to have some connection to any faith and the soul i loved the bit about the quakers in the church and sometimes laced with cynicism or skepticism jessie may be more responsible for that last part but what's fascinating about the film is that it's never exactly cynical itself just commenting upon cynicism that lays in the concerns of men and women at that age of their lives br br meanwhile it's always great to see ethan hawke and julie delpy in these roles where they're not incessantly annoying in that 90s generation x mode but are the kinds of people where if not in the central conceit of the film which isn't a bad one at all but a necessary one one might think to find walking along the streets of a city somewhere the conceit is that of an old romantic picture ala brief encounter only here intimacy is expressed in the central characters either between each other where sweet asides are actually acceptable i have to tell you a secret jessie says and then leans in for a kiss ho ho or in the little moments that pop up with other people along the way i loved the scene with the poet where it's very cinematic a thing to suddenly find a random romantic bit player in the midst of a romantic picture with such beautiful words at his disposal or with the palm reader and how the reactions from jessie and celine are that we might share but really are seeing them do it first hand all the while hawke and delpy embody the roles interestingly we can see how neuroses are being formed already for their adult lives as it may lead off into the future br br featuring splendid cinematography and a script with an ear for natural wit and a true sense of what it means to have a moment of happiness however self contained as it may lead into something more who's to say you can't suddenly be attached to someone if only for less than 24 hours and be that much more attached than a married couple this is perhaps linklater's thesis but there's more to it than just that it's a very dense film and one that will have me calling back to it repeatedly one scene especially which is both cheesy and brilliant is when the two of them are talking 'on the phone' in front of each other mimicking their expositions might go to the other's friend a
here's an oddity a modern day film about a serial killer that has no fight scenes nobody seen dying no car chases and no loud noises and it takes place in russia there are only two short action scenes but they are horrific br br the rest of the story is detective work and how much red tape the poor detective had to go through to solve the murders this is a very somber movie and somber best describes the personality of the hero stephen rea as well yet the story is not depressing and it's very interesting all the way through br br rea is outstanding as the determined harried looked detective jeffrey demunn is downright scary as the killer donald sutherland's russian accent is suspect but he plays the only character in this film that has some warmth br br once again the story is dotted with liberal agendas here and there with not one but two references to bias against gays the total validity of secular psychology police and government officials being boorish crude bigoted yadda yadda yadda br br otherwise it's an intelligent and refreshingly low key crime film this is a somewhat unique film that probably is not well known but is well liked by the people who have seen it since it's based on a true life account of this killer it's all the more chilling don't pass this by just because you haven't anything about it
even without speaking a word billy connely is wonderful as a zombie carrie ann moss as mom even better zombie girlfriends br br my father thied to eat me i never tried to eat timmy br br and i thought dawn of the dead was good it's kinda like airplane meets meats night of the living dead sponsored by zomcom br br and don't forget my head coffin br br and fido in an aloha shirt is just way cool br br and yes the social comment is just too much to even begin to comment on br br sufice it to say it all really works
a noted cinematic phenomenon of the late eighties and early nineties was the number of oscars which went to actors playing characters who were either physically or mentally handicapped the first was marlee matlin's award for children of a lesser god in 1986 and the next ten years were to see another best actress award holly hunter for the piano in 1994 and no fewer than five best actor awards dustin hoffman in 1988 for rain man daniel day lewis in 1989 for my left foot al pacino in 1992 for scent of a woman tom hanks in 1994 for forrest gump and geoffrey rush in 1996 for shine for portrayals of the disabled matlin who played a deaf woman is herself deaf but all the others are able bodied br br this phenomenon aroused some adverse comment at the time with suggestions being made that these awards were given more for political correctness than for the quality of the acting when jodie foster failed to win best actress for nell in 1994 some people saw this as evidence of a backlash against this sort of portrayal my view however is that the majority of these awards were well deserved i thought the 1992 award should have gone to either clint eastwood or robert downey rather than pacino but apart from that the only one with which i disagreed would have been hanks' and that was because i preferred nigel hawthorne's performance in the madness of king george in that film of course hawthorne played a character who was mentally ill br br my left foot was based upon the autobiography of the irish writer and painter christy brown brown was born in 1931 one of the thirteen children of a working class dublin family he was born with cerebral palsy and was at first wrongly thought to be mentally handicapped as well he was for a long time incapable of deliberate movement or speech but eventually discovered that he could control the movements of one part of his body his left foot hence the title he learned to write and draw by holding a piece of chalk between his toes and went on to become a painter and a published novelist and poet br br life in working class dublin in the thirties and forties could be hard and the city jim sheridan himself a dubliner shows us here is in many ways a grim grey cheerless place very different from our normal idea of the emerald isle sheridan and day lewis were later to collaborate on another film with an irish theme in the name of the father against this however must be set the cheerfulness and spirit of its people especially the brown family much of christy's success was due to the support he received from his parents who refused to allow him to be institutionalised and always believed in the intelligence hidden beneath a crippled exterior and from his siblings we see how his brothers used to wheel him round in a specially made cart and how they helped their bricklayer father to build christy a room of his own in their back yard br br the film could easily have slid into sentimentality and ended up as just another heart warming triumph over adversity movie that it does not is due to a number of factors principally the magnificent acting in the course of his career day lewis has given a number of fine performances but this together with the recent there will be blood is his best he is never less than 100 convincing as christie his tortured jerky movements and strained attempts at speech persuade us that we really are watching a disabled person even though intellectually we are well aware that day lewis is able bodied the other performances which stand out are from fiona shaw as his mentor dr eileen cole from hugh o'conor as the young christy and from brenda fricker as christy's mother which won her the best supporting actress award br br the other reason why the film escapes sentimentality is that it does not try to sentimentalise its main character christy brown had a difficult life but he could also be difficult to live with and the film gives us a warts and all portrait he was a heavy drinker given to foul language and prone to outbursts of rage he could also be selfish and manipulative of those around him and the film shows us all these aspects of his character of course it also shows us the positive aspects his courage his determination and his wicked sense of humour day lewis's acting is not just physically convincing in that it persuades us to believe in his character's disability but also emotionally and intellectually convincing in that it brings out all these different facets of christy's character his oscar was won in the teeth of some very strong opposition from the likes of robin williams and kenneth branagh but it was well deserved 8 10
i think cliff robertson certainly was one of our finest actors he has a half dozen classics to his credit he does fine here as the heavy but the direction is so bad and the pacing so tiresome it never gets off the mark the story starts off well although it makes me wonder how he could count on his wife hanging herself still he mugs well and carries things along the death knell is twofold first of all if we were to take the amount of time characters spend walking from one room to another or one part of the house to another it would eat up about a third of the movie add to that robertson's character sitting up in bed in the blue light looking confused that might add another chunk i agree with those that said a half hour shorter would have made it a pretty decent though insignificant film the biggest weakness is just a convoluted plot that when all is said and done leaves incredible questions i'm not putting in spoilers but when it ends don't think too much i can come up with ten what ifs without raising a sweat it would have been better if it had remained a ghost story
ok so this is coming a few weeks late but it is here mostly this is because of statements of various negative natures starting with the technology when star trek tos ran special effect technology was extreamely low tec and more than that the crew had little money to do any kind of proper mock ups in the 35 years seince tos premiered the crew of star trek have become experts at economy br br ultimately they have decided quite rightly in my mind to abandon the look of tos and reverse engineered tng et all so what if they decided not to make the transporter out of gold glitter or made the phase pistols look closer to the ones from star trek ii as for the nits being picked about first contact with the klingon empire it was presumed based upon comments made by kirk and riker that earth only met the klingon's in 2200 nothing was firmly established br br enterprise gives us the most promising venue of exploration that we've seen in a while this is what voyager could have been no series can evolve without a few inconsistancies but be thankful that star trek has so few so quit gripping and enjoy
this movie should be required viewing for all librarians or would be librarians all of the best lines are directly related to librarianship the public library vs academic library argument is a classic argument waged among librarians and library school students it also breaks many librarian stereotypes librarians might even be capable of having fun even if they don't usually have sex in the romance languages section the best movie about librarians desk set with katherine hepburn and spencer tracy of course
this wasn't what i wanted to see i bought this on dvd and under the movie i found myself irritated and turned off the movie for a moment br br heres what i didn't like br br 1 they were shooting at the father br br 2 the tribes was really annoying br br 3 the dinosaurs mostly looked to faked br br 4 the bad scientist well he was annoying br br 5 the picture quality on the dvd was really bad br br what i did like br br 1 the music by jerry goldsmith this music is really great i have the bootleg soundtrack from this movie sadly the sound quality is not good but its ok for its time br br 2 the first time we see the dinosaurs they inspire a sort of awe br br 3 baby is kinda cute when he is in the water and is playing br br 4 that funny scene with the tent br br 5 the children who sees this film would hopefully learn that evil always loses
this is quite possibly the worst movie of all time it stars shaquille o'neil and is about a rapping genie apparently someone out there thought that this was a good idea and got suckered into dishing out cash to produce this wonderful masterpiece the movie gets 1 out of 10
the return of chandu is notable if one can say that for the casting of bela lugosi as the hero rather than the villain why he even gets the girl br br the story as such involves the black magic cult of ubasti trying to capture the last egyptian princess nadji the delectable maria alba and use her as a sacrifice as a means of reviving their ancient leader who just happens to look like nadji lugosi as chandu who possesses magical powers tries to thwart the villains br br director ray taylor does his best with limited resources and extensive stock footage fans of king kong 1933 will recognize the giant doors that were used to keep kong at bay in several scenes the acting is for the most part awful the actor who plays the high priest i believe lucien prival for example uses that acting coach inspired pronunciation that was so common in the early talkies the less said about the others the better br br it is a mystery why lugosi accepted parts in independent quickies at this stage of his career because he was still a bankable star at universal at this time maybe it was because in this case he got to play the hero and get the girl who knows as his career started to spiral downwards in the late 30s this kind of fare would become the norm for lugosi rather than the exception br br
oh dear this movie could have been sub titled when writers go on strike what a stinker i had really high hopes for this mostly after reading imdb reviews which makes me wonder about the whole imdb rating system but that's a separate matter i loved steve carrell in anchorman bruce almighty the office etc so i was expecting great things to say i was disappointed is the understatement of the year there are so many things wrong with this movie but i'll confine myself to a the implausibility of any family behaving like these people do a mass aerobics workout what planet is that real life on the clunky script a murderer of love please and the fact that the character of dan is so unlikable you find yourself wondering what the girl saw in him to make her fall in love with him this movie was filled to bursting with clunky dialogue creaking direction ridiculous set scenes and it was slow slow slow we would have walked out after half an hour if we'd not been with my parents who don't get out much and don't like to waste money unlike the makers of this movie who would have been better off throwing all the cash spent making this movie into a bonfire that would have been more entertaining if you like movies avoid this like the plague
although i recently put this on my 10 worst films list i have to say it's probably no worse than burt reynolds in the maddening or any of the look who's talking sequels still it's pretty nauseating even with sexy drew barrymore playing something of a horror movie answer to holly golightly relocating from new york city to los angeles but finding out she's being stalked by a murderous look alike poor sally kellerman a quirky actress of great acclaim in the '70s is reduced here to a paltry supporting role and barrymore's leading man george newbern is the worst type of sitcom actor always pausing for a laugh after every line the picture is swill but drew's bloody shower scene boasts showmanship and the identity of the psycho although right out of a scooby doo episode is interesting but as for the finale get real who had to clean up that mess from
a fashion designer trips over a cat and falls into a pool hitting her head on something floating on the surface with rather cheesy effects this was a tv movie she floats up out of her body she floats through a tunnel of rings of swirling orange smoke and black rigid figures tip into her view they look like the mannequins in her apartment i almost thought i was watching a jess franco movie as her friends revive her a black arm grabs her by the wrist and she has to struggle to get loose when she is revived she remembers everything and has a nasty bruise on her forearm br br shortly thereafter she nearly gets hit by an out of control car that comes up on the sidewalk behind her on halloween she decides with her boyfriend to go to mexico for a vacation when she gets there she's surprised to find it's the day of the dead they're annoyed by another american tourist who keeps following them and he almost drowns them br br the designer is encouraged to join a group of people who've had near death experiences they've all experienced the tunnel but not the black figures or the repeated near escapes from death one of them has and he's very anxious she's also encouraged to meet with a psychic br br a doctor tells her about people he calls walkers the name of the novel this was based on they're people who supposedly died of one cause that when examined prove to have died of another cause thus it's like they continued walking around after dying until they died again but he blames it on poor record keeping br br i watched this on the 102 minute video and it felt awfully long i can't imagine that there's actually a 192 minute version perhaps if it was meant to be watched over two or more nights on tv it would better be watched that way than in one sitting br br i've only read one gary brandner novel floater and if it is representative of his work he's not the most original of writers floater had the common plot of picked on kid kills people in revenge even the variation was pretty common picked on kid dies and kills people years later in revenge from beyond the grave and in fact it has a point in common with this movie in that the kid practices astral projection and when he is drowned he floats up out of his body as here i don't know how closely from the dead of night follows his novel walkers i understand the howling movies don't bear much resemblance to his novels br br it's quite a slow movie and the special effects and cinematography are really held down by the presumably low budget and made for tv shortcomings there are a lot of easily recognizable character actors in it it also feels very dated more early to mid 1980s than 1989 i found it to be boring a much better low budget movie covering similar subject matter that i don't think has dated as badly is sole survivor 1983 arguably the inspiration for the 2000s final destination movies it blows from the dead of night away
i watched this film not really expecting much i got it in a pack of 5 films all of which were pretty terrible in their own way for under a fiver so what could i expect and you know what i was right they were all terrible this movie has a few and a few is stretching it interesting points the occasional camcorder view is a nice touch the drummer is very like a drummer i e damned annoying and well thats about it actually the problem is that its just so boring in what i can only assume was an attempt to build tension a whole lot of nothing happens and when it does its utterly tedious i had my thumb on the fast forward button ready to press for most of the movie but gave it a go and seriously is the lead singer of the band that great looking coz they don't half mention how beautiful he is a hell of a lot i thought he looked a bit like a meercat all this and i haven't even mentioned the killer i'm not even gonna go into it its just not worth explaining anyway as far as i'm concerned star and london are just about the only reason to watch this and with the exception of london who was actually quite funny it wasn't because of their acting talent i've certainly seen a lot worse but i've also seen a lot better best avoid unless your bored of watching paint dry
i'm a huge fan of ivan reitman i loved evolution and who didn't like ghostbusters from the trailer you already know that uma's character will get dumped by luke's so the build up is obviously towards the moment when she unleashes her superpowers on him but the pay off is just not there the shark tossing did manage to get a slight giggle but once again it was all in the trailer br br no one does breathless quite like uma and luke is diet owen on his good days if not for riann wilson you would sit there with a constipated smile until your cheeks start to cramp this is a comedy right br br it's not awful it just sits there like a stale cracker behind the fridge this could have been such a brilliant send up of superhero movies and feminism but fails on both counts let's see if jason reitman can salvage the family name
not a bad word to say about this film really i wasn't initially impressed by it but it grew on me quickly i like it a lot and i think its a shame that many people can't see past the fact that it was banned in some territories mine being one of them the film delivers in the shock gore and atmosphere department the score is a beautiful piece of suspense delivering apparatus it only seems fair that chris young went on to be one of the best composers in the business the acting in this film is of a somewhat high standard if a little wooden in some spots and the effects are very real and gritty all of this is high praise for a good slasher film in my book i've noted in some reviews that the film has gotten serious flack having the famous killer's p o v shot and i ask what's wrong with that it is a classic shot that evokes dread into any good fan of the genre and is a great to keep the killer's identity a secret the only thing that stops this film getting top marks in my book is that the surprise twist killer revealed is not handled with more care i mean it just happens kind of quickly though the great performances make it just about credible aside from that pranks is a great movie though i prefer the original title and its a shame that so many people knock it off as just a cheap piece of crap its more than that but only few know that as it seems to have gotten lost in the haze of early 80s slasher what a shame its a really good movie people believe me
house of games is a flawlessly constructed film and one of the few films i have seen that had me gaping at the screen in astonishment at how cleverly and unexpectedly it ends i first saw it on video a few years back after reading roger ebert's review which proclaimed it the best film of 1987 i had my doubts mainly because it is not quite as well known as other films from that year boy was i in for a surprise this was one of the smartest most well written movies i had ever seen br br the screenplay is quite a piece of work not only in terms of the plot which twists and turns and pulls the rug out from under you just when you think you have it all figured out but also in terms of character development on my second viewing i began to realize that mamet's screenplay succeeds not only as a clever suspense film but that each plot development contributes to our understanding of the characters and their motivations the climax of the movie is particularly effective because it is absolutely inevitable it stems naturally from what we know about the characters and it is therefore much more than just an arbitrary twist ending the performances by lindsay crouse and joe mantegna also add enormously to the film i cannot picture any other actor besides mantegna playing the role of mike and crouse plays her role with just the right amount of restraint to suggest a repressed criminal mindset their work plus mamet's extraordinary screenplay combine to create one of the greatest films of the 1980's it is truly a must see
even though i'm quite young the beatles are my absolutely favourite band i never had the chance to hear their music as it was releases but have loved them since i can remember br br it's the sort of film that is worth trying the once i can see why it wasn't released in the cinema but it is certainly a great film to put on the tv i was flicking through my tv guide and happened to see this film it didn't much details except something like 'john lennon and paul mccartney meet after the beatles have broken up jared harris stars' i'd never heard of him he played john or aiden quinn who played paul however they are certainly underestimated actors br br the film had a slow start but as it developed i could see how well quinn but especially harris played their characters as a huge fan i sort of know what the real lennon and mccartney are like the script was brilliant and harris got lennon's accent personality and mannerisms spot on quinn played mccartney quite well but sometimes went into his irish accent the make up artists made them look excellent br br this paragraph may be counted as a spoiler br br as i mentioned before it got off to a slow start but soon developed and became quite an emotional film i found the bit in the park a total waste of time and quite out of character for both of the musicians as for lennon's rude line in the italian restaurant totally unnecessary the ending was very poignant and brings a tear to my eye whenever i watch it br br it is quite different from the other biographical films i've seen where it's about how the beatles got together and became famous and those never really did the characters that well e g 'backbeat' br br in conclusion i would say if you're a beatles or john lennon or paul mccartney fan give it a chance you may have pleasent surprise at only about 95 minutes long it's worth waiting for the film to develop br br if anyone does know whether the meeting of 1976 really did happen please send it to the 'comments page' for this film i'd be very interested
possible spoilers perhaps i must say that cinderella ii dreams come true is one of the worst movies ever made first of all the movie was made during the height of disney's sequel rampage it was created around the same time as the little mermaid ii the jungle book ii and peter pan ii all of which were disservices to their original film classics disney also made the hunchback of notre dame ii and atlantis ii but i'm going to drop that topic because their original movies were never really classics in the first place let me go ahead and say that i am an avid supporter of good disney films and i absolutely adore the original disney cinderella the sequel to cinderella however was a waste of time the character of cinderella in the sequel was so very unlike the original girl that i grew up watching in the original cinderella was kind and loving the new cinderella had very out of character moments with current era phrasing like i'm going to do this banquet my way let me also tell you that new cinderella as i have affectionately named her says ewww that is the anti cinderella i try to find the best in people but in the sequel anastasia one of the stepsisters is good what the heck why they made it all out to be like lady tremaine and drizella are just horrible family members for poor little anastasia my question to the world did the people at disney watch the original cinderella when making this sequel well it surely doesn't seem so if i remember correctly anastasia was just as abusive to cinderella as drizella and lady tremaine i am all for redemption and forgiveness but there was no point of redemption for anastasia in this movie in the first one anastasia was evil in the second one she is good one just can't leave a story like this i hope disney realizes that this movie among other movies is shaming walt disney's name perhaps now that michael eisner is gone things will start shaping up around the house of mouse
unlike the adventures of buckaroo banzai or big trouble in little china or conan the barbarian which are horrible films that have a certain coolness and self deprecating humor that turn them into cult sensations the golden child is just plain bad br br the premise itself is not unworkable and there are some funny moments but here the eddy murphy flip attitude just deflates any feeling of tension or danger in the story and the special effects are silly enough to do more damage to that tension the mystic secrets of tibetan buddhism are lampooned rather than drawn upon to compel br br without a feeling that anything is at stake or that the characters are faced by real danger why should we care br br who should see this film br br big fans of eddy murphy who can't help themselves br br i can't think of anyone else br br i'll give this film a 4 out of 10 for the occasional joke that worked
i was impressed that i could take my 5 year old son to this movie without having to cover his ears or eyes no sex scenes no profanity and not even any violence just good entertainment enjoyable from beginning to end dennis quaid pulls off this movie very well
i am very open to foreign films and like to think that i grasp what they are trying to accomplish although some things are lost in translation but the simplicity and intelligence of this film were boring i've often thought how interesting it would be to make a movie that just shows a typical day or time period that really had no point now that i've seen a movie like that i will no longer be thinking along those lines there's tones about society racism and some desire but south park has that and when i watch south park it actually moves me to feel an emotion the closest thing i felt to an emotion during this movie was the yawn i experienced after the first five minutes i rate the typical movie a seven or above because i love most every film i gave this film a one
in his otherwise excellent book lincoln in american memory the historian merrill peterson calls young mr lincoln a boring dreadful film this amazingly wrongheaded analysis simply proves that great historians are rarely fine film critics i am working on a doctoral dissertation on abraham lincoln and frederick douglass as part of my preparation for writing the dissertation i made a careful analysis of this film and of tag gallaghers brilliant interpretation of it in his seminal book on ford young mr lincoln comes out that culminating year of the first phase of ford's cinematic authorship 1939 in that greatest of hollywood years ford directed three superb still not fully appreciated films drums along the mohawk stagecoach and young mr lincoln it might seem odd to say that stagecoach is not fully appreciated all but the most purblind of critics must perceive that it is one of of the greatest westerns and perhaps even one of the hundred greatest films of all time however what is not fully appreciated is that these three films work together as a kind of trilogy a triptych in fact ford is creating a sort of mythic history of america on screen drums along the mohawk is the revolutionary war young mr lincoln is pre civil war america finally stagecoach is post civil war america what the three films have in common is that they are an extended meditation on the american adam and his errand into the wilderness what are the psychic and social costs of american manifest destiny as america strives to build a new human city in the wilderness lincoln symbolizes americas journey as he seeks to reconcile the civilizational inmpulse law with the freedom of the wilderness young mr lincoln is not history it is full of historical howlers' as both ford and trotti were well aware but myth this is lincoln the symbol of justice and mercy lincoln the man of the wilderness striving to found a civilization within himself and to become the remarkable lawgiver' of young america young mr lincoln is not history like james agee's long forgotten teleplay about lincoln and like sandburgs biography it is an epic poem a very beautiful epic poem
this one is a great one robert de niro and cuba gooding have teamed up to make a powerful and very influential film this is the true story of the first black us navy diver and the obstacles he faced in attaining his certification at the hands of a racist master diver along the way he must also face plain old bigotry from all of his classmates none of whom want him in their class they move out of the barracks when he arrives ultimately he becomes certified and goes on to have a great career as a us navy diver watch this one it's a great tale of courage and honor as the story unfolds we get to watch racism slowly dissipate and everyone begins to respect men one at a time
the best martial arts movie ever made this one movie is better than anything bruce lee ever did a classic with a thoroughly entertaining and brutal climax jackie chan is the king of martial arts movies and the true king of kung fu it's a great pity that whilst bruce lee had been so overrated it took jackie chan an eternity to become popular in europe and america jackie rules
i am very disappointed with k 911 the original good quality of k 9 doesn't exist any more this is more like a sitcom some of casts from original movie returned and got some of my memory back the captain of dooley now loves to hit him like a scene from old comedy show that was crazy what's the deal with the change of police it seems like they are now lapd not san diego pd it is a completely different movie from
miscasting happens susannah yorke is a luminous young jane eyre and her performance is impeccable however edward rochester is supposed to be 35 white haired george c scott looks and behaves like an arthritic 80 jane's deceased uncle is in better shape he creaks and snarls obnoxious and grim he looks like an ax murderer who has sent his ax out to be sharpened we're not surprised he keeps a wife caged in the attic the great love story looks like a sado masochistic nightmare there is enough darkness in the novel but bronte's rochester is relatively young athletic powerful and charming when he chooses to be he has a fine speaking and singing voice a good mind and a conscience that he unsuccessfully attempts to stifle
this film is awful the screenplay is bad the is script mediocre and even the sex scenes are worthless the thrill and intrigue of the original film are completely lacking this movie was shot in a dark shadowy and monochromatic style a la war of the worlds which is so disappointing after the beauty of the original film greg morrisey's brooding character displays one facial expression throughout the film the twists and turns of the original plot are woefully lacking here the few that do exist are simply anticlimactic the only highlight is sharon stone's performance as catherine tramell faithfully continued in this sequel but it isn't enough to make up for the other shortcomings the only circumstance under which a basic instinct 3 should be made would be if michael douglas agrees to join the cast
the movie was awful the theater was dead with silence 'cause everyone was embarrassed to be in there watching such trash i think someone gave jet li a lobotomy and made him perform a script with dialogue written by a five year old the martial arts are 'ok' but when put next to the jackie chan movies and the matrix you're better off seeing one of those
need i say its a stinker i gave it a rating of 2 br br only watch it if you suffer from insomnia br br there's plenty of scenery chewing and hamming it up but not much else happens in this movie there is no suspense no deep shocking secrets revealed no real threat to the heroine's well being a few disagreements slight raising of voices that's pretty much it the secrets are nothing that couldn't happen to anybody the last secret revealed in the film is totally predictable by that point br br the plot such as it is revolves around a young woman named faith meg tilly who is an artist who is hired to paint a series of mural panels in a huge ballroom in a vast mansion by a very very wealthy older widowed woman and a growing mother daughter type relationship that the older woman craves with her br br it turns out the older woman's daughter cassandra is dead you can pretty well fit the rest of the pieces together br br even the scene with the mysterious man menacing our heroine does not advance to the point where you really fear for her safety beyond maybe a second or two why he's still hanging around years after cassandra's death is a good question br br there's also the question of the fact that in this vast mansion there is only one servant a faithful butler who seems to do everything cooking cleaning serving the meal answering the door etc everything except apparently locking the door since that would be the only explanation for how one of the characters just walks into a room where faith is br br there's nothing that will have you grasping your chair arms and leaning forward on the edge of your seat because there is no mounting tension in this film just bland pathetic revelations that get tossed out from time to time br br
i watched full house when i was younger and i can not understand why i did i don't remember really enjoying the show i think i and the majority of americans watching this were hypnotized by its badness it will put you in a trance state and there is no going back i am still scarred but i try to move on i know it's a family show but that does not mean it has to be so bad the show is so cliché with every episode ending with a talk from the dad to make everyone's problems go away the characters on the show are all loathsome there is a know it all cleaning obsessed corny father who you want to punch in the face every time he comes on screen we then have a supposed rocker uncle that is just there to look pretty for the moms that have to watch this crap we have another uncle who is completely unfunny who does lame bullwinkle impressions need i say more about him there is the eldest daughter who can not act and is always whining about something then a middle daughter who always says how rude to pretty much everything anyone says finally there is the youngest daughter michelle do not get me started on michelle played but the horrible actors known as the olsen twins if you believe in christianity i guess you would associate her with the antichrist she is always demanding things trying too hard to be cute is constantly saying duh and rolling her eyes which makes you want to smack her i am not a big fan of using a lot of physical abuse as punishment to children but in her case i would make an acceptation she needed it on a daily basis she is the most selfish character to ever be introduced to mainstream television one example of this is when her rocker uncle is busy doing his job in the attic the brat decides to constantly annoy him and demand attention he yells at her and she gets upset poor baby the rest of the episode is catering to her emotional needs and the uncle eventually apologizes to her ugghh the show will lower your iq along with slowly destroying your will to live i am surprised we don't hear in the news about full house being played in the background when police find people that have committed suicide do yourself a favor and do not watch reruns of the show you will thank me later
what can i say i know this movie from start to finish it's hilarious it's an strong link to my past and will change the way i view film in the future hypothetically speaking the down fall there's no socrates johnson
liked stanley iris very much acting was very good story had a unique and interesting arrangement the absence of violence and porno sex was refreshing characters were very convincing and felt like you could understand their feelings very enjoyable movie
at first look of the plot tagline i figured it could have been a decent film could i have ever been more wrong the beginning of the film makes it look like a bunch of freaks got together and decided to make a low budget film for the first 10 minutes you don't notice the cheesy acting horrible sound and god awful special effects but then it gets worse just about 20 minutes into it i was asking myself what was the plot again i could only ask that question when i wasn't busted out laughing from the sheer lameness of this film the main actor has one setting for emotions and he sticks to it throughout the entire film even though he was supposed to go through love and hate and everything in between the flashback scene almost made me vomit because it made me re live one extra minute of footage from earlier in the movie now we hit the middle of the film where they are obviously trying to rip off morpheus from the matrix although he is doing just a horrible job the actor's talking about star wars and fortune cookie phrases is almost unbearable now at the end of the movie you don't realize that it's the end of the movie because you actually think the plot is finally developing the morpheus character dies the only good thing about the movie he utters a couple words and the credits roll what is this no plot bad acting cheesy everything it couldn't get any worse please if you value human decency do not watch this movie
i saw the omen when i was 11 on tv i enjoyed the trilogy so when the chance to finally see one at the cinema came around i didnt pass it up i went in to the cinema knowing that what i was about to see wasnt a cinema release but a made for tv film however being a fan i couldnt resist but this omen movie which i saw at a midnight screening didnt bring chills it brought laughter risible dialogue such as it is written that if a baby cries during baptism they reject there god what nonsense no decent set pieces faye grant so good in v is wasted with this script from hell no suprises and no fun however i did laugh out loud several times at our bad it was truly pathetic 1 out of 10
just after the end of wwii powell pressburger were asked to come up with something to try to heal the rift developing between the uk the usa at the time there was a lot of overpaid over sexed and over here type of comments somehow they came up with this masterpiece br br my favourite movie of all time it's got everything romance poetry emotion religion drama and very quirky br br i can never explain exactly why but it hits all the right buttons and although i've seen it hundreds of times yes really i'm still guaranteed to be in tears at many points throughout br br was it the magnificent acting the wonderful sets the inspired script who knows but do watch it and you'll see what i mean
let me confess i found this video used and bought it because guttenberg looked so sexy in his underwear on the jacket but inside was another story besides the fact that the movie was basically a parody of invisible man genre special effects highly visible strings and other such paraphernalia the script wasted no chance in fact it went out of its way in insulting all non wasp races and real or imagined homosexuals every insult aimed at a person in the script was either homophobic or racist or both it starts to grate on your nerves along with the shaky sound candid camera style photography and melodramatic story however the end is somewhat of a surprise but by the time you get there you hardly care less too bad it could been a reasonably good movie
this film exhibits artful cinematic techniques wherein instead of landscape capturing the attention of the camera it is small details in how someone appears how the woman may be wearing a cocktail hat and wrapped in a sheet how the husband may be wearing a hat and socks and shoes and his underwear and both seem so completely at ease and comfortable how provocative the woman is posed is another feature of the tableau that the director chooses to let us know she is a free spirit sexually and aims to get the pleasure she seeks without flirting directly or with any particular sensitivity to what the man may be feeling the relationship between the wife and husband is unique it is an open one wherein she holds nothing back feels no particular shame for how she has behaved and wants to share these facts with him because her primary focus always is on the fact of their marriage nothing and no one can come between the two of them only the chances of fate can intervene his imprisonment during the war and what follows after his return at long last a very intriguing film which is totally absorbing
although i was in this movie playing the part of sheriff hodges it still managed to make me jump in several places and believe me i'm not that easy you might say that i'm biased about the film and ok i am but i didn't see the finished product until 12 27 2006 and was extremely pleased i'm not a horror film fan as such but love the old b movies and black and white sci fi films this movie will make you think you know when something is going to happen then it doesn't then it does it will keep you completely off balance i would suggest watching the movie first then the director's notes and special features it is so well written directed and filmed and i can tell you personally that it was a real joy to work with this cast and crew i sincerely hope to be part of brian and laurence's future projects
disjointed unclear bad screenplay poor photography and direction all in all very obviously an ill conceived first effort at commercial film making by the good people at tbn br br tbn pictures has had great success in the past by helping to bring china cry the story of nora lam to the big screen but the omega code is an unfortunate miscue as a christian who supports tbn and a lot of its programming and who loved china cry i still find it impossible to recommend this film to anyone they do much good with their ministry but this isn't an example of it don't waste your money go rent china cry instead
lolita is a rebel and she's going to share to our wide open eyes some little sex stories between sci fi and fantasy well this surrender cinema production is not very good very bad acting horrifying music and a story line without any story and any line but the sex scenes are pretty well done lot of lesbian scenes and jacqueline lovell as beautiful as in the exotic house of wax offer to us a very good final and very hot strip show for lovell's fans only
this is the third parody of the scary movies and hopefully the last this time the spoof is mainly on the ring signs and 8 mile for some weird reason in my opinion this movie was very pointless and unnecessary and not even funny i laughed maybe three times and that is not enough for a comedy i really enjoyed the first two but this one was just plain dumb if your jokes consist of corpses getting beat up and people constantly throwing stuff at each other then this movie is for you in my opinion if your smart enough stay at home and save your money and please stop making these kind of movies they just keep getting worse 3 10
i should preface this by stating that i am a dolph lundgren fan the man turns out some of the funniest action clichés imaginable and detention is probably my personal favorite spoiler even though there is no such thing as a dolph spoiler since the scripts are so absurd to begin with a chase scene with a handicapped kid carrying a pistol versus a guy on a harley with a sub machine gun through a high school hallway and the kid wins good game the oscar goes to detention dolph if you're reading this thanks for the laughs old friend br br in summary terrific movie that is a guaranteed laugh i recommend inviting some friends over for this and forcing them to sit through it hilarious
take a pinch of goodfellas mix it with the godfather add some roman mythology and plenty of lowbrow comedy and you have the sopranos about a mob clan operating out of northern new jersey it's almost as entertaining as pro wrestling i am not the biggest fan of this show but i do admire james gandolfini's very complicated tony soprano a psychopath with an occasional glimmer of conscience i also have come to admire te contributions of folks like gravel voiced dom chianese as the bewildered but murderous uncle junior silver haired tony sirico as the perpetually perplexed paulie and the very beautiful edie falco as the duplicitous tough as nails carmela soprano the violence is sudden and graphic the body count steadily climbs each season but it is often the small moments that matter most here watch paulie and tony's nephew christopher michael imperioli late of law order as they get lost in the pine barrens and sit out a bitter cold night in an abandoned trruck both convinced they've had it
i have to confess right off that i have never been a fan of rodney dangerfield indeed from me he gets no respect i watched this only because my wife wanted to see it and found exactly what i expected a stupid story without any real humour it's full of lame crude jokes and a totally ridiculous plot revolving around a developer's dangerfield plans to build a ski resort in utah that just didn't capture my attention at all br br in addition to dangerfield the film starred a weak cast including the likes of andrew dice clay and the totally over the hill john byner i didn't even know he was still around until i saw his name in the credits for this br br this truly is a dangerfield disaster br br 2 10
i just sat in the theater bored as hell i wanted to leave halfway through the movie the plot is simple 4 samoan guys wreck weddings so they have to bring a dates in order to get into the wedding yawn br br the thing that peeved me off the most was the so called crude jokes they were highly unfunny clichéd and thrown in your face to make you get into the already dull movie the acting was below average and i felt this movie just went on and on about nothing but a bunch of unfunny jokes and a predictable plot br br all in all one of the worse movies i've seen of 2006 unfunny bad acting just ugly br br well thank god a friend shouted me br br avoid
this movie had what sounded like a good premise 9 people facing their fears to win one million dollars unfortunately it did not turn out to be a good movie there are several scenes that are way too long and really pointless like the dancing scene a few scenes are just an excuse to point the camera at female body parts the acting is bad but some of the lines are amusing in their awfulness what's really strange is that towards the end of the movie it turns into like a 5 minute western and at the end the twists of which their were several don't make sense with the rest of the movie it seemed as though the director just added stuff on because he thought it would look cool while conveniently ignoring the plot of the movie up to that point it just didn't make a lot of sense the only creepy thing was the old people dancing down the hall but that doesn't even come close to making up for the rest of this mess
i found it very very difficulty to watch this after the initial 5 minutes of the film i managed to stomach 45 50 minutes before switching it off in disgust and watching monster house instead which by the way is great fun br br the story has massive holes in it the plot line is hugely over stated and dull the acting is awful especially from justin timberlake who should really stick to what he is good at looking daft and singing like a castrato morgan freeman looked incredibly uncomfortable especially when made to dance around to rock music for no apparent reason half way through the film after him and timberlake meet freeman and timberlake's characters seem to be supposed to have some sort of father son relationship of sorts or something which simply isn't evident at all apart from the fact that though freeman's character seems to have nothing but contempt for the ignorant and rather stupid character of timberlake he never the less pulls out all the stops to help him uncover a completely ridiculous cover up br br it would take some incredible suspension of disbelief to give any credit to the story line which is simply absurd and blown out of all proportion br br don't watch this film it is a pure waste of time
polanski returns to the themes of solitude and madness which he explored to such tremendous effect in repulsion and rosemary's baby in the tenant br br the atmosphere is trademark polanski dark brooding unnerving but there is something awkward about this movie and i am not sure whether or not it is deliberate br br sven nykvist who was responsible for some of bergman's most beautiful films doesn't quite do himself justice here as his name was one of the things which really attracted me to this movie i was a little disappointed in how few instances of truly impressive cinematography are in the film br br the only thing that really lets the movie down is the acting polanski is certainly not a bad actor but he seems to have bitten off more than he can chew with the difficult role of trelkovsky some of the supporting cast are great notably melvyn douglas as the landlord and shelley winters as the concierge but others are weak and miscast it is also hard to get past the fact that all these supposed parisians have american accents br br quite unexpectedly there are some fine moments of dark comedy in the film anyone who has seen the fearless vampire killers knows that polanski is certainly a good comedic actor however there are moments when it slips dangerously close to being a parody of itself trelkovsky's sudden and somewhat unexplained 'transformation' is more likely to raise giggles than eyebrows which detracts from what should have been a powerful moment in his psycho dramatic journey br br all in all the tenant is an enjoyable and intriguing experience if a little too languorous for its own good there's a handful of exceptionally chilling moments and a consistently uncomfortable and foreboding atmosphere but this film while being very good does not quite hit the mark as successfully as it could have br br alas at the end of the day an 'okay' polanski movie is still better than most other 'good' movies definitely worth a watch just don't expect to be blown away
the notorious bettie page written by mary harron guinevere turner directed by mary harron br br how do you define a person who has always been between two worlds one of presumed sin and one of supposed redemption especially when that person eventually succumbed to a split personality disorder in her latter years as if to demonstrate her own point if you're director mary harron you don't shy away from showing the push pull nature of the notorious bettie page you allow the character to drift back and forth between the healing forgiveness of the power of god and the church and the seductive illusion of control and dominance afforded to page during her years as a pinup model by doing so audiences are offered a complex character that is propelled forward by a desire to leave her difficult past with a naive enjoyment in others' lust for her and a struggle to reconcile her image in the eyes of god come the right time it will no longer matter how many eyes are on her because there is only one pair that counts br br shot mostly in black and white with some unnecessary bursts of color the notorious bettie page is at times a light humorous comedy making the film an enjoyable experience and also one that pokes fun at how seriously people believe in the corruption of pornography but the delicate hand of the director is more palpably felt during page's times of despair harron is a sensitive considerate director who does not throw page's numerous and devastating blows of abuse in the face of her viewer instead she allows the surprisingly effective gretchen moll who plays the title role the chance to hammer the pain of her character into the viewer with fear in her eyes exhaustion is her cries and shame on her skin whereas most directors perhaps most male directors would find it essential to show the heroine in painful positions in order to draw a link between the kinds of atrocities that were put upon her and where her life took her harron has too much compassion for her character her actress and her audience from fragility page learns to trust people again and as more and more photographers fall in love with her image the more she falls in love with their admiration and the control she has over the gaze by the time her poses cross over into the realm of soft core s m she has found a way to combine her need to be respected with the objectification she has been accustomed to her whole life br br mary harron's bettie page is a woman who yearns for control over her life and destiny yet ultimately is always being told where to stand how to smile and what to wear when she finally realizes that none of her choices have been her own she chooses to embrace god and preach his word to those who will listen the true sadness behind this most important decision is that she is still letting someone else guide her blindly she just has more faith that this direction will be better for her soul

macarthur is a great movie with a great story about a great mangeneral douglas macarthur this is of course the story of one of america's great military figures and a figure made familiar to me from the earliest moments of my memory though there is a continuity issue there may be others e g macarthur's speech portrayed in the film as his 1962 address to the u s military academy on accepting the thayer award did not contain the phrase old soldiers never die they just fade away that was in his speech to congress upon his dismissal by president truman in 1951 for his alleged insubordination these two did not see eye to eye gregory peck is im peck able as the general who vowed he would return to the philippines in world war ii the film moves quickly and easily with the general his family and his staff from the beginning of the second world war to the end of his service career this film would be of much greater significance to one familiar with both ww ii and the korean war nevertheless peck's portrayal of this great man who fought the twin evils of fascism and communism and who hated war as only a soldier can is a memorable one indeed in war there is no substitute for victory

this was a disappointing movie considering the material army life is always good for a laugh and the stars this movie should have been a fall down laughfest it was worth a couple of chuckles at best steve martin has been much funnier than this and it appears that dan ackroyd should stick to dramatic roles where he might follow robin williams' lead and someday win an oscar
bsg is one of my all time favourite tv series i was lucky enough to start watching it as the series came to it's final season it was a marathon from start to finish for me and what an incredible ride it was br br as soon as i noticed the pilot on hulu i knew exactly what i was in for just by the title caprica although some things don't add up when you compare both series it is still beautifully executed there were no mention about the holobands in battlestar galactica or the mention of virtual worlds but maybe i haven't got far enough into the series for them to explain why br br i recommend this show to anyone who loves the universe technology and alternate fantasies of our world this show is very interesting and will have you wanting to watch more
follow the fleet an rko production in 1936 stars fred astaire and ginger rogers in a complex romantic comedy although fred astaire and ginger rogers have had many similar romantic movies together rko helped them to once again create a worth while storyline that incorporates relevant situations to society at the time it was made the narrative of follow the fleet relies heavily on the use of layered story lines between the two sets of main characters to create a satisfying romantic comedy br br the general plot of the movie revolves around bake baker a sailor in the u s navy played by fred astaire and sherry martin bake's former love and dance partner who is now a singer and dancer played by ginger rogers their story begins when bake is on the ship and his shipmate bilge smith finds a photo of the two of them together and bake reveals that the last time he saw her he had asked her to marry him so bilge suggests that they try and meet up with her when they are on land in hopes that she might have a friend br br the next major scene begins the second plot of the movie when connie martin sherry's sister is refused entry into paradise where her sister works unless she is escorted by a gentleman she turns around to find bilge behind her with a bag full of beverages so she plays it off like she was waiting on him and buys his entrance into paradise as well connie then finds sherry and tells her that she is depressed because she cannot have the luck sherry does with men so sherry suggests she get a makeover from her friends while she is performing on stage connie gets made over and enters the ballroom once again and approaches bilge again who is awestruck by the sight of her this commences the second romantic storyline between bilge and connie br br throughout the remainder of the movie the story and rising actions are transitioned between altering comedic reliefs of the two couples' troubles that create several mini rising and falling actions within the overall plot bake and sherry hit it off their first moments together as they compete in a dance competition and end up winning it reminding them of the success and pleasure the two have when they are together similarly bilge is able to swoon connie through his romantic attempts of pleasing her and they retire to her house br br this series of happy events is soon followed by unsettling measures that brings the rising action back down bake left sherry the previous night to retire to the ship before midnight and told her that he would come for her in the morning unfortunately the ship sets course after the shipmates have returned upsetting sherry and leaving her to think bake was still being a typical sailor looking for a good time when he's on land br br the mood is again changed as another subplot is entered into the film when a party of big shots is taking a tour of the ship this alternate storyline is used to create a buffer between the stories of the two main relationships of the film as well as help build confidence and fondness of bake's overall good intentions the party is interrupted by the oblivious music playing coming from bake and his companions when they missed the sounding to report on deck for the company the ladies are intrigued and ask to hear them play and bake gladly begins to entertain them with some dancing which ultimately helps brighten the mood of the film as well as bring happiness to the sailors br br after returning to the couple's intertwined stories sherry is trying to prove to bake that she does not need his help with landing a job unfortunately bake is unaware that she is auditioning and goes to put in a good word for sherry when he overhears his friend at the studio talking about the remarkable lady auditioning bake takes it upon himself to help sherry out by tampering with her water making her unable to sing correctly and destroying her audition in addition to bake's mistake connie spent all of her money to repair a ship that she was hoping bilge would take over as captain she had also planned a remarkable dinner date for him when he was supposed to come over but bilge was aware of her intentions and hopes of soon marrying and was no longer interested so he stood her up br br the remainder of the movie continues in the same format of mini rising and falling actions until the climactic point is reached between the two couples ending the movie with the happiness of both couples the use of the altering stories helps to build interest and emotion within each couple as they deal with both happiness and pain through each of their struggles the intertwining stories are also able to relate with one another as well as incorporate other unrelated subplots to help carry the narrative through to the concluding scenes br br although fred astaire and ginger rogers have countless films together that incorporate romance comedy song and dance follow the fleet is a unique film for the two actors that successfully use the technique of subplots to aid the narrative between the two main characters
54 is a film about a club with that very title in the setting of the 70s era it features the classic good looking bartender the sexy females the high powered owner the partying when all entwined together chaos ensues and the bartender played by phillipe seems to be at the brunt of it all br br i'm going to be as blunt and honest as possible whilst avoiding any outright unfair or untrue comments like it's an 'ok' film i really do find it a completely dire film complimented by it's dire cast every time i sit down to watch a film casting salma hayek i am always awaiting to see her beauty radiantly expressed simultaneously with a great performance but reality invariably reminds me quite abruptly how utterly talentless she is i mean really what has she ever bequeathed the masses with other than her immense table dance in 'from dusk till dawn' the same goes for ryan phillippe another poor actor who gives nothing to the screen but his good looks and insanely dull facade otherwise known as 'acting' mike myers isn't quite as bad as these 2 he does at least give the film something worthy playing the seedy extroverted co founder of the 54 club the type that the majority watching would hate i e job well done he puts in a somewhat convincing performance that gave me rare enjoyment from the flick but alas it is not enough to rescue the film from it's baseless and flat nothingness most 'bad' bad films i find something to take from the film but this has nothing to it really neve campbell isn't too bad but she is just 'there' the storyline is dull it appears the writer was more bent on making a film of this style and embellishment and forgot to add anything else any meaning any class anything at all because like most ornaments they are just hollow pointless objects that are merely pretty to look at much akin to the basis of this disastrous film br br genuinely an hour and a half of time i could have spent better doing something much more exciting like talking to 90 year old relatives on the phone about the weather
i saw this film at the toronto international film festival filmed during an actual qualifying match for the 2006 world cup offside works brilliantly as both a comedy and a tragedy the film follows the fortunes of a group of young women who are caught trying to sneak into a football match at tehran's azadi stadium the country's islamic religious leaders have decreed that women may not sit with men at sporting events lest they be exposed to cursing and other morally questionable behaviour this hasn't stopped the country's young female fans who continue to sneak in using various tricks but panahi focuses on a small group who have been caught and are being detained agonizingly close to the action they beg the bored soldiers guarding them to let them go or at least to let them watch the match the soldiers tell them they shouldn't have tried to get in that they could have watched the game at home on tv they banter back and forth in almost real time as the game continues just off camera br br there is one very funny sequence where a young soldier accompanies one of the girls to the restroom since there are no female restrooms at stadiums he has to clear the room of any men before he can allow her to go in plus he makes her cover her face so no one can see she's a woman this is accomplished using a poster of iranian soccer star ali daei as a mask with eye holes punched out br br you get a real sense that even the soldiers are baffled by the prohibition and are only carrying out their orders so as to hasten the end of their compulsory military service one soldier complains that he was supposed to be on leave so he could take care of his family's cattle in the countryside little by little the girls and the soldiers talk to each other and there are numerous small acts of kindness on both sides to show that these are basically good people living in terrible circumstances however the soldiers' constant reminder that the chief is on his way lends a sense of menace since we don't know what sort of punishment the women will face br br unlike most iranian films which are known for their strong visuals offside is filmed in a realist style with no artifice in fact the film was made during the actual qualifying match against bahrain that took place on june 5 2005 the plot in many ways was determined by the result on the pitch if iran won the match they would qualify if they lost they would not since the world cup has come and gone i don't think it is a spoiler to say that iran won the match the scenes of celebration at the end of the film were real and spontaneous which gave the film a real authenticity seeing how much this meant to the people of iran was deeply touching br br as well one of the young women makes reference at the end of the film to seven fans who died during the iran japan match on march 25 just a few weeks before they were trampled to death after police began to spray the crowd with water to move them in a certain direction knowing that this was a real life tragedy added another level of poignancy to the celebrations br br i don't want to go off on a long political tangent but this film gave me real hope that there are those in iran who are hoping for change and working at it iran is a nation of young people and it is only a matter of time before they take the place of their elders in the political sphere films like this one show the proud spirit of the iranian people in spite of their present difficulties and it's my sincere hope that there is a brighter future for them
as soon as i heard about this film i knew i had to check it out well i heard about it then i found the trailer after that that's when i knew i had to see it and i am so glad i did you want to see classic television mixed with zombies no then get lost br br fido is a movie unlike anything i've ever seen well actually it kind of is it's kind of like a lassie episode and a zombie film though when combined it feels completely new and original fido is about a little boy named timmy and his new pet fido well this new pet ain't no squawking parakeet or some potty trained puppy it's a re animated dead guy a zombie a large radiation cloud engulfed earth which led to all of the dead rising which ensued the zombie wars though through the genius of reinhold giger lead scientist of zomcon he discovered that if you destroy the brain the zombie will perish thus giving us the edge and the win in the zombie war though due to lingering radiation whoever dies becomes a zombie which can be a problem especially with the elderly though zomcom steps up again with more breakthroughs especially with the domestication collar the collar stops the zombie's need for human flesh and thus making it harmless as a household pet but not all is perfect in this zombie utopia collars break old people die and well i'll just let you watch this incredibly unique flick br br fido is a fantastic idea brought to fruition with an all star cast and great writing fido rises above most in the comedy horror genre there are plenty of funny and original situations that really had me entertained though after seeing the film i personally think the movie would have been better in black and white at less than 90 minutes the movie doesn't go on for too long and moves from scene to scene at a good rate it'll probably end up being a cult classic of sorts since it's not really a laugh out loud comedy or even a horror movie it's a comedy family zombie film immersed in the 1950 vibe if you thought anything i said here was interesting by all means check this film out but if you're still on the fence swing your leg back over and stay there 8 5 outta 10
honestly this is easily in the top 5 of the worst movies i have ever seen partly because it takes itself so seriously as opposed to regular light hearted trash this movies wants you to be emotionally involved to feel for the characters and to care about the alleged conspiracy none of this ever even comes close to happening br br mild spoilers br br there are 3 main reasons why this movie is so terrible 1 incoherent and totally non sensical plot 2 annoying style over substance mtv camerawork 3 moronic characters and plot holes br br allow me to elaborate br br 1 apparently when this movies was being made they couldn't decide whether to make a movie about church conspiracies the stigmata or possession so guess what they combined them an aetheist gets possessed by a dead person who then makes her exhibit the stigmata so as to expose a church conspiracy how a regular person is able to transcend death and possess another human being through his rosary is never explained nor even talked about now instead of just saying what he wants to say he gives her the stigmata why why not just spit it out instead we get treated to scenes of screaming things in harsh voices carving cryptic messages on cars and writing messages on walls apparently this priest was also a violent guy because the possessed young lady also wigs out on one o f the characters while talking in that cliched harsh possessed voice that we all have heard countless times this also starts to tie into my second complaint because whenever the young lady gets the stigmata she also defies the laws of gravity by floating into the air and tossing everything and everybody around her as if they were in an earthquake why does this happen who knows my guess is that the director thought it looked cool br br 2 this movies contains dozens of shots in slow motion of course of birds showing up out of nowhere and flying off and most annoyingly of water dripping this woman's apartment is constantly dripping water constantly logically the place would probably fall apart with this many holes to sum up this complaint towards the end and for absolutely no reason the camera cuts to shots of water dripping in slow motion in reverse why i have no idea it has no relevance to anything and once again i'm betting it's because the director thought it looked cool br br 3 one of the main characters says he became a priest to explain away holes in science this doesn't make sense to me i would think that going to church would be enough but no he has to go through the entire rigamarole of becoming a priest i just don't buy it secondly there are lots of plot holes a few of which i will elaborate on below for starters when she first gets the stigmata the scene ends with her laying unconscious bleeding next she's in the hospital who called the ambulance another one is towards the end when the previously mentioned scientific priest character is talking to the spirit who is possessing the girl he says take me as your messenger not a word for word quote but you get the idea his response you have no faith only doubt so because of this he possesses an aetheist an aetheist has no faith far less then any scientific priest and then there's the fact that the object of this movie's conspiracy this lost gospel of st thomas i believe is available at local bookstores the characters are willing to kill to supress this document but you could walk down to a bookstore and buy it maybe this is supposed to take place in an alternate history where it isn't wide known but the movie never tries to tell us this or to even hint that this is an alternate happening of that document's uncovering br br in closing this movie is terrible to a spectacular degree it is my arch nemesis which i feel the need to insult every chance i get i loathe it final grade f
a must see i saw whipped at a press screening and it was hilarious we're talking nonstop laughs it makes something about mary seem like a meandering drama amanda peet screams star quality with her winning combination of beauty brains and serious acting ability peter cohen the director has made a cutting edge film that shows the raw inside of men's egos in the urban dating world for all of it's comedy whipped succeeds with it's intelligence which is so rare for a first time director especially with a romantic comedy he is a major talent judah domke brian van holt jonathan abrahams and zorie barber round out the cast with depth and very strong performances as the would be slick lady's men you've got to see these guys go to work and get caught in peet's web check out the trailer on whipped com it's worth the 3 minute download
best of the best 4 is better than 3 but just barely basically i say this because part 4 doesn't contradict parts 1 2 like 3 does ie their is no reference to tommy lee having siblings br br anyway i liked the russian plot line of the story and especially sven ole thorsen's bit part as boris aside from that though and a few fighting scenes the movie is nothing special the limited budget is also very noticeable especially in the airplane blow up scene br br also part 4 does not really have a moral or say anything like part 3 did there are a couple of more better known actors hudson thorsen in part 4 but alas nothing like the beginning of the series and even these characters have very small roles br br alas it seems best of the best is the rhee show and to be truthful he cannot carry a movie br br saw on tape rating 4
honestly who in god's name gave this movie an 8 1 rating i guess the people who actually made or starred in the movie were the ones who voted otherwise this movie sucks this movie is nothing more than an amateur or possibly student film i'm a movie fanatic and have seen terrible movies but there was literally nothing redeeming here the story and acting was the worst i've ever seen the props including the use of toy airsoft guns with terrible special effects where just as bad as everything else i'm all for bad language in movies but the f bomb was dropped about every third word and i think we might have a winner for the most use of the f bomb in any movie ever the movie also appears to have been filmed using cheap video cameras and not actual film i'd expect this to get awards for an amateur movie shown only on public access stations around the country but it doesn't belong on a dvd br br do not buy this movie do not rent this movie all i can say was that this was a terrible waste of a free movie rental coupon this is valuable time that you will never get back unfortunately for me that time is lost but it's not too late for you if you decide to rent this movie consider this my warning
nice pleasant and funny but not earth shattering it does a good job of showing the behind the scenes world of theater groups and the lives of the actors the three witches are great both on and off stage i would assume the movie works wonderfully lots of apparent inside jokes if one was involved in theater which i'm not
this is a sad film made for sad people i was sitting in theaters tearing my hair apart wanting to break the chairs in front of me as the movie spitted out one cringe inducing scenes after another and there were people roaring with laughter behind me which made me wonder what kind of films these people must be watching to actually enjoy this horse s t br br nikkhil advani has six stories with no plot and no interesting characters the screenplay is dull probably he was drunk when he was writing this film there is no strong hold on any of these stories nothing new nothing to hold the audience and filled with dialogs which you would have heard a million times before one of the stories is about this couple not being able to have sex because of series of disasters taking place every time they want to do it i mean seriously is this story really required its not funny not creative but only proves that advani has no sense of comedy another of the stories which was probably the only story i was interested in is based on a man's infidelity and that too ends in a lame age old sati savitri pati parmeshwar crap i have no idea what the salmaan priyanka plot was all about there was no issue in the plot for it to be a plot she can't take karan johar's film because she has to marry salmaan why can't she marry him and still take the film or does advani and priyanaka just want to prove the world that it is in fact true that female actors cant be successful if they are married or that they should not act in films once they are married with six actors in the film obviously advani cant produce the film all by himself so he makes full use of sponsors like the times group shamelessly promoting their filmfare magazines and also some jewelery brand which the women in the film absolutely seem to adore i come to imdb to give it the worst rating and i am shocked to see posts praising the film it just goes to show the sad state of bollywood and how star struck the fans are with fans like these movies like salaam e ishq will be continue to be made and worse probably be a hit
another comment about this film made it sound lousy given talking pictures were so new i think the script and acting were good davis was so young and fresh she had not yet found her own style that we had grown to expect yet it is great to see her this way still learning the craft br br so many clichés came from this film and it seems this film blazed some trails for the next 70 years my vote is see it and remember how young this type of film was keep and open mind and you maybe shocked at how troubled the characters were in this picture for being 1934 and how we view the early part of last century as uptight i love it and hope you make up your own mind about it not influenced by others negative and one note comments
this movie is a great example of how even some very funny jokes can go terribly wrong i really expected at least something from this movie after seeing the add which was funny as hell but the movie wasn't half as good br br the weird part is that the jokes are actually funny the spoofs of the smoking ban jo bole etc are genuinely good jokes but i don't know whom to blame this movie flop on br br the prime candidates may be 1 the hammers actors and hammeresses actresses and not even the funny kind 2 the director 3 the guy who cast the actors and or the director anyway if you are really really bored and i mean really see this movie or else get a copy of each and every ad or teaser of this movie and laugh your butt of because those will be far funnier than the film br br p s the only saving grace of this film is mahesh manjrekar and the funny chappu bhai
this is the second eytan fox film i have seen the fantastic actor lior ashkenazi who starred in walk on water has a minor role in this film also br br but the real stars are the young israelis who live together in a tiny apartment noam ohad knoller lulu daniela virtzer and yelli alon friedman and the palestinian that joins them off and on ashraf yousef 'joe' sweid there is sort of a friends sex in the city thing going on mostly gay and they all just want the war to end so they can go on with their lives in peace br br but that's the rub no matter how many posters you put up or how many raves for peace you have the war is not going to end many have tried over the years to bring the two sides to the table but they just want to keep it going for whatever reason there are many on the israeli side both there and here in the us who just want it all and will not consider peace there are many on the palestinian side who apparently would be out of a job should peace ever come it is in no one's interest to end this war and the children suffer br br this is always on your mind as you watch this funny and engaging film it won't go away you know something tragic is going to happen and of course it does with the feelings on both sides running strong and revenge as the motivator tragedy always happens and that is what makes this an adult version of friends sex in the city there is no superficiality it is real life and it was a beautiful thing to see
how do you spell washed up fat italian who can barely pull off a martial arts move without needing some heart medication in this movie we see steven seagal at his lowest level of accomplishment since his career started it has been a steady decline into pathetic over indulgent behavior that has scuttled his career in this movie it looks like most of his training consisted of ordering the fetuccini alfredo at his restaurant every day br br he is fat slow and very old looking in this movie hardly a martial arts action hero more like a laughing stock clown br br it's time for steven seagal to retire this movie is about 2 hours of reasons why br br plot fat italian guy with a big reputation on the force gets wind that a crime group may be playing around with a drug designed by the military to create the ultimate warrior response this pretense although pathetic and laughable gives opportunity for some over the top fight scenes that include blasting through walls like a comic book br br did i mention this movie totally sucks and steven seagal is a complete joke yeah i did
former private eye turned security guard ditches his latest droning job and is immediately offered a chance to return to his previous profession his assignment to tail a mysterious french woman newly arrived in california and apparently wanted by suit and tie racketeers unsuccessful attempt to update the film noir genre without enough sting or wit or involving plot dynamics in the screenplay director and co scenarist paul magwood who later claimed the picture was edited without his involvement doesn't give off the impression of having high regard for the '40s films his chandler was borne from his nostalgia is appropriately rumpled but also bitter tinged and somewhat indifferent the handling is curiously commendably low keyed and warren oates is well cast as this '70s variant on the 'private dick' archetype but the movie doesn't have any snap nice to see leslie caron and gloria grahame in the cast though neither has much to do and caron's hot and cold running character is exasperating throughout vivid cinematography by alan stensvold nice location shooting but it fails to come to any kind of a boil 1 2 from
i just bought the dvd and i must say after seeing brazil and fear an loathing in las vegas terry does it again as well of being a fan of the monty python movies terry gilliam's genius follows through in this sci fi thriller whom bruce willis plays a wonderful role as james cole and as well perhaps my favorite character brad pitt who played the insanity of jefferey goines a must have for sci fi fans or movie fan of any type really because it includes suspense drama action etc br br any way the plot in the future 1 of the world's population survives a disease intended to wipe out the human race which is unleashed in the past by the army of twelve monkeys james cole bruce willis is sent back to 1996 which is when the virus was unleashed to find out about the disease so scientists in his time can find a cure before i go further james cole lives in an underground society and the animals rule the world on the surface due to the disease that will kill the humans anyway when he is sent back in time he is actually sent back to 1990 where he is sent to a mental institution because of his tellings to people of the virus during his stay he meets jefferey goins brad pitt who is later mostly responsible for wiping out the human race he also meets his psychiatrist madelein stowe who eventually teams up with bruce to save the world as she sees that he is correct in his tellings he is sent back and forth from his time to the past and eventually sent to 1996 where he then questions his own sanity but later pulls through to reveal a suspenseful end quarter of the movie and later builds up to the somewhat shocking climax where he tries to stop the man carrying the virus not actually brad pitt and is instead shot by the police as the killer gets away
well what i can say about this movie is that it's great to see so many asian faces what i didn't like about the film was that it was full of stereotypes of what typical racial characters would do in their role the asian girl without confidence who has to play someone else to get ahead the white guy infatuated with asian culture and chooses to leave his white world behind for the land of yellow and the keeping it real black cab driver plus all the coke shanghai tang and dunkin donuts product placement was a bit too obvious the story plot itself was fun but pretty much how i thought the story would unravel then again when watching romantic comedies you can't expect much but then again i would have been wanted to just be surprised at least once the parents are the best part of the flick
i cant help it but i seem to like films that are meant to be scary and are just plain bad i have personally listed it in my own top 10 worst movies right under creatures of the abyss watch this film and have a laugh just don't expect to see any academy awards for acting more chance of understanding the film its self in all honesty though i have seen much worse than this plus some maniac cruising round the desert wiping the same people out that just died is that unbelievable that its got to be original i think its one of those love or hate movies you can make up your own mind yes its awful but it pulls it off somehow thats why i love it
zombi 3 has an interesting history in it's making firstly it is a sequel to fulci's hit zombi 2 with zombi 2 itself being of course a marketing ploy to trick people into thinking it was a sequel to george a romero's dawn of the dead aka zombi confusing enough basically none of the films have anything to do with one another but who cares when they make money i guess fulci himself starting to not care about the production about half way through zombi 3 when he decided to walk out bruno mattei was brought on board to help pad the film with additional scenes to lengthen the running time br br zombi 3's plot is your typical zombie fare scientists develop a serum on an island in the philippines terrorists steal it unleashing a plague and zombie run amok the scientists want to create an antidote while the military is set on mowing down everyone without prejudice there are also brief inserts of a radio dj preaching about how we treat the planet br br overall i actually liked this film i heard horrible things but i find the goofy dialogue quite enjoyable the film seems to be an attempt at raising awareness about pollution corrupted military man playing god etc i get the feeling this was at one point a serious film but it veered off in a weird direction presumably when mattei came on board br br besides ripping off other zombie flicks this was very reminiscent of romero's the crazies you hear the radio dj breaking the good news with when you see the men in white suits gas masks run to them for help this is of course played to the images of the men in white gunning down zombies later they straight up steal a scene from crazies in which one of the regular uncontaminated people is killed by mistake br br the gore factor is pretty good in this one with zombie hordes around every corner how is it cool let me count the ways1 zombie birth 2 flying zombie head 3 zombie birds 4 zombie with no legs swimming in a pool my favorite zombie was the machete wielding maniac at the gas station he was bad ass and nearly tore down the entire building trying to kill a girl br br favorite quote  when a sergeant insists on cremating a zombie the scientists asks don't you think that once the ash is in the air it will fall to the ground and contaminate everything to which the sargeant boldly replies now you're talking science fiction he also continues to mention the science fiction told by the scientists even at the end when everyone dies br br extras gallery trailers and interviews most notably the one with mattei where he insists he directed 40 of the scenes yet cannot recall which ones or any other significant details br br bottom line a must see for zombie and fulci fans br br rating 7 10 br br molly celaschi www horroryearbook com myspace com horroryearbook
this movie sucked they took something from my childhood and raped it in an outhouse this movie was so bad i wanted to go home and hold my dukes dvds and cry in a corner the cast was terrible it wasn't the dukes it was stiffler and jackass driving a car when was boss hogg evil when was rosco a tough guy they never were boss hogg was greedy and rosco was an idiot when did jesse smoke pot he never did now don't get me wrong i'm very liberal and there's nothing wrong with a little chiba but it had no place in this movie the only thing good about this movie was the trailers before the movie and the end credits it was a waste of money time and air avoid at all costs
as with most rosalind russell movies this one is very entertaining it's fun all the way through it's definitely one of the last of this genre of film just good wholesome entertainment give it a try i don't think you will be disappointed
this is one of my favorite family movies loved it when i was little and it still holds up with me now that i'm older i still laugh at all the same old jokes and might even shed a tear a times i never have much cared for animals talking or at least un animated ones but this one i'll stand up for it's a pretty old movie but it will always hold a place in my heart br br there aren't any other live animal movies that i can think of at the moment that i even could compare with let alone like as much as this one i might be giving too much praise to this movie but i don't think show i really holds that great message that home is where the heart is or at least that's the message i gained from it definitely recommended for a good old family movie night
i don't have much to add to my summary this film ranks right up the there with top gun as one of the funniest films ever made while not trying to be i for one don't think it should be taken seriously when watched as it is very enjoyable br br i don't think it brings christopher walken's reputation down either as his reputation was on the wane back then anyway it took pulp fiction to wake him from the slumber he had been in as for michael ironside he has been in some of the great funny while not trying to be serious films total recall top gun what i think is amazing is the budget this movie had the scenes and actors and explosions etc are quite amazing so obviously someone liked it quite a lot and was willing to risk a lot of money whoever he or she was i like them because i love this film br br if anyone reads this looking for information on mcbain and i seriously doubt there'll be too many just know that it is a hilarious movie and should be viewed with a smile on your face
it was a bit bizarre and evil and i enjoyed it a lot the characters in the show were great as well and complimented one another well i was sorry to see it cut off i would have loved to see where it could have went you found yourself leaning toward lucas buck the sheriff who had more secrets than anyone lucas was frightening and alluring and i would have liked to have seen more of him and how his character became i will however buy the show just to enjoy it was great to something different on tv and paige turrco who was caleb's cousin she was a big mystery as to where and what she meant to lucas its a shame it isn't around still or was never finished i would have loved to see what would have happened
i watched this film in youth group where my otherwise intuitive youth leader and his wife squeed over it then some adult couple at a church related christmas party misled themselves into giving a copy of this movie to every single family in attendance and now my household is stuck with the film though it thankfully still remains in its shrinkwrap i cried bitter tears over these sad events and here's why first off this film has good intentions especially if you're a christian like me this movie is trying to show that you should put your faith in god and that it'll make your life better not so bad right eh it turns out a be a problem a big one this movie was made by a church so of course every single issue has to be dealt with as tastefully for christians as possible it is all black and white no gray areas god's grace and will in this movie is a predictable thing and it comes instantly to all those who do his bidding br br this is not the god i know this is not the christian life i am familiar with the god i believe in is a powerful and trustworthy god but he is not one that grants my every wish i follow him as best i can though the going is often hard yet the football team in this movie finds their humility and self control a lot easier than anyone should ever find it i cannot relate to cardboard cutouts who flip from bad side to good side in the course of a few structured movie scenes and when i do follow his commandments as laid out in the bible i certainly don't find myself showered in blessing as these characters do the largest of my immediate rewards is knowing that i have done the right thing everything else comes with long messy arduous work br br but take the example this movie sets grant taylor coaches the football team at shiloh christian school which has had 6 losing seasons in a row he may lose his job over it and he and his wife are low on money as it is they want a baby but the doctor tells him he is sterile oh and his car doesn't work and the boys on his football team are disrespectful to their parents whiny after their million losses and bad at kicking field goals this is sure one rundown community here br br but wait grant taylor decides he's going to trust in god for everything and he passes on his faith to his team so far so good not for long as they begin to obey blessing literally pour in on them suddenly the students stop disrespecting their parents the school has a big revival the team starts winning every game they even win the grand championship against the hardest team in the league coach taylor's job is reassured the school gets him a shiny new truck as a present which by the way is the epitome of shallow fair weather employers he gets a raise his wife get this even gets pregnant from his sterile sperm and that skinny kid manages to kick his first darn field goal right when it really matters wowzers woot yay praise the lord etcetera etcetera br br yipe just yipe nobody in my church has ever experienced christ in a such a cut and dry manner yes there have been miracles aplenty in my family as well as gifts and creature comforts and i attribute them to god's grace and lovingkindness but god isn't some faucet tap that you turn on and off by being good or bad he is by and large a mystery his gifts come unexpectedly often when you think you don't need them but you really do it's a long hard slog to the road of fulfillment and things never turn out the way you thought they would br br this movie has good intentions but because of its supreme shallowness and total escapism it tanks tremendously to a 1 10 the bad acting and sports movie clichés seem to be mere pimples next to the leprous falsehoods that this movie inadvertently pushes br br to all you future churches planning to make a movie don't be afraid to show real life even you have to add some inconvenient truths into the mix however much the baser populace is wowed by this cotton candy treat nobody has learned anything substantial from it give us the meat the bones the real stuff true life applies to everyone not just christians and that's one aspect facing the giants didn't manage to grasp
all the kids aged from 14 16 want to see this movie although you are only allowed at 18 they have heard it is a very scary movie and they feel so cool when they watched it i feel very sad kids can't see what a good movie is and what a bad movie is this was one of the worst movies i saw in months every scene you see in this movie is a copy from another movie and the end it's an open ending why because it is impossible to come up with a decent en for such a stupid story this movie is just made to make you scared and if you are a bit smart and know some about music you exactly know when you'll be scared br br when the movie was finished and i turned to my friend and told a bit to loud him that this was a total waste of money some stupid kid looked strange at me these day i could make an oscar with a home video of my goldfish if only i use the right marketing
this is one of the worst movies i have seen recently when a man says that he wishes he had a super power of being able to orally pleasure himself i pretty much consider the movie to be in the realm of childish 14 year old male fantasies the bed room scene was over the top and reduced an intimate moment into a farce of biological functions akin to passing gas in public from the first every other scene was a discussion about how little sex they where getting how long its been since they got some when their next sexual liaison will be and with whom it should be with on top of that the dialogue and acting was very poor and very forced not felt and they filled their lack of content with sleazy sex scenes this could have been really funny because the concept is actually interesting but it is poorly executed here please do not even think about taking anyone under 16 if you have to go and see it
i'm sorry i had high hopes for this movie unfortunately it was too long too thin and too weak to hold my attention when i realized the whole movie was indeed only about an older guy reliving his dream i felt cheated surely it could have been a device to bring us into something deeper something more meaningful br br so don't buy a large drink or you'll be running to the rest room my kids didn't enjoy it either ah well
this movie struck home for me being 29 i remember the '80's and my father working in a factory i figured if i worked hard too if i had pride and never gave up i too could have the american dream the house a few kids a car all to call my own i've noted however without a degree in something unlike my father that quit at ninth grade and a keen sense of greed and laziness you can't get anywhere br br i would like to know if anyone has this movie on dvd or vhs it's made for tv and i just saw it an hour ago ic an't find it anywhere i'd love to show this to my friends my pseudo friends family and other relatives see what they think and remind them that once upon a time americans would work for the sake of feeling honor and that we had pride in what we accomplished i think the feeling is still there but in a heavy downward spiral with so many things being made overseas
walter pidgeon is braley mason a civil attorney who takes on a criminal case in the unknown man a 1951 film also starring ann harding barry sullivan keefe braselle and richard anderson a great believer in justice pidgeon accepts a pro bono case defending a young man rudi walchek braselle accused of murder and gets him acquitted shortly afterward he realizes that the man is guilty and was extorting protection money from his victim as well as other shopkeepers in the neighborhood he is advised by the da sullivan that rudi is small change that to wipe out the organized crime one has to find the top man mason finds the top man and is faced with a dilemma br br the unknown man is a small black and white film that manages to hold the viewer's interest with its various plot twists though the plot is somewhat contrived it's really the story of a good man seeking his god justice and what he is willing to do in order to attain it and that's the most contrived part of all i suppose there was a time before o j the menendez brothers etc etc when people believed in justice and the integrity of attorneys for this viewer anyway those days are long over br br walter pidgeon does an excellent job his handsome elegant demeanor and declamatory voice show us a successful confident man but also a deeply caring one pidgeon had a magnificent career spanning 60 years but never really rose to superstardom he was a solid actor who could play just about anything and did it may be because by the time he was getting leads he was well into his thirties and missed being a matinée idol or it could be he lacked that certain something or that he was typed early on as second lead to a big female star like greer garson hard to say he gives an honest and touching performance here br br very good movie with good performances
alex d linz replaces macaulay culkin as the central figure in the third movie in the home alone empire four industrial spies acquire a missile guidance system computer chip and smuggle it through an airport inside a remote controlled toy car because of baggage confusion grouchy mrs hess marian seldes gets the car she gives it to her neighbor alex linz just before the spies turn up the spies rent a house in order to burglarize each house in the neighborhood until they locate the car home alone with the chicken pox alex calls 911 each time he spots a theft in progress but the spies always manage to elude the police while alex is accused of making prank calls the spies finally turn their attentions toward alex unaware that he has rigged devices to cleverly booby trap his entire house home alone 3 wasn't horrible but probably shouldn't have been made you can't just replace macauley culkin joe pesci or daniel stern home alone 3 had some funny parts but i don't like when characters are changed in a movie series view at own risk
now i'm one to watch movies that got poor reviews and say hmm this isn't so bad i loved the cable guy and thought that my big fat independent movie was great keep in mind i really didn't start watching this with high hopes but i figured that maybe just maybe it would be bad in a kind of way i could laugh at it i was wrong at no point at all during my suffering through this film and i use that term sparingly was i even close to being mildly entertained to start shaq makes quentin tarantino look like marlon brando when it comes to acting i hate rap music but as far as i could tell an amish priest would probably make a better rapper than him the main character is simply annoying and not a character that it's easy to like quite frankly i would rather eat a greasy turd out of a harlequin fetus' bloody sores than watch this again
mind my friends and i saw the movie based off it's title alone it's cute though obvious in it's plot and direction you know where the movie is going within the first five minutes my main contention with the plot is that while it remains tolerably consistent they never explain a lot of the things behind the characters an alcoholic father overworked mother stressed out sister that's a bad family but aside from the occasional mention from the sister there's not any resolution i was also confused as to the scene with the bottles it seemed pretty random br br the writing is a secondary concern the kids weren't bad actors but their script left a lot to be desired unfortunately what could have been a cute niche movie was pushed aside for a single blah special effect lame scripting and a glaringly obvious plot
the actors did a really good job playing their roles particularly the mom however as the movie progressed i found i was watching it more for their acting and not because i cared in the least for the people and at times i felt irritated by the irresponsible and hands off approach to parenting displayed again and again the daughter is a 17 year old shallow skank whose main ambition in life is bedding famous men and becoming a dancing nyphette complete with lots of booty shaking the son is a guy with low self esteem that seems very desperate for a relationship and friends so much that he throws a drug party late in the film the husband and wife are both bored but rather than put energy into their stale relationship would rather seek out new partners though the wife picks poorly as the man she throws herself at happens to be gay oops i just felt that all the characters needed to grow up and had a hard time caring for such shallow jerks i think the author's attempt was to demonstrate the utter banality and hollowness of the capitalist system however given that these characters are not typical of the average western family it seems disingenuous
absence of a good plot absence of decent acting absence of good cinematography absence of decent looking special effects need i go on review may contain spoilers the actors appear to be reading their lines and not very well at that most of the actors were acting like they were in a second grade play the story appeared to have been written by one of the aforementioned second graders it's not really all that convoluted it's just so simple and dumb that a person thinks they must be missing something so they think it is convoluted nope it's not it's exactly as simple as you think it is i understood the film that's how i know that it stunk most of the film just had people sitting around talking reading their lines trying to look sinister the narrator was annoying the special effects were laughable i love low budget movies i also like carolyn munro tom savini jack scarry and michael berrymore just not in this movie you can tell they weren't getting paid or weren't getting paid much because neither their hearts nor their talents were in it i love tony todd however he was only adequate in this movie in fact tony todd's performance is the only reason i gave it 3 stars instead of 1 and tony was only in it for a whole two minutes seriously i would suggest to fast forward the dvd to the two minute tony todd segment if i had gone to the theater and paid more than a dollar to see this film i would have been p o 'd and demanded my money back hopefully the people who made this will do better next time
i confess emma in my opinion is the single greatest novel ever written it is as close to perfection as any mortal creation can be jane austen reaches the pinnacle of her art here br br unfortunately this is at best a palimpsest br br comparison to the gwyneth paltrow version is inevitable that version is far more faithful to the witty spirit of the book and far more enjoyable to watch br br there are some good elements here kate berkinsale having previously played flora poste in cold comfort farm clearly emma's smarter spiritual twin is a wonderful emma raymond coulthard makes an appropriately decorative frank churchill the production is handsome but the interiors are far too dark br br however there are several major problems the first is mark strong first of all he doesn't look right for mr knightley this is perhaps because he plays the role like a censorious victorian parson it's badly out of tune br br the second problem is one of length simply put the film is much too short to get the right kind of feel it would need to be twice as long br br finally and most significantly there is the quality of the adaptation austen is an adapter's dream all the dialogue is there already it only needs to be pruned down and arranged properly andrew davies seems to think otherwise first this is a rather gloomy film and the last thing emma should be is gloomy more significantly davies has seen fit to rewrite the ending as some sort of bucolic feast what planet or minor work of thomas hardy is this come from it is utterly out of the style and spirit of the novel and i believe that it is hugely presumptuous to try to make improvements upon perfection br br watch the paltrow version or watch kate in cold comfort farm

'i'm working for a sinister corporation doing industrial espionage in the future and i'm starting to get confused about who i really am sh t i've got a headache and things are going wobbly oh no here comes another near subliminal fast cut noisy montage of significant yet cryptic images ' br br i rented this movie because the few reviews out there have all been favourable why cypher is a cheap derivative dull movie set in a poorly realised bland futureworld with wooden leads and a laughable ending br br an eerie sense that something interesting might be about to happen keeps you watching a series of increasingly silly and unconvincing events before the film makers slap you in the face with an ending that combines the worst of bond with a duran duran video br br it's painfully obvious they have eked out the production using dr who style improvised special effects in order to include a few good if a little babylon 5 cgi set pieces this sub fight club sub philip k dick future noir thriller strives for a much broader scope than its modest budget will allow br br cool blue moodiness served up with po faced seriousness disappointingly dumb this is not intelligent sci fi this is the plot of a computer game
horrible acting bad story line cheesy makeup and this is just the tip of the iceberg i have never seen a worse movie in my life 5 minutes in i decided to fast forward to see if anything redeeming would happen it didn't aside from a nice breast shot the movie apparently was filmed in some furniture warehouse and the same warehouse was used for at least 90 of the sets you even see this same red chair in several different locations if you are going to make a film at least rent an office building and an apartment not some warehouse which will echo all your actor's dialog note to producers renting a small office space and an apartment for a month is much cheaper than an entire warehouse and both are quite a bit more versatile and believable if you spend your money to rent this people i hope you got it with a return guarantee you will be demanding your money back i only spent 2 99 to rent this tonight and i feel ripped off
this is one of the best comedy ever the writing of this parody of soap is brilliant and the cast well just look at the names of the cast and you'll understand why it is so great if you're a kevin kline fan he does as always an fantastic performance and robert downey jr is perfect if you don't laugh while seen this movie you don't have any sense of humor
antwone fisher tells of a young black u s navy enlisted man and product of childhood abuse and neglect luke whose hostility toward others gets him a stint with the base shrink washington leading to introspection self appraisal and a return to his roots pat sanitized and sentimental antwone fisher is a solid feel good flick about the reconciliation of past regrets and closure good old hollywood style entertainment family values entertainment with just a hint of corn b
i went into this film thinking it would be a crappy b rated movie i came out surprised and very amused eva was good but lake bell stole the show she had amazing comedic timing the jokes in this film were surprisingly original and really funny with one or two flat jokes in between the plot was enough to tie it all together a woman eva dies on her wedding day and comes back to haunt the woman that is going out with her was to be husband its sounds far fetched but it actually works quite well br br 7 10 overall its a worthwhile cinema watch if not get it on dvd when it comes out
simple minded but good natured drive in movie about a simple minded but good natured high school graduate who has dreams of owning the coolest custom van in the world to use as his ballroom br br bobby our hero spends his entire savings to acquire the vehicle of his dreams joint sharing and love making quickly commence with girls bobby has picked up at the local pizza parlor but he finds out much responsibility danger and heartache come with being the owner of such a mechanical marvel br br the van is a guilty pleasure of mine it captures the laid back mid 70's mood and has enough unintentional humor to put it into the so bad it's good category
and in no way as clean logical and understandable as in pictured in that pathetic sum of tired hollywood cliches br br i'm 27 and i've spent 16 years of my life struggling through delusional phobia and paranoid hallucinations like the main character in the film i was successful mainly because of logic because i kept thinking over and over to keep delusion away from reality and to know what was really going on and what wasn't in the end i was really successful because of medication by the way but i certainly escaped madness because i knew before i took medication the difference between what was real and what wasn't br br so i feel entitled to tell you that this movie is a total fraud not only does it cheat with the main character's story who wasn't faithful to his wife who was bisexual something really important here but mostly it shows a comforting tamed view of schizophrenia which is entirely missing the point br br schizophrenia is a mind structure not a disease a schizophrenic isn't a normal man with a disease it's someone who from early on views and feels things differently from most people for him things like time space and people's personalities aren't solid things he feels it can be bent it can change it can mutate and maybe even disappear to cope with this a schizophrenic has a rich very imaginative inner world which normal people don't expect but he's trapped in it because he can't relate with most people and his world gets poorer and poorer until he finishes in a blank delusive dead end br br this is very different to what's depicted in this ridiculous cure tear jerking movie it should be violently frightening people other than the main character should appear strange weird and absurd like in lynch's eraserhead for example there should be really impressive weird gross hallucinations because that's what schizophrenia is all about it's not about details br br i mean watch naked lunch lost highway read p k dick's martian time split or ubik do watch the cell perfect blue dark city or play american mcgee's alice on pc and you may have a vague idea of what it's like don't watch the feel good movie of the month with banal situations cleaned characters and visuals and stupid plot tricks the cell is the most accurate movie about a schizophrenic's mind his visions and his inner consistency it's violent weird confusing and very very scary br br once again schizophrenia isn't about details it's not a neat tame trick played to you it jumps in your face and won't let you go walls fall apart people turn into strange hostile creatures you feel like you go backward in time you're not sure you're who you think you are everything feels strange unnatural believe me this is much much more than what's depicted in this soap like melodrama
what is this is it a comedy a horror movie or just nothing this is by far the worst movie i have ever seen especially the scene in romania when he becomes the werewolf that must be the worst scene that has ever been made this movie isn't funny it isn't scary and not entertaining at all please do yourself and me i don't think anyone should suffer through this movie a favour and don't watch this movie if you get is a present just throw it away and chop it in to pieces
if anybody really wants to understand hitler read wwi history not wwii history find out what happened during that war how soldiers had to live around dead corpses all the time how so many soldiers went insane from what they saw during wwi at the time they called it shellshocked now the call it post traumatic stress disorder if you learn the true horrors of wwi you will begin to understand hitler you will understand how a human being can become desensitized to death not because their evil but simply because it was the only way for them too cope with the horrors around them br br this movie unfortunately misses that as so many others do read some books on the subject and you should watch the movie paths of glory the only good wwi movie ever made you will see the frustration of the soldiers in that movie the sense of helplessness and a utter devaluation of human life as nothing more than bullet catchers br br thats what this movie misses its really the key point to understanding germany a lost war where millions and millions of germans lost their lives for no real reason then comes an utter economic collapse following the war those are the factors that create extremism br br the loss of family members and massive poverty will create always lead to extremism unfortunately this movie ignored these factors and has just become another throw away piece of crap to throw on the pile with really no real value there are fictional movie's based upon fictional characters that could give you a better idea of hitler than this does they just threw hitlers name on this so it would sell more
one of the most peculiar oft used romance movie plots is this one a seriously messed up man falls in love with a terminally ill woman who turns his life around before dying occasionally this story is done well and realistically as in the theory of flight an excellent weepie but more frequently it's done like it is here where as usual the heroine dies of old movie disease you know the terminal illness that has no symptoms but one fainting spell and a need to lie down as you're telling your lover goodbye forever and your looks aren't affected one bit and since this is the 70's neither is your sex life this is one of the worst versions made of that particular story where a very silly script puts two incompatible and unbelievable characters together and they're played by actors who are completely at sea br br this has got to be the worst performance of al pacino's career and i say that after having seen the devil's advocate only two days ago he plays a control freak emotionally constipated race car driver and plays an unlikeable character lifelessly he seems to constantly be asking himself why he's staying around the grating marthe keller so does the audience and spends most of the movie just standing there usually with his mouth hanging open the only time he shows any sign of life is towards the end where his character proves that he's changed from uptight to liberated by doing a hilariously bad mae west imitation hey it was the seventies br br marthe keller is equally terrible as the dying love interest her character was conceived as bold and free and touching and uninhibited and full of life even though dying and was probably meant to be played with an actress with the sensitivity of say vanessa redgrave or julie christie instead they got the expressionless face and heavy german accent of ms keller who comes across as more of a scary teutonic stereotype you vill eat ze omelet than anything like lovable she's supposed to be reforming pacino and filling him with courage and spirit and all that but it doesn't work that way it's more like she's harping on his faults in the most obnoxious possible fashion this makes for one of the least convincing romances in movie history where you can't believe she'd be with someone she finds so worthless and you can't believe he's with someone who gets on his nerves that much br br some bad movie fans call this a cult classic mostly because of pacino's silly liberating mae west imitation the scene is a scream especially in context but not worth sitting through the rest of the film for no only see the film if you're a serious bad movie aficionado who is especially interested in studying extreme lack of chemistry between leading actors or very bad casting not only are the leads terrible but pacino's other girlfriend is played by an actress who looks and sounds just likes keller with shorter hair i got them totally confused this isn't one of those laugh a minute bad movies like the conqueror it's just a really really bad movie br br
wow br br i just was given this film from a friend of mine who bought it for 1 98 at walmart and he felt that he got taken it is beyond boring most of the scenes are filmed in front of a green screen the acting is somewhat improvised almost as if they didn't have a script the martians are cgi which look like they were done by a novice or a fan produced movie i cannot stress just how bad this dvd really is br br example in one of the scenes the martians are torturing a local female captive she goes from a woman in front of a green screen to a cgi copy of that woman the change is totally noticeable and when she is killed you can see that it is a computer figure looking like something from a game back in 1990 br br if at all possible avoid this movie like the plague you can download two trailers from their site and see how god awful it really is
we've all been there sitting with some friends watching a bad movie laughing at how terribly it was made and how poor the acting was eventually the credits roll and everyone looks around and says how is it possible such a movie was made who paid money to have this script made into a feature film well jigsaw is not that kind of film instead of asking how this garbage was budgeted you wonder why the makers were shot out of a cannon into the sun yes jigsaw is quite possibly the worst movie ever made or conceived this coming from a guy who has seen campfire stories and fever lake the film starts out in some kind of college class what kind of class i am unsure but it is imagined to be an art class now these dorks have been given a final project by their idiot teacher five of them are given pieces of a mannequin and told to design it in any way they see fit and since there are only five pieces the other students in the class receive and automatic a oddly enough there are only six students in this entire class so the one goth chic gets a free a good for her a week passes and the five students plus teacher plus one hillbilly husband meet in a bar to discuss their and complete their project they put the pieces together head arms legs and inform the others why they chose their specifics designs now these creative geniuses used the week to their full advantage one puts a saw blade in the left hand the other gets a sawed off shotgun the right leg gets a bunch of broken ceramic glued to it and the left some magazine clippings the head is the worst getting a camera in the eye ala hellraiser 3 with some bottle rockets for a stylish mo hawk after they have all spilled their guts about their specifics designs the now drunk teacher says they are to burn the mannequin now aptly named jigsaw now up to this point it has been standard horrible movie fair bad acting dialog and everything else but has still been pretty plausible yet after jigsaw catches fire things take a turn for the worst jigsaw comes alive how you ask i have no idea he just does because the writers couldn't think of a realistic way for two pounds worth of molded plastic to become alive come on guys a bolt of lighting a traveling voodoo priest anything could have worked so once jigsaw comes to life he uses his new abilities of walking very slow and stilted with the use of his molded fingers to wreak havoc first he kills the cool guy with some barb wire this guy who was about to get it on with a hot chic decides drinking ground beer off in the distance is more important than what is in front of him with him gone jigsaw shoots the sexy girl in the face and then gives an old man a heart attack with a slight twist of his head he then saws up a nasty looking southern woman and then her hillbilly husband jigsaw then kills the nerdy guy with some headless deception did i mention jigsaw was taking body parts off his victims to make a human version of himself no well its not important they don't even show his macabre creation they don't even show him steal away a torso from his poor creators maybe he was trying to create the head detective from in living color so after these five have been killed the teacher and the nerdy girl are all who is left the teacher figures out that jigsaw only needs a head to finish his masterpiece since he is still uninterested in that torso thing so being the coward he is the teacher ties up the girl as a sacrifice to jigsaw who comes in only to go for the teacher with his electric buzz saw which isn't even plugged in that is where the freaking movie ends we don't even get to see the teacher get killed or what happens to the girl let alone an explanation why jigsaw came to life or how he cleaned himself off after being burned this movie is so shameful it has too be seen it is only 71 minutes so it is a small part of your day for the memories of a lifetime jigsaw jigsaw jigsaw thank you total recall the judge has ruled watch jigsaw only if your plans of severing off your genitals seems played out
this film is notable for three reasons br br first apparently capitalizing on the success of the two 'superman' serials this low budget feature was made and released to theaters marking george reeves' and phyllis coates' initial appearances as clark kent superman and lois lane part of the opening is re used in the series outside the town of silby a six mile deep oil well penetrates the 'hollow earth' allowing the 'mole men' to come to the surface forget about the other holes those in the plot br br second unlike most sf invasion films of the fifties the hero plays a dominant and controlling force in preaching and enforcing tolerance and acceptance of difference against a raging mob of segregationist vigilantes no 'mild mannered reporter' here clark kent knowledgeable and self assertive grabs control of the situation throughout i'll handle this even assisting in a hospital gown in the removal of a bullet from a mole man as superman he is gentler than clark towards the feisty lois but is also the voice of reason and tolerance as he rails against the vigilantes as nazi storm troopers br br third you will notice that the transition from the fleisher like cartoon animated flying of superman in the two serials to the 'live action' flying in the 'adventures of superman' had not yet been made

i read the book a long time back and don't specifically remember the plot but do remember that i enjoyed it since i'm home sick on the couch it seemed like a good idea and hey it is a lifetime movie br br the movie is populated with grade b actors and actresses br br the female cast is right out of desperate housewives i've never seen the show but there are lots of commercials for the show and i get the gist is there nothing original anymore sure but not on lifetime br br the male cast are all fairly effeminate looking and acting but the girls need to have husbands i suppose br br in one scene a female is struggling with a male for her life and what does she do kicks him in the testicles what else women love that but let me tell you girls something it's not as easy as it's always made to look br br it wasn't all bad i did get the chills a time or two so i have to credit someone with that
i had to walk out on this film fifteen minutes from the end having passed through the cringe stage and into pure boredom what really horrifies me i mean truly disturbs me is that there are people referring to this aimless drivel as 'delightful' or a 'must see ' i would feel deep pity for those so afflicted were it not for the distinct impression that most of the positive comments about this shallow and humourless travesty were written by industry plants br br the truth is this is a lame film that does nothing to entertain nor enlighten it is decidedly unfunny poorly scripted and has all the pace and energy of cold canned rice pudding to be kind to ms kramer the best one can say is it was a missed opportunity for having read the synopsis before i watched it i had expected something more challenging the possible misinterpretations of a close brother and sister co dependence the unexpected awakening of 'sisterly' sexuality and the comic potential in such sibling rivalry for the affections of the same girl were all obvious subjects for refreshing comedic exploration yet which at every turn the movie frustratingly shies away from br br instead the audience is subjected to a meandering series of uninspired and insipidly drawn situations with clichéd characterisations and dull performances from a cast struggling for belief and obviously in need of much tighter direction the lack of directorial control seems astounding on the one hand moynahan cavanagh and spacek all give very pedestrian performances while heather graham and molly shannon the latter in particular veer towards embarrassing over compensation at times one could lay the blame for this on the director maybe sue kramer hopes that if her actors over act they will force a bigger laugh from the audience but then again the cast is a veteran one one would expect them to do better br br sue kramer really needs to think carefully what kind of movies she wants to make and for whom given the possible issues gray matters alludes to and given her inability or unwillingness to fully explore them in the context of a comedy perhaps she should consider writing dramas instead i know it is never easy to make films about women and women's issues especially when one hopes to reach a wider audience than women alone but whatever direction she takes inconsequential and flimsy characters like gray are not going to cut mustard
written on the wind is a douglas sirk's melodrama douglas sirk was rediscovered by the cahiers du cinema fassbinder etc that hailed him as a master director i think that it is because of the sophistication of his cinematography written on the wind offers luscious color images and gorgeous decors but i ask myself is this enough to carry a film the acting in written on the wind ranges from weak to fair excepting robert stack he is convincing as the weak spoiled playboy lauren bacall normally a powerful presence in the screen is miscast in this film dorothy malone as the seductress the care free femme fatale is ok but she lacks the strength for the role rock hudson is efficient but vapid br br the plot has very interesting ingredients the main characters are br br a rigid patriarch br br his alcoholic son kyle robert stack never loved by the disappointed father br br his frustrated and nymphomaniac daughter marylee dorothy malone br br lucy lauren bacall a woman of principles formerly a secretary and now married to kyle br br mitch rock hudson brought up together with kyle and loved by the patriarch br br secrets beyond the door a love triangle frustration fistfights laughter death etc well when i read the story summary on the back cover of the dvd i thought that i was in for a treat my mistake why i'll try to explain written on the wind takes itself seriously and tries to tell a dramatic story as i said before the acting in general is not good enough the intensity is lacking there are many strong scenes in the story but the actors just do an efficient job i think that maybe with italian or spanish actors those scenes would have been explored fully they would end for us in an explosion of laughter or tears br br what remains to us is the beautiful cinematography of douglas sirk for me this is not enough if you want to enjoy a good melodrama see aventurera
i am a relative latecomer to the transcendent work of film auteur yasujiro ozu whose masterfully understated views of japanese life especially in the post wwii era illuminate universal truths having now seen several of his landmark films such as 1949's late spring and 1953's tokyo story i am convinced that ozu had a particularly idiosyncratic gift of conveying the range of feelings arising from intergenerational conflict through elliptical narratives and subtle imagery it is taiwanese director hou hsiao hsien's keen aspiration to pay homage to ozu on his centenary with this generally enervating 2003 film among with co screenwriter t'ien wen chu hsiao hsien appears to get the visuals right but does not capture the requisite emotional weight that would have made the glacial pacing tolerable br br the story concerns yôko a young japanese writer researching the life of mid 20th century taiwanese composer jiang wen ye in tokyo after coming back from taiwan where she taught japanese after 25 drawn out minutes of character set up she reveals to her father and stepmother that she is pregnant by one of her students in taiwan at the same time yôko's coffeehouse friend hajime who runs a used bookstore has an obsession for trains and seems likely to be in love with her hsiao hsien connects this slim plot line with a series of shots held for inordinately lengthy takes as the frame composition changes there are also long stretches of silence as well as an abundance of scenes featuring trains while these techniques are consistent with ozu's style hsiao hsien cannot seem to dive into the characters' psyches the way ozu did with maximal fluidity and minimal theatrics in particular yôko's plight seems rather non committal in the scheme of the drama presented and her parents' reaction overly passive to hold much interest in fact the whole film has an atmosphere of exhaustion about it which makes the film feel interminable br br the performances are unobtrusive though hardly memorable j pop music star yo hitoto brings a natural ease to yôko while tadanobu asano is something of a cipher as hajime the rest of the characters barely register even nenji kobayashi and kimiko yo as yôko's parents cinematographer lee ping bing provides expert work though he violates a cardinal rule of ozu films by not keeping the camera stable during shots hitoto speak sings the fetching pop song used over he ending credits hito shian the dvd includes an hour long french made documentary métro lumière which actually does help provide some of the context for hsiao hsien's approach to the film it includes excerpts from ozu's films in particular equinox flower to show the parallels with this film though surprisingly no mention of either tokyo story or early summer the obvious basis for some of the scenes and situation set ups there are also edited interview clips of hitoto asano and hsiao hsien as well as the film's trailer
i can't really say what i think about this movie its against the guidelines i've watched many many films and this has got to be the worst one yet extremely low budget i'm guessing all the money went into the slaughter house scenes cause i could of did a better job with a b w 8mm camera and a crew of monkeys it was so bad i registered just to leave a comment cause i had to tell someone movie rental place wasn't enough but this is my 2 cents worth i suggest borrowing it from some poor sap who rented it and watch it yourself cause i sure wouldn't waste the money on it myself again now i leave you with this comment i hope your not made at the rental place when they wont refund you your money
this is hardly a movie at all but rather a real vaudeville show filmed for the most part in proscenium and starring some of the greatest stage stars of the day singing in the bathtub is an absolutely amazing production number that must be seen be sure to wear your shower cap
spoiler this movie is about such a concept williams will go to any low in order to replay the football game that haunts his life russel plays the ex jock who peaked in high school finally the under dog get its shot and williams can save face instead of being the clown a great reverse tragedy 7 10
this inept adaptation of arguably one of martin amis's weaker novels fails to even draw comparisons with other druggy oeuvres such as requiem for a dream or anything penned by irvine walsh as it struggles to decide whether it is a slap stick cartoon or a hyper realistic hallucination br br boringly directed by william marsh in over saturated hues a group of public school drop outs converge in a mansion awaiting the appearance of three american friends for a weekend of decadent drug taking and that's it except for the ludicrous sub plot soon to be the main plot nonsense about an extremist cult group who express themselves with the violent killings of the world's elite figures be it political or pampered within the first reel you know exactly where this is going br br what is a talented actor like paul bettany doing in this tiresome badly written bore made prior to his rise to fame and jennifer connelly one can be assured that had he been offered this garbage now he'd have immediately changed agents avoid
muscular man ape in the jungles of africa is hunted by an opportunistic expedition team the comely daughter of the team's leader finds him first much ballyhooed version of the tarzan tale has an ok production but is crippled by the single handedly worst direction of a film i have ever seen john derek is bereft of inspiration beyond cheesy slow motion action shots and peek a boo glimpses of wife bo derek's unclothed body he has about as much talent behind the camera as ed wood trying for tongue in cheek sexuality the dereks lack finesse snappy timing and taste they have a sense of self parody and bravura abandonment they do throw caution to the winds but after a promising opening it all goes to hell miles o'keeffe who possibly had marbles in his mouth the entire time has the title role but plays third fiddle to john derek's ego and bo derek's sense of self importance from
the director and two stars of laura 1944 were reteamed for this solid policier dana andrews is the son of a criminal who becomes a cop to cut all ties with the past but cannot keep his inherited violent ways in check while interrogating suspects and one night he goes too far gene tierney is the estranged wife of his victim a decorated war hero who has become involved with the town's leading racketeer and andrews' no 1 nemesis gary merrill who had himself been the protégé of andrews snr as usual with preminger this is a well crafted movie with a notable opening credits sequence and enlivened by a good cast that also includes karl malden as andrews' incumbent superior tom tully as tierney's motor mouth taxi driver dad and neville brand as merrill's chief thug with notable support also coming from craig stevens as the slimy wife beating victim bert freed as andrews' sympathetic partner and robert f nolan as andrews' stern outgoing superior having already been warned by the latter to mend his ways or else andrews panics and impersonates stevens for a couple of hours following his murder to put the police on the in this case wrong tracks of merrill however after tully becomes the prime suspect by which time andrews and tierney are romantically involved the cop goes by himself in merrill's lair fully intending to get bumped off and 'frame' the racketeer for his own murder clearly the protagonist is a complex character and andrews rises to the challenge with a first rate characterization that is typically complemented by the in house fox noir style
the beautiful story of stardust is written by by neil gaiman writer of mirrormask and it's really a good story i think it would appeal to any labyrinth princess bride or 10th kingdom fan and yet it's totally unique and stands up on it's own and i feel the film adaptation of this story has a far better ending than what was presented in the original novel by neil gaiman i won't spoil it for you br br the main character tristan tristran in the novel is the son of a mortal and a faerie slave kept by a witch in the realm of faerie the story begins in a town near a wall that separates the magical world from the human world when there is a falling star tristan promises to retrieve it for a girl he is infatuated with he is unaware that the star has taken the form of a girl in the fairy world and that there are others after her too three elderly witches who want to use her heart to become young again and some bickering princes br br it's a really good story it has humor and magic and beautiful surreal scenes and visuals it's charming and i feel it can be watched by children and adults of all ages it's simply magical it's a true classic fairy tale the likes of which i haven't seen in cinema since the 1980s
this film was excellent i thought that the original one was quiet mediocre this one however got all the ingredients a factory 1970 hemi challenger with 4 speed transmission that really shows that mother mopar knew how to build the best muscle cars i was in chrysler heaven every time kowalski floored that big block hemi and he sure did that a lot
this movie is inspiring to anyone who is or has been in a tough jam whether financially or emotionally you will definitely laugh which is the best medicine left in a bad financial situation when her husband dies grace has to find a new way to make some money and it's not exactly legal which adds to the humour even my boyfriend liked it so don't think that it's a chick flic
i really wish i could give this a negative vote because i think i just wasted 83 minutes of my life watching the worst horror movie ever put to film the acting was just god awful i mean realllyyyy bad the dialog was worse the script sounded like it was written by i can't think of anything horrible enough to say and the day outside and the night inside shots make you think the events took over several days terribly acted directed written etc etc all the way down to the gofer how gets lunch for everyone stay away from this one at all costs if my only saving grace to stay out of hell is by doing one good deed it is to tell the world to not watch this crap this movie is the exact reason why horror movies are never taken seriously
heads hands and feet a band from the past just like strange fruit a triple whammy there those who have professed not to like this film are either heartless or under 40 and have had no experience of the real thing sad for them this is an achingly well observed little picture that is an excellent way of passing an hour or two and will probably not even fade much on the second showing stephen rae timothy spall as the fat drummer in many ways quite the most delightful figure of all and bill nighy a new name for me as the neurotic vocalist and front man all turn in super performances and juliet aubrey has lovely doe eyes to go with some sharp acting as karen who tries to hold the band together as they spectacularly self destruct br br the syd barrett brian wilson echoes are loud and clear mott the hoople rear up before one in all their inflated ridiculousness and the script is never mawkish for more than a minute don't compare this with spinal tap or the rutles or the full monty it's unfair on all of them the nearest comparison is the commitments and that's no bad thing and any film that can conjure up memories of blodwyn pig a band i do not remember ever seeing but the name lives on well it shows somebody in the team knew what they were on about br br a small delight and thanks for the memory br br oh and i've got another one stiff little fingers a a and what about steeleye span spooky tooth ten inch nails anyone you have to see the movie or have been on the road
bad actors bad filming choppy dialog shallow characters but then again it was a bad premise in the first place basically an 11 year old who is bullied because he has very little money is given a blank check by a moronic criminal of course the 11 year old happens to possess enough technology and intelligence to purchase a house cash a check for 1 000 000 dollars and even foil three bumbling idiots reminiscent of the three stooges br br preston blake is an annoying obnoxious boy who decides that when written a blank check by a complete stranger he will take advantage of the situation as best as he can in other words he wanders into a bank br br hands a teller a check he makes in his printer and miraculously walks out with a million bucks in cash preston is also apparently capable of reaching incredible speeds on his bicycle due to the fact that a man driving a jaguar after preston and his 10 speed could not catch him even when preston jumped a row of cars br br of course with every hokey adventure movie there has to be hot heroine in this case our hot heroine is a child molesting fbi agent who dates the eleven year old preston and promises another date when he turns 17 br br however the absolute worst aspect of this film was not its casting nor its sloppy dialog such as the only other way i could think of skinning a cat is to stick a hose up it's butt and then pick up the fur it was rather the entire fact that nobody in the entire film seemed to realize that the fbi does not give a damn about random people what i have failed to explain is that preston uses the alias macintosh to masquerade as an entrepreneur of sorts of course the fbi finds this intriguing and sends our young heroine after preston who uses his 11 year old wit to first scream when lobsters fall on his face then treat her to hamburgers finishing with a ridiculous romp through a cemented area where water jettison's from the ground our heroine fails to realize during this whole adventure that the criminal the fbi is pursuing is slipping and sliding right behind the two as they make their way to preston's limousine complete with a 1 dimensional driver who never fails to provide cheap 3rd rate laughs that the whole family can choke on br br overall 1 10 is incredibly gracious for this film i don't see how it only has a 4 4 10
in this muppet movie kermit miss piggy fozzie gonzo rowlf scooter camillia dr teeth floyd animal janice and zoot are college graduates who decide to bring their successful college musical manhattan melodies to broadway unfortunately no producer will even meet with the muppets after being denied by too many producers scooter suggests that the muppets decide to move on on their own however kermit still believes that he can get his show on broadway but after he finally does and let's everybody know that he sold the show kermit get's amnesia and the others don't know where he is br br this features many great scenes including a live action sequence that introduced the muppet babies a wedding sequence filled with muppets including the sesame street cast and traveling matt from fraggle rock scooter as a movie theatre usher and a scene where rizzo and the other rats cook breakfast br br my only complaint is that more characters weren't included more sure many of them appear at the wedding but there should have been some significant roles for bunsen beaker beauregard and sweetums and lips should have been part of the electric mayhem in this movie like he was in the muppet show's last season and the great muppet caper and miss piggys dog foo foo should have been with her as well after all rizzo the rat also performed by steve whitmire had a big part in this movie and he wasn't very well known at the time
dave devon sawa and his friends sam jason segel and jeff michael maronna have scammed their way through college when creepy ethan jason schwartzman discovers their secret he blackmails them into helping him score with beautiful good hearted student angela james king br br stupid and incompetent comedy a lot more groan inducing than laugh inducing movie tries appealing to its target audience with its disgusting gags but none of them work what's more it's full of worthless unappealing characters and schwartzman's character is so repulsive he's a major turn off movie even tries using 50's 60's sexpot actress mamie van doren in the movie's most outrageous scene yuck br br further bringing it down are its utter predictability and the waste yet again of veteran comedic actor joe flaherty's talent when's this guy going to stop accepting every role that comes along and do something worthwhile br br all in all the only thing i liked was james a k a jaime king who was very appealing and deserved better br br this gets no more than one out of ten from me
this movie is so misunderstood it is not even funny if you think of seeing this one for the shootings stay clear this one deals with the effects and trauma that the survivors must endure even the detectives are seeking the answer we all do why fantastic acting from the two leading ladies as we see how those we ignore are affected by the very same things we are affected with yes the language is harsh at times but it suits the characters well there are some loose ends left or unanswered but all movies have these the major issues are dealt with and this movie makes a major statement about how all of us adults feel after such major incidents highly recommended for teens and adults
what can i say about this film other than don't see it i waited and waited and waited for someting or anything to happen and it just didn't come watch amazingly as two people walk around while setting the record for most filler screen time in a single movie what are they doing are they solving a mystery are they gathering clues possibly it's just hard to tell at the end of the movie after a lot of radio signals are decoded illegibly on some sort of pet monitor and this guy gives some lectures the plot is finally revealed and tossed aside as quickly as possible some aliens want to get back to their home world utopia and are so happy there that they want to blow up the earth i guess they don't like sharing the wealth my guess is they finished filming and saw their 35 minute work or art garbage and decided that they'd let the editing crew turn it into an 88 minute feature film watch at your own peril it's not even funny because it's so bad it's just bad
this series it's something different sometimes european series are less accurate than the usa ones but this time authors have hit the right target creating a mix that works in a smoothly way edel starck is great it has all great plot smart witty always well delivered lines an amazing theatrical timing showed by all the stars and beautiful shots of berlin one of the most interesting city in the world it's entertaining to see how things works in the justice field in other countries than the usa and for once feel the old europe way of dealing with life kudos to all the cast and crew for a well done comedy that is going to be a must to see in the years to come watching the series in german is super
comes this heartwarming tale of hope hope that you'll never have to endure anything this awful again cough razzie award cough br br i disliked this movie because it was unfunny predictable and inane while watching i felt like i was in a psychology experiment to determine how low movie standards could get before people complained when i requested my money back at the end of the movie i was informed that because i watched the whole thing 'i wasn't entitled to reimbursement' i was told by the assistant manager that several people had complained and gotten refunds already though br br the movie summary is pretty basic the midget thief steals a diamond and the poses as a baby to elude police underneath this clever outline however lies a repertoire of original fresh and hilarious skits or not br br ask yourself the following do you like to see people getting hit by pans do you like fart jokes do you like to see midgets posing as babies threatened with a thermometer in the anus do you like tired racial jokes do you think babies say 'goo goo goo goo goo gaa gaa' do you drool br br if you answered 'yes' to any of the above then this movie is definitely for you although it has been billed in some places as 'the worst movie of the decade' there is probably a movie or 2 that are worse somewhere i can't say for sure i gave this movie 2 stars because we all know a review with only one star would indicate bias on the part of the reviewer and then the review wouldn't be taken seriously br br this lowbrow comedy is intended for a less intelligent audience and i cannot in good conscience recommend it to anyone save your money for something funny br br respect
ugh this is a terrible film full of disastrous comic relief no scares and scary leaps in story and plotline the only creepy thing here is the leading lady's hats lugosi was on his downhill slide and it shows i give this a 1 and this ain't no fun
i have seen miracles still happen now at least four times i never tire of this fantastic movie from the very beginning it holds a person's interest as the movie progresses and the plane crashes the story becomes very intense as we watch this young girl trying to survive alone and frightened in the amazon following a plane crash in which she was the only survivor losing her mother in this plane crash as well makes this movie even more dramatic as we see the perils this young girl had to endure during her ten days in the amazon to think this really did happen is just unreal and to think that anyone could actualy survive this is unspeakable as we see the wild animals snakes and other reptiles the enormous forests and wildlife as well as countless insects as the movie progresses we see the many dangers this girl has to face as she tries to follow the river in hopes of it leading her to a town remembering what her father told her about how a stream will always lead to a river and then into an even larger river and this means it will eventually lead to a community this young girl keep track of the tiny stream which eventually lead into a huge river all throughout the movie at times having to swim in dangerous waters alone frightened injured she always managed to keep going towards the end of this movie it was obvious she would not have been able to continue much longer as she had not eaten in ten days and only had water to drink and was very sick and tired from her perils eventually as she sees a canoe she realizes there has to be a village and men find her and they take care of her and then take her to a hospital where her father comes to see her after fearing she was dead along with the many other passengers such a dramatic movie and so heartwarming to see her father's face when he sees his daughter is actually still alive after all this time in the amazon movies like this aren't made much those days i will still see it again and i know i will never tire of it to think this girl was the only one single survivor of this airplane is just unspeakable also the fact she only maintained a few very slight injuries was even more remarkable whereas everyone else on this airplane perished in the horrific crash into the wilds of the amazon a brilliant movie superbly acted out indeed and one i will treasure forever and love to continue watching strongly recommended by me for sure
i wasn't terribly impressed with dante's 1st season offering in homecoming it wasn't much of a horror story but rather a smart political statement with the undead screwfly situation is the story of a virus unleashed on the world that causes men's sexual drive to replaced with murderous tendencies toward women the episode starts out all right with a short film explaining the way the screw fly was killed of by scientists then there is short scene where a man is arrested when females bodies are discovered in his home i assume this is supposed to show the beginning of the outbreak but is unclear because this is never revisited the episode go ons for a while introducing characters blah blah blah it seems cool and mysterious but the episode stars to get worse and worse as it lurches forward until its sad and unsatisfying end the worst episode well except for chocolate
this barely watchable film was a bit of an ordeal to sit through none of the segments are good but at least the first one was mildly amusing and the middle one was somewhat imaginative the final one was just plain brutal and after sitting through two weak comedic shorts the third one was truly painful to watch even by the low standards of a national lampoon movie this one seemed especially boring and joyless
i have just lost three hours of my life to this travesty and i can honestly say i feel violated i had read the reviews and heard the warnings and i thought i was prepared for anything at best i thought a faithful if misguided attempt at an original adaptation at worst a so good it's bad plan 9 for the new millennium so when i managed to pick up a copy in walmart while in florida and brought it back to the uk i joked to my friends prepare for the worst movie ever made oh cruel karma there is absolutely nothing to recommend this film the special effects look like the work of a first year design student using a spectrum zx81 the acting is terrible the accents are worse than terrible one artillery mans' accent seems to take us on a tour of the british isles from scotland to wales via northern ireland the dialogue is stilted the editing is non existent the production values prove that no expense has been gone to words really cannot describe how bad this movie is from the union flag flying from the horribly cgi'd thunderchild the royal navy flies the white ensign not the union flag to the woodworm ridden acting this is quite simply a crime against film making when you consider some of the literally zero budget fan films that are available on the 'net the star wars short troops for example the whole we're enthusiastic amateurs argument goes right out of the window and if you believe an interview with hines on the pendragon website this film had an 8 figure budget i can only assume that dodgy facial hair does not come cheap in the us maybe the problem is that hines co tried to make a film of the book rather than turn the book into a film if that makes any sense characters and extras spout chunks of text verbatim without trying to convey the feelings behind the words ironically enough the only person who even came close to giving a decent performance was darlene sellers the ex soft porn actress my advice pray like crazy that jeff wayne doesn't screw up and go watch the spielberg version it may not be true to the text of the book but i can say this as a lifelong hg wells fan and englishman as well speilbergs film is true to the spirit of the book maybe customs were wrong to let me carry this monster into the country but i will say this timothy hines stole three hours of my life and i want them back
this is absolutely the worst movie i've seen all year br br first i will say that the acting was very good and by all of the cast br br this was apparently meant to be very offbeat and in that regard it succeeded by the same token the story revolves around a self centered wannabe who is a clueless talentless chronic liar whose source of self confidence comes from a pair of leather slippers br br this was worse than watching a car wreck
contains spoiler with the possible exception of john wayne no other actor sat taller in the saddle in westerns than james stewart and this movie proves it this superb tale of revenge centered around a winchester rifle has only one weak spot i can think of the casting of will geer as a very unearp like wyatt earp the casting of the villains was good stephen mcnally as surly dutch henry dan duryea as waco johnny dean and john mcintire versatile at playing both good guys and bad guys as a slick gun runner the showdown between stewart and mcnally on the cliffs is great i'd stack this western against the whole crop of westerns made today they wouldn't stand a chance
i have no idea how imdb sorts reviews but i do know that as happens often on amazon com there are a striking number of very negative reviews for this movie which repeat the same somewhat obscure talking points almost verbatim a campaign only imdb knows br br as for this movie it's fine it's a funny cute and very straightforward movie br br it's been over a decade since i worked in brooklyn lived in queens and visited relatives in the south bronx but i found nothing inauthentic or exploitative about these kids is the grandmother a bizarre character yup do the dialogue and plot acknowledge this yes thankfully they do are other movies set in the les and featuring dominican puerto rican kids possible you betcha does that make this movie a crime  as some of the to my eyes astroturf comments would suggest hardly let a thousand plastic flowers bloom br br this is better than any episode of degrassi jr high or degrassi high scoff at the comparison but we've never had that and i'm touched to the core by this movie's humility of purpose and tender spirit br br that said i'd love to know the backstory behind all this backbiting d
so i'm at home flipping channels one night and i come across this man wearing heels and makeup standing in front of a colored background on hbo naturally i did a double take and decided i'd watch for a little while i didn't change the channel until he was finished it was so incredibly hilarious the next time it was on i made sure to tape it so i could watch it over and over again and it has remained one of my favorite things to watch during the first couple of minutes you can tell that the audience isn't quite sure what to think but he quickly wins them over with his incredible humor and wit while many stand up comedians mesh together in my brain eddie izzard stands out as one of the best his style is incredibly refreshing and it is nice to hear jokes about things like history and puberty when most comedians stick to current events his show stayed with me afterwards i went to italy over the summer and all i could think about while i was there was how italians are always on scooters going 'ciao ' 10 out of 10 see it you won't regret it
i watched the whole movie waiting and waiting for something to actually happen maybe it's my fault for expecting evil and horror instead of psychology is it a weird re telling of the oedipal myth i want to kill my father and mother and marry my uncle and compose musical theater with him i didn't understand why certain plot elements were even present why was the construction upstairs why was there that big stairwell with a perfect spot for someone to fall to their doom if no one was actually going to do so why have the scenes at all with the father at work why have such a nice kitchen if you're only going to eat takeout why would the boy want to be baptized and the parents be the ones to resist instead of the other way around i see lots of good reviews for this movie has my taste been corrupted by going up with 70s b movies and old sci fi flicks
what a waste this movie could have really been something decent but the writing in particular is crap and the main characters are rather shallow and uninteresting mike meyers was good and the historical recreation of late 70s decadence was well crafted but overall this movie was a big waste of time instead the movie to watch that deals with similar themes and the same basic time frame is the great boogie nights
this film should have been only 10 minutes i mean there is really only 10 minute worth of watchable content in this thing i even hesitate to call it a movie the opening credits of the film was somehow promising as the film begins by short comments of the man himself you really rub your hands and stay tuned for more footage from cohen's life well nick cave does a reasonable job covering one of cohen's famous songs the length of cave's performance makes you even more eager to see more of cohen whose wit and well spoken words have already tickled your fancy but as it turns out cave's performance is only the start of lengthy super boring performances by literally a bunch of no ones who don't even have a minimal attraction to keep you on your seat i mean what does the filmmaker really think five minute close up shots of wanna be singers in a fake concert in australia what does the filmmaker really think to insult the audience by adding fake applause to these endless nasty performances the film is a perfect torture that shows you very little of what you came to see there is not a single footage of cohen's past in fact except for a few photographs of his early days as a singer poet there is absolutely nothing if you add up all the minutes that cohen talks it may not even reach 10 minutes but these 10 minutes are tortuously presented bit by bit in between disastrous camera work that captures some of the most unattractive people screaming cohen's lyrics if you ever decided to waste your money on this film don't just throw it in the garbage and at least save your time
after reading the book which had a lot of meaning for me the movie didn't give me any of the feeling which the book conveyed this makes me wonder if kaufman even liked this book for he successfully made it into something else either that or he is simply bad most importantly where is the lightness from the very first scene music drownes out most of the dialogue and feeling and this continues right through the movie i think the makers thought that by having upbeat music playing right through the movie this would make the story feel light however they have completely failed here instead the music manages to give everything that 'movie feel' in a way dramatising events so that we linger on them so that everything actually feels heavy br br another example of the how this adaptation fails is by embellishing the story line making it more dramatic in the movie we see franz passing tomas on the street who is on his way to see sabina the introduction of this chance meeting passing which im sure didn't happen in the book gives tomas' story more significance than it does make it light br br there are many other examples where the continuity of the story has been changed imo for the worst however this might have been done because the book simply doesn't convert well into a movie such is kundera's style this makes we wonder if all the generous reviewers on this site were writing with their book and movie experience in mind rather than writing about just the film a film which is as long as it is uncompelling for those who haven't read the book yet i recommend just reading that for those who have i have to say you will just be wasting your time and probably end up here writing similar stay clear warnings
are you a giraffe ask john to nadia and she sure of responding well responds him yes in this way begin the communication between a man and a woman who don't know each other and at the same time the questions and doubts in birthday girl a film that i heard a lot of times but i don't dare to see until two hours of write this br br birthday girl is a passionate movie that makes me fall in count at the same time that nicole kidman is one of the best actress besides she is pretty and intelligent that i have ever seen birthday girl is the story of a lonely and routine man who looks for a wife at internet the woman that he finds comes from russia she seems to be that delicate woman normal not more one day in her birthday comes suddenly his cousin and his friend the man begin to discover certain things since here he don't going to be the lonely and routine man that always have been br br much of us going to think that this movie is just a regular one with a exploited plot much of us going to think that the action and thrills are sure and don't novel but birthday girl is just the opposite this movie is full of good surprises good performances and a imaginative plot that i had never seen and imagined this romantic thriller with certain funny touch is an excellent natural film with a lot of proposes for the films of it kind birthday girl have certain beauty and crudeness in its scenes but at the same time certain touching nature and makes it so deeper br br birthday girl is sometimes sad sometimes funny sometimes violent but at the end is totally satisfactory and i'm not sorry in say that this is a masterpiece br br sorry for the mistakes well if there any
i was always a big fan of this movie first of all have you seen the cast the acting is superb and help make this movie move along very well cybill shepherd was given great reviews for her role and they were well deserved the beginning of this movie starts in the past when corinne jeffries cybill whose picture perfect marriage comes to a shattering halt when her husband louie dies unexpectedly fortunately louse gets a second shot at life when he agrees to be recycled back to earth as the newborn alex finch robert downey jr alex goes on to live his new life forgetting his past life while corinne tries to get on with hers but fate crosses alexs path 23 years later when he meets corinne's daughter miranda mary stuart masterson and is suddenly flooded with a wealth of unwanted memories this is where the fun begins and embarrassing situations occur the music is great and the scenes are heart felt and very cute you wont be disappointed if you give it a chance chances are you'll like it very funny and sweet
i go to ucsb and take some classes with the executive producer alison anders she's a superb teacher and director so anything she put her name on i thought must be pretty good this film as a selection at the santa barbara film festival seemed like a good choice br br while this movie included some nice shots and cinematography the lack of story and coherence really took away from anything the it was attempting to accomplish my main problem was that this was someone's first film and you could obviously tell bad acting and an even worse screenplay stopped this film from getting off the ground the soundtrack had some nice music that gave a sense of the main characters struggle to cope with the sadness that lead to his leaving and now returning the place he grew up i just have to say that despite some of the better craft of the film it's lack of story and performance really prevented it from being some good
this is a feel good movie and nothing more and for that it is great fun to watch sure it skims over political issues but so what i am sure she wasn't trying to make 'good night and good luck' here let's not try to make it anything else but what it is light fare br br and very enjoyable at that br br do we remember what 1984 was like we've become very sophisticated according to the media as far as what we watch or not i tend to differ on this point goldie knew this was fun fluff and she went ahead and did it br br like her lightest fare protocol overboard housesitter wildcats private benjamin seems like old times foul play death becomes her first wives club and the remake of out of towners goldie knows what she is doing she plays every role for the camp that you can get out of it goldie just knows herself really well and she knows what she can do really well br br she has always made me laugh cheerfully and innocently i loved her in laugh in and every thing she's ever been in she has never tried to be anything else but who she is and that's that bubbling giggly girl next door who happens to be very pretty and has a smile and a laugh that will always endear me and remind me that life is pretty short and you've just got to lighten up because before you know it you are old wrinkled and suffering from one of life's inevitable ailments if it even comes that late br br i appreciate goldie for what she is a lovable comic actress
the vampire bat is set in the small german village of klineschloss where gustave schoen lionel belmore the burgermeister is holding a meeting with inspector karl brettschneider melvyn douglas from the local constabulary about all the recent murders six victims have been discovered in as many weeks all drained of blood bearing the same two puncture wounds on their necks brettschneider doesn't have a single clue but the superstitious elders of the village believe the deaths to be the work of a vampire brettschneider isn't convinced but the scared villagers keep telling tales of seeing a large bat meanwhile the latest victim martha mueller rita carlyle has been found brettschneider comes under increasing pressure to solve the murders but can he really believe that a giant vampire bat is responsible if it is how's he going to stop it br br directed by frank r strayer the vampire bat was a cheapie from majestic pictures to cash in on the success of it's two stars atwill wray their success in the previous years doctor x 1932 is more of a murder mystery rather than a horror as the exploitative enticing title may have lead you to believe quite frankly it's rather dull the script by edward t lowe jr takes itself rather seriously sets up the basic story that something is killing local villagers that something could possibly be a vampire then for most of it's duration the film focuses on brettschneider his incompetent investigations which are not to put too fine a point on it boring the vampire bat also has a bit of an identity crisis as it doesn't quite know what it wants to be the title would suggest a horror film while the majority of it could easily be described as a thriller with the final few minutes descending into silly sci fi there is no vampire bat the attempts to fool you are pathetic all the character's are broad stereotypes you can tell the villain of the piece straight away as a whole there is nothing particularly exciting or entertaining about the vampire bat i know it's old but that's not an excuse as cinema has moved on a lot since 1933 a bland flat dull boring misleading film such as the vampire bat just doesn't cut it these days just look at the original king kong 1933 released the same year how brilliantly that still holds up today i didn't like it i doubt many modern film goers would either it's as simple straight forward as that br br director strayer doesn't do anything special but this is a case in point where i can cut the film some slack because of it's age as a whole it's pretty much point shoot hope for the best stuff there isn't much in the way of atmosphere or scares although some of the sets which were already existing ones taken from the old dark house 1932 universal's european set on their back lot are nice add a certain ambiance to things br br technically the vampire bat can't compare to anything even remotely modern for the age of it it's alright i suppose but again i draw your attention back to the original king kong speaking of king kong it's star fay wray has a role in this as does horror icon lionel atwill i'll be kind say the acting is ok br br the vampire bat will i imagine fool a lot of people into thinking that it's a horror film about vampire bats when in fact it isn't personally i thought the whole thing was a bit of a bore it's short it tells it's story reasonably enough but i must admit i'm not a fan
i question its importance to queer cinema as it seems to be more about having a homosexual encounter via violent behavior than making any clear statements regarding homosexuality and violence br br three tales are tangled together in a rather sloppy manner i found myself trying to untangle the messy narrative in the first 15 minutes that alone didn't sit well with me weak plot points were endlessly repeated as though we might not have gotten it the first 10 times br br there was a feeling of padded dialog throughout the film more like a 45 minute boy's brief short rather than a fleshed out full length film it had a certain erotic flair male nudity and sex appeal but overall the sum did not equal its parts br br the 1st part boxer stalker storyline was the strongest and yet it too felt like it had been pulled thin bob has been following tim for four years and only now is he confronting him i felt as though their cat mouse game was not developed enough to merit its conclusion we needed more information about them and less parking lot locker scenes with tim relentlessly saying what do you want br br the 2nd part danny wants his buddy tony to beat him up while he jacks off tony doesn't seem to mind but he doesn't even appear interested in exploring the implications of his homo erotic hobby not even after they do it in the nude this tale lacks the all important transition from i'm a straight boy smacking my guy friend around for fun to i think i might be gay and hitting him because i'd like to spread his ass and do him s m style a very important thing to leave out br br clearly these stories each could have conveyed their points in half the time the 3rd part with the man and woman slapping each other around adds to that thought furthermore it was unnecessary and added nothing to the film yes the actors did a fine job under the circumstances and the four male leads were very sexy the make up bruises and cuts however was on par with a grammar school talent show br br there wasn't enough meat to this story to have any impact on the gay politic the film made no statement squandered time and is not engaging or worthy enough for thoughtful investment its fatal flaw is its amateurish approach that makes it ultimately impossible to take seriously
charles mcdougall's resume includes directing episodes on 'sex and the city' 'desperate housewives' queer as folk' 'big love' 'the office' etc so he comes with all the credentials to make the tv film version of meg wolitzer's novel surrender dorothy a success and for the most part he manages to keep this potentially sappy story about sudden death of a loved one and than manner in which the people in her life react afloat br br sara alexa davalos a beautiful unmarried young woman is accompanying her best friends gay playwright adam tom everett scott adam's current squeeze shawn chris pine and married couple maddy lauren german and peter josh hopkins with their infant son to a house in the hamptons for a summer vacation the group seems jolly until a trip to the local ice creamery by adam and sara results in an auto accident which kills sara meanwhile sara's mother natalie swedlow diane keaton who has an active social life but intrusively calls here daughter constantly with the mutual greeting 'surrender dorothy' is playing it up elsewhere when she receives the phone call that sara is dead she immediately comes to the hamptons where her overbearing personality and grief create friction among sara's friends slowly but surely natalie uncovers secrets about each of them thriving on talking about sara as though doing so would bring her to life natalie's thirst for truth at any cost results in major changes among the group and it is only through the binding love of the departed sara that they all eventually come together br br diane keaton is at her best in these roles that walk the thread between drama and comedy and her presence holds the story together the screenplay has its moments for good lines but it also has a lot of filler that becomes a bit heavy and morose making the actors obviously uncomfortable with the lines they are given yes this story has been told many times the impact of sudden death on the lives of those whose privacy is altered by disclosures but the film moves along with a cast pace and has enough genuine entertainment to make it worth watching grady harp
oh those sneaky italians it's not the first time they based a movie on source material without the permission or knowledge of the in this case author of the novel of course this is not something that is typically italian but got done quite a lot in the early days of cinema mostly because they often thought they would be able to get away with it james m cain's publishers managed to keep this movie off american screens until 1976 but nevertheless the movie itself has grown a bit into a well known classic br br the movie is not as great to watch as the 1946 american version but it's a great movie nevertheless this of course not in the least is due to the movie it's great strong story that is an intriguing one and provides the movie with some great characters and realism it follows the novel quite closely and is therefore mostly the same as other movie versions of its story with of course as a difference that it got set in an italian environment br br leave it up to the italians to make a movie about life and the real people in it these early drama's always have a very realistic feeling over it and are therefore also quite involving to watch unfortunately the movie lost some of its power toward the end when the movie started to feel a bit overlong and dragging in parts the movie could had easily ended 15 minutes earlier br br nevertheless i don't really have much else negative to say about this movie it's simply a greatly made one based on some equally great and strong source material quite an impressive directorial debut for luchino visconti who continued to direct some many more great and memorable italian dramatic movies br br 8 10
the film released at the start of 2000 alongwith mela both disasters so sad to start a millennium with such nonsense br br the film seems to suit 70's but looks like an unintentional comedy for 2000 br br anywayz some classic gems from the film paresh rawal i don't understand to laugh at his role or cry reason he goes searching his mother in the village worst part is when he realises a secret of anil he keeps the secret in his stomach which becomes big and makes him look pregnant i remember in my childhood my teacher told me the same joke urrf as a child i laughed at it that time but here br br the whole film is a joke can't explain we have anil in a dual role one older and younger and rekha playing the older's wife and raveena the youngers we also have reject harish while shakti playing the son of aruna irani who both fight on who has the worst wig br br direction is outdated music is bad br br anil tries hard looks too old in the younger role and too young in the older role yet good effort rekha is adequate raveena too is okay harish is bad shakti kapoor is terrible aruna irani is as usual rajnikant is okay in a cameo
i expect the same excitement as i spit on your grave but i was let down by just junk how can you even call this a movie its kinda of a mini porno it made my sick when the guy was made to eat his own business there is no story line to it at all it jumps to quickly from each murder if you like seeing a women naked or even mens parts then there's spots in the movie for and there's even a masturbation spot in the movie which makes it a porno and not a movie at all i have seen some dumb movies in my time but this is number 1 i want be watching it again at all the actors even look bored during the movie to me so they probably were in need of money badly to make this movie
jean luc godard's marxist polemic is as close to unwatchable a film as you're likely to see from an internationally respected filmmaker bits of political theater mind numbingly boring and interminable are interspersed with the making of sympathy for the devil featuring the rolling stones in the studio br br the process of the song's development from mick jagger playing a demo on acoustic guitar to the backing vocals being recorded towards the end is fascinating and it's worth renting this film just to see the bits with the stones almost half the movie is devoted to this so thanks to the miracle of chapter stops you can skip all the bizarre political skits and just watch the stones put a song together br br when i had this on laserdisc i valiantly attempted to watch it all but i don't see how anyone could get through it i finally gave up and just chapter skipped my way to the stones segments

david mamet wrote the screenplay and made his directorial debut with house of games ' a character study fraught with psychological overtones in which a psychiatrist is lured into the dark world of the confidence game margaret ford lindsay crouse has a successful practice and has written a best selling novel 'driven ' still she is somewhat discontented with her own personal life there's an emptiness she can neither define nor resolve and it primes her vulnerability when a patient billy hahn steven goldstein confides to her during a session that he owes big money to some gamblers and that they're going to kill him if he doesn't pay she decides to intervene on his behalf this takes her to the house of games ' a seedy little dive where she meets mike joe mantegna a charismatic con man who wastes no time before enticing her into his world instead of the twenty five large' that billy claimed he owed mike shows her his book and it turns out to be eight hundred dollars and mike agrees to wipe the slate clean if she'll agree to do him one simple favor which involves a card game he has going on in the back room in the middle of a big hand mike is going to leave the room for a few minutes while he is gone her job is to watch for the tell' of one of the other players by this time not only margaret but the audience as well is hooked the dialogue and mamet's unique style and the precise cadence with which his actors deliver their lines is mesmerizing as mike leads margaret through his compelling surreal realm of existence and introduces her to the intricacies of the con game we are swept right along with her from that first memorable encounter when he demonstrates what a tell' is and how it works to the lessons of the short con ' to the stunning climax of this film mamet keeps the con going with an urgency that is relentless and nothing is what it seems in the end margaret learns some hard lessons about life and human nature and about herself she changes and whether or not it's for the better is open to speculation mantegna is absolutely riveting in this film he lends every nuance possible to a complex character who must be able to lead you willingly into the shadows and does crouse also turns in an outstanding performance here you feel the rigid up tight turmoil roiling beneath that calm self assured exterior and when her experiences with mike induce the change in her she makes you feel how deeply it has penetrated she makes you believe that she is capable of what she does and makes you understand it as well the dynamic supporting cast includes mike nussbaum joey lilia skala dr littauer j t walsh the businessman ricky jay george and william h macy sergeant moran house of games' is the quintessential mamet he's written and directed a number of high caliber plays and films since and will no doubt grace us with more in the future but this film will be the one that defines him and you can go to the dictionary and look it up you'll find it under perfection ' this is one great movie you do not want to miss i rate this one 10 10
the point of the vastly extended preparatory phase of this star is born story seems to be to make ultimate success all the more sublime summer phoenix is very effective as an inarticulate young woman imprisoned within herself but never convincing as the stage actress of growing fame who both overcomes and profits from this detachment even in the lengthy scenes of esther's acting lessons we never see her carry out the teacher's instructions after suffering through esther's largely self inflicted pain in excruciating detail we are given no persuasive sense of her triumph br br the obsessive presence of the heroine's pain seems to be meant as a guarantee of aesthetic transcendence yet the causes of this pain poverty quasi autism judaism sexual betrayal never come together in a coherent whole a 163 minute film with a simple plot should be able to knit up its loose ends esther kahn is still not ready to go before an audience
i think its pretty safe to say that this is the worst film ever made when i saw the trailer on tv i knew right from second 1 that this would be a piece of and it would be best to avoid it but i somehow got dragged into seeing this by some friends i walked into the cinema with low expectations but i was hoping there would be a couple of cheap laughs to keep me awake during this film the so called jokes in this film bring a cringe to the face they are mostly comprised of people taking hits to the face and balls the baby looking weird and acting like a horny gangsta and the typical race jokes we see so often in todays garbage comedies the film is obvious and the story is not only impossible to believe but also predictable and dull the characters are extremely annoying and heavily stereotyped i never want to have to see this film again i'd rather take a bullet to the foot than be exposed to this piece of fuckwood ever again if anyone i see says they liked it i will physically punch them in the face
i was p ed when i couldn't see this one when it was screening at the philly film fest last year so when i saw that it was going to be on cable tonight i put it on remind as soon as i could so was it worth the wait well let's backtrack a tad as i have yet to give you the plot sean crawley is a young man who doesn't know what his path in life is enter duke george wendt who introduces him to his boss ray danny baldwin one night ray totally hammered asks sean to off the guy that they had sean following around and it goes on from there which leads me back to the question posed was it worth the wait yes and no the buildup was pretty good and george wendt stole the movie for me he just took the ball and ran with it but it's nowhere near as violent as i was led to believe and somewhere along the movies running time the ball is not only dropped but fumbled and taken in the other direction i know where this point happened exactly but can't say without spoiling the film but needless to say it happened the ending doesn't save the film either poor stuart gordon nothing can be good like re animator or castle freak br br my grade c br br where i saw it showtime extreme br br eye candy kari wuhrer shows her ta tas in one fantasy and then in the next more ta tas and it pans down and oh my god my eyes my eyes
this is the first time i have commented on a film because i felt that if the right person read it they might wake up and do something about it over the last few months abc family began airing a new format of movies i have seen the last three and enjoyed them they were engaging and did the trick my wife likes these films i was looking forward to viewing see jane date the trailers looked and sounded great unfortunately this is one film where the book must be light years ahead of the effort displayed by the writers and music people involved with this project the year is 2003 the source all bad the score was as interesting as an elevator ride in a department store it was intrusive and did not add any emotional content to the film at all it worked against it i work in the business of film and television i enjoy being entertained this is one instance where i kept thinking could it get any worse the script had lines from another decade and i know these women can act but you wouldn't know it from this movie to add to the overall experience the end left me shaking my head an advice to the executives at disney abc abc family and the producers under any circumstances please do not hire the composer or music supervisor to do any of your future films they have lost their touch and they need to understand what the word contemporary present day and current means when describing a romantic comedy there is a world passing you by all in all a huge disappointment from folks at von zerneck sertner and abc family
although properly warned i actually sat down to watch this movie in part because i usually give every movie an even break and because i thought that a single movie couldn't be that bad i stand corrected not even george kennedy barry bostwick or ben stein could save this turkey from sinking like a ton of bricks only once during this humor forsaken travesty of a spoof did i laugh namely during the simon says scene the other jokes are either poorly carried out or simply plain unfunny and some of them you actually see coming a mile away this movie just hasn't got what it takes to be a good parody like airplane i ii naked gun i ii iii or scary movie they all had a funny gags b good dialog and most important of all c unforgettable quotes men in white has got d none of the above to call this movie bad would be a gross understatement avoid this movie anyway you can consider yourselves warned
this movie is a gem because it moves with soft but firm resolution br br i caution viewers that although it is billed as a corporate spy thriller and ms liu is there it moves at a deftly purposeful yet sedate pace it's not about explosions car chases or flying bullets you must be patient and instead note the details here it's sedate because that's what the main character is the viewer has to watch him and think as this story unfolds br br i will not give spoilers because that destroys the point of watching the plot is what you've read from the other postings an average white collar guy seeking change and adventure signs on for a corporate spy job just go somewhere and secretly record and transmit inside data br br take it from there br br this movie starts at a surreal walk with a background tang of corporate disillusionment that entwines itself with quintessential underlying suburban paranoia br br then it begins to accelerate br br the acting on all parts is superb and yes some of the acts are caricature characters but they all fit and they entertain and the light piano rhyme in the background is just perfect as the soft soft key sinister theme all is not right at the beginning br br and at the end all is not what it seems br br get comfortable and turn the lights down to watch this one and turn up the sound this movie wants you to listen
rich ditzy joan winfield a woefully miscast bette davis is engaged to be married to stupid egotistical allen brice jack carson looking lost her father eugene palette is determined to stop the marriage and has her kidnapped by pilot steve collins james cagney seriously they crash land in the desert and hate each other but sigh start falling in love br br this seems to be getting a high rating from reviewers here only because cagney and davis are in it they were both brilliant actors but they were known for dramas not comedy and this movie shows why the script is just horrible there's not one genuine laugh in the entire movie the running joke in this has cagney and davis falling rump first in a cactus this is done three times only their considerable talents save them from being completely humiliated as it is they both do their best with the lousy material cagney tries his best with his lines and davis screeches every line full force but it doesn't work carson has this what the hell look on his face throughout the entire movie probably because his characters emotions change in seconds only palette with his distinctive voice and over the top readings manges to elicit a few smiles but all in all this was dull and laughless a real chore to sit through this gets two stars only for cagney and davis' acting and some beautiful cinematography but really it's not worth seeing cagney and davis hated this film in later years and you can see why
1928 is in many ways a lost year in motion pictures just as some of the finest films of the silent era were being made in every genre sound was coming in and while reaping great profits at the box office was setting the art of film making back about five years as the film industry struggled with the new technology br br show people is one of the great silent era comedies the film shows that william haines had comic skills beyond his usual formula of the obnoxious overconfident guy who turns everyone against him learns his lesson and then redeems himself by winning the football game the polo game etc this movie is also exhibit a for illustrating that marion davies was no susan alexander kane she had excellent comic instincts and timing this film starts out as the beverly hillbillies like adventure of peggy pepper marion davies and her father general marmaduke oldfish pepper fresh from the old south general pepper has decided that he will let some lucky movie studio executive hire his daughter as an actress while at the studio commissary the peppers run into billy boone william haines a slapstick comedian he gets peggy an acting job she's unhappy when she finds out it is slapstick but she perseveres eventually she is discovered by a large studio and she and billy part ways as she begins to take on dramatic roles soon the new found fame goes to her head and she is about to lose her public and gain a royal title when she decides to marry her new leading man whom she doesn't really love unless fate somehow intervenes br br one of the things mgm frequently does in its late silent era films and in its early sound era films is feature shots of how film making was done at mgm circa 1930 this film is one of those as we get charlie chaplin trying to get peggy's autograph an abundance of cameos of mgm players during that era including director king vidor himself and even a cameo of marion davies as peggy seeing marion davies as marion davies arriving at work on the lot peggy grimaces and mentions that she doesn't care for her truly a delight from start to finish this is a silent that is definitely worth your while this is one of the films that i also recommend you use to introduce people to the art of silent cinema as it is very accessible
this movie is a true masterpiece it really is it's rare you come across such a heartwarming flick full of fun laughter heartbreak and with a little drama to keep you on your toes br br a true family film homeward bound tells the story of three brave pets who set out to cross the rocky mountains in an attempt to find their owners following the changes they go through and the obstacles they encounter along the way one of the truly stunning things about this movie is its ability to give animals human personalities the voice acting is that good shadow is a wonderful character old wise and brave and watching him trying to save sassy in the river was a very powerfully moving moment chance who wouldn't love a dog like chance he's got to be the most mischievous and lovable pup ever shown on the big screen and sassy is very witty for a cat she had me in stitches when she was mocking the keeper 'here kitty kitty kitty not on your life chubby ' br br there were also lots of well made emotional scenes such as sassy going over the waterfall i was truly scared for her shadow falling in the ditch almost in tears and then the fantastic ending when all three pets return home including good old shadow br br a favourite for all time anyone who doesn't like this film must just not like animals rent it or buy it now and it'll leave you with happy memories that'll last a lifetime
really bad shot on video film made by not one not two but three amateur video makers br br if you're going to make a bad horror film at least throw in some blood gore and nudity there is some blood provided by latex cut off arm props bought at a halloween store there are lesbians and hookers but no nudity or sex the lesbians spend a lot of time in bed but only talking br br there seems to be no editing effects fades wipes etc once in a while a bit of black appears to separate scenes br br terrible music by bad heavy metal bands whose websites take up the majority of the end credits the werewolves are represented by rubber masks that are attached to just the actors face they didn't even bother to apply brown makeup to their necks arms or wrists br br i guarantee a 10 year old with a video camera could put together a better movie no reason at all to buy rent or watch this film except as an example of how not to make a low budget video
okay i've always been a fan of batman i loved the animated series and even batman beyond i even read a batman comic now and then so as can be imagined i was a little excited when i heard about this series and then i was severely disappointed this series is nothing it doesn't even begin to compare with the original series it's like one long toy commercial no depth whatsoever and what the heck was with the joker who in my most humble opinion is the best batman villain of all time and they killed him i wish i could say his design was the worst part actually i wish i could say there was anything about this series that was remotely creative or interesting in short because believe me i could say so much more do not waste your time on this show or your money
this could have been a rather entertaining film but instead it ranks with other duds like leeches and rest in pieces at the bottom of the cinematic food chain had they played this flick tongue in cheek it could have been a very entertaining film like re animator or dead alive but juan piquor simon plays it tongue in cheek in spots but straight more often br br the premise of this film is a small community that is besieged by mutated slugs there is an abandoned toxic waste dump near a sewer line that mutates the slugs into aggressive meat eating monsters albeit monsters that move slowly and can be squished under your boot health inspector michael garfiled and two accomplices are the only people that seem willing to fight the slugs while the sheriff and mayor think they are crazy the climax is a laugh riot unintentional at that which makes you scratch your head as to how stupid actors and screenwriter the scenario of destroying the slugs is br br story no new ground charted here simon seems to play the gore elements tongue in cheek but the dialogue is straight had simon worked with a clever script one with plenty of one liners and eccentric characters this could have been a cult film br br violence you won't be letdown here we get plenty of exploding chest cavity scenes as well as a grand head explosion in the middle of a fine italian restaurant the blood and guts that many horror film watchers enjoy is in full swing here you also get corpses of people who have been picked clean by the slugs and plenty of slug smashing scenes br br acting wow michael garfield seems to know that this script is a stinker and he delivers his lines with a facial expression that suggests he knows how preposterous this film making endeavor is kim terry as his wife does an adequate job even though she does little beyond the hold your face while you scream bit the teenagers were all horrible actors no exceptions man this film could have used bruce dern or jeffrey combs br br nudity two teens get naughty in bed before they get dispatched in a poorly done scene by a horde of slugs that crawled into the girl's bedroom both male and female nudity here
now this is one of big's best jack hulbert's single role in 1931 split into two for the band waggon radio team askey murdoch it boasts a great stalwart cast who ham the play up for all they're worth especially askey of course histrionics were provided by linden travers melodramatics by herbert lomas and pragmatics by richard murdoch br br the group of rail passengers stranded at the lonely country station for the night find more than they bargained for ghostly trains spectral porters hairy sausage rolls and arthur trying to entertain them all his repartee with everyone falls between side splitting and ghastly dull when the formula works it's very good but it sometimes gets very contrived and forced making the film seem more dated than it is but those damn treacherous fifth columnists thank any god britain hasn't got any nowadays br br ultimately a nice harmless film to welcome back to the tv screen as an old friend but if you were expecting to be shivered out of your timbers you'll probably be very disappointed
huge exhaustive and passionate summary of american cinema as seen through the eyes of martin scorcese needless to say there is never a dull moment in all of its 4 hour running time many genres periods and directors are all examined discussed more from the perspective of cinephile rather than contemporary director for anyone even remotely interested in american films or cinema in general a masterpiece and the best of the bfi's century of cinema series br br
i'm still trying to figure out if there was a point to this film br br for content that's supposed to be so 'rebellious' and 'controversial' the things that maddox distributes to the students are awfully lame students seem to be easily swayed by vague anti authoritarian sentiments and snippets of words illegibly scrawled onto leaflets rebel everybody br br i suppose it would have been too much to ask to have a teenage rebellion film where a school fire alarm doesn't get set off br br apparently a 'huge fight up on the football fields' is a fight that consists of two people br br characters personalities seem to wildly vary at random a football jock who maddox was fighting and who subsequently got a staple on the face is all smiles and apologies the next day br br the fact that it doesn't come to any real conclusion of the plot makes me feel that the whole thing could have been fitted into a half hour after school special if they had cut most of the attempted pseudo glitch soundtrack
the only thing that surprises me more than the number of people who liked this movie is that it was directed by clint eastwood whose work i admire immensely the leads had absolutely no chemistry not for a second could i believe that there was anything deeper than lust between them the story just didn't ring true add to that stilted conversation tons of stereotypes and an incredibly slow plot that basically leads nowhere and you've got yourself a real stinker kay lenz's nude scenes might be worthwhile for those seeking some salacious fare but otherwise this is a colossal waste of time my thoughts as i watched the movie was that itwould have been better titled cheesy
this movie has some of the most awesome cars i've ever seen in a movie and definitely the hottest women but i would have to say it is still one of the worst movies i've ever seen br br here is the plot and if you read it with a little inflection you have the acting as well br br beginning bring in characters hot woman singing obvious lip sync music agent or producer comes in thinks that she is awesome asks her to race she turns down too many bad memories flash to war hero back from war has several fights and becomes movie hero with attitude that he is better than everyone drive off in fast exotic car brother races then dies hero to avenge death cut away to getting weapons from friend you have never seen this friend before or after but seems to really care about him are you sure you want to do this yes i mean are you really sure yes give me weapons are you really sure yes ok i guess i can't talk you out of it be careful man i love you br br now he goes to blow up his uncles house who owned the car his brother drove finds woman decides to rescue her she drives off and he doesn't finish killing his uncle now there will be a race to finish the movie oh yeah need to throw in one more scene with bad people coming in to beat up people that don't really matter but maybe it adds a little plot race is not even that exciting of course it ends with two cars racing and one that should win throws in a surprise ending br br ok i just saved you 7 00 you can send all of your money to me because i should have given you the same amount of enjoyment as this movie does don't get me wrong the cars are awesome and nadija is beautiful but it is truly an awful movie
a cry in the dark br br a cry in the dark was a film that i anticipated would offer a phenomenal performance from meryl streep and a solid if unremarkable film this assumption came from the fact that aside from streep's best actress nomination the movie received little attention from major awards groups br br little did i anticipate that a cry in the dark would be such a riveting drama well constructed on every level if you ask me this is an under appreciatted classic br br the film opens rather slowly letting the audience settle into the chamberlain's at a relaxed pace and really notice that at the core they are an incredibly loving simple family fred schepisi the director selects random moments to capture of a family on vacation that give a looming sense of the oncoming tragedy while also showing the attentive bliss with which lindy streep and michael sam neill chamberlain care for their children br br while the famous line a dingo took my baby has become somewhat of a punchline these days the movie never even comes close to laughable the actual death of azaria is horrifyingly captured it is subtle and realistic leaving the audience horrified and asking questions br br the majority of the film takes place in courtrooms and focuses on the chamberlain's continuous fight to prove their innocence to the press and the court which suspects lindy of murder br br the fact that it is clear to us from the beginning that they are innocent makes the tense trials all the more gripping as an audience member i was fully invested in the chamberlain's plight and was genuinely angered and hurt and saddened when they were made to look so terrible by the media but at the same the media public opinion is understandable i loved the way the media was by no means made to be sympathetic but they always had valid reasons to hold their views br br the final line of the film is very profound and captures perfectly the central element that makes this film so much different from other courtroom dramas br br in terms of performances the only ones that really matter in this film are those of streep and neill and they deliver in every way for me this ranks as one of if not 1 meryl streep's best performances for all her mastery of different accents which of course are very impressive in their own right streep never loses the central heart and soul of her characters i find this to be one of streep's more subtle performances and she hits it out of the park and neill an actor who has never impressed me beyond being charismatic and appealing in jurassic park is a perfect counterpoint to streep's performance from what i've seen this is undoubtedly neill's finest work to date it's a shame he wasn't recognized by the academy with a leading actor nomination to match streep's b c the two of them play of each other brilliantly br br more emotionally gripping than most films and also incredibly suspenseful a cry in the dark far exceeded my expectations i highly recommend that people who only know of the movie as the flick where meryl screams the dingo took my baby watch the film and see just how much more there is to a cry in the dark then that one line br br a
as it is often the case the impressive and explosive trailers of asian films add up to nothing more than lackluster stories similar to unleashed which was great dog bite dog tells a story where men are raised as ferocious savage dogs that carry out their master's bidding the main characters an emotionally undeveloped amoral killer who is matched against an equally unstable police officer are far from the common heroes and villains we often see in fact by the end you lose track of who you're supposed to empathize with failing to feel even the slightest emotion for either of the men  whether that was the failure of the director or perhaps the underlining message he was trying to tell is up to you to decide br br although the beginning of the film was filled with intrigue and unpredictability by the half way point it slopped down to a humdrum story of survival and revenge the suspense which was evident at first soon disappeared because of a grossly mismatched music score which brought down the potentially effective story telling and in the end you were left feeling that all that detailed background information and introspection of the main characters was somehow very unnecessary br br on the plus side the transition in story from point a to point b was quite atypical compared to us movies  so those who aren't familiar with asian films and are tired of hollywood's predictability should check it out br br the white balance seemed off throughout most of the film it was like looking into a picture shot on fluorescent when it was supposed to be set on tungsten maybe i'm the only one but it strained my eyes br br the movie also enjoyed playing tricks on you  an interesting build up gave me hope for the slow moving story until it was diverted to a low budget low speed chase scene and just when you think you were going to get an unanswered indie ending with a mix of shakespearean tragedy you realize that it's not an ending at all but rather a transition into a wacky country music montage about peace and serenity br br throw in some grisly from behind choke scenes a moment of redemption unexpectedly brought back into savagery and back again the other way asians' fascination with bodily fluids and a horrible music score that didn't match the film and you get the average bland asian thriller br br i just don't get why every fight scene was overlaid with clips of roaring lions i thought they were supposed to symbolize dogs ultimately in the end we are reminded about a true killer that still lurks amongst us  tetanus br br 4 10
gunga din one of the greatest adventure stories ever told a story about the british foreign legion in 19th century india and a lowly water bearer named gunga din a local denizen who aspires to be just like his military counterparts three british sergeants whose loyalty and camaraderie for each other extend far beyond the bounds of mere patriotism their's is a true and abiding friendship for one another and each would be willing to sacrifice his own life for the good of the other gunga din longs to be a soldier too a bugler in particular but can never attain that rank due to his subordinate social standing however heroes are not made according to their social credentials they're made through their willingness to sacrifice for the greater good of others gunga din tries at every turn to prove his mettle but will he ever attain the rank he so passionately seeks you're a better man than i am gunga din one of hollywood's classics and a perfect 10
this is the last of four swashbucklers from france i've scheduled for viewing during this christmas season the others in order of viewing were the uninspired the black tulip 1964 from the same director as this one but not nearly as good the surprisingly effective lady oscar 1979 which had originated as a japanese manga and the splendid cartouche 1962 actually i had watched this one not too long ago on late night italian tv and recall not being especially bowled over by it so that i was genuinely surprised by how much i enjoyed it this time around also bearing in mind the baffling lack of enthusiasm shown towards the film here and elsewhere when it was first announced as an upcoming dvd release from criterion br br incidentally fanfan la tulipe has quite a bit in common with the afore mentioned cartouche not just cast and crew members producers georges dancigers and alexandre mnouchkine cinematographer christian matras actor noel roquevert but plot wise as well  in fact the hero is a womanizing soldier jean paul belmondo's cartouche had also had a brief military spell who's loved by a fiery girl in this case gypsy gina lollobrigida while he's himself obsessed by an impossible love here it's none other than the king's daughter as in the later film too fanfan an ideally cast gerard philipe who ironically is so full of life here that one finds it hard to believe that he would be stricken down by cancer within 7 years' time is flanked by two fun loving yet cowardly men one of them is actually his superior officer and the heroine's own father and opposed by an unscrupulous figure within his own ranks the ageing roquevert with whom the hero eventually engages in a rooftop duel since he too has amorous designs on the gypsy girl for the record lollobrigida will rejoin philippe in her next film rene clair's delightful romantic fantasy les belles de nuit 1952 br br fanfan proved to be a big box office hit on its home ground and even copped a surprising but well deserved best direction award at cannes over more renowned films like an american in paris 1951 detective story 1951 othello umberto d and viva zapata in fact its popularity ensured its re release in a computer colored version presumably for the benefit of viewers who wouldn't touch a black and white product with a ten foot pole and the criterion dvd itself contains a sample from this variant being obviously a foreign language title there's also the dubious choice of an english dubbed soundtrack but even if these proved not especially painful to sit through considering when all is said and done there's simply no substitute for the original br br fanfan la tulipe a nickname given the hero by a young genevieve page as the celebrated madame de pompadour contains about as much comedy as the expected action and romance while some may find this overwhelming i don't agree myself as i enjoyed the sharply satirical narration and on the whole this combination is comparable with jerzy skolimowski's equally droll the adventures of gerard 1970 that said the swordfights here are remarkably forceful for an essentially lighthearted enterprise particularly a scuffle in the woods and the ambush at a convent and the film itself rather adult at times with numerous allusions to sexuality as well as coarse language adopted throughout when viewed back to back with vintage hollywood fare as i did now the climax then is quite ingenious the enemy forces who amusingly are made to speak in speeded up gibberish are depleted by our heroic trio alone much to the king's amazement who as portrayed by marcel herrand  best known for his role of leader of the parisian underworld in marcel carne''s children of paradise 1945  is himself something of a lecher br br p s an italian tv channel has been threatening to screen christian jaque's promising champagne for savages 1964 for months now but despite programming it three times already with a tentative fourth one slated for next week they have yet to show it even so i do have three more films of his in my unwatched vhs pile equally culled from late night italian tv screenings the three hour epic la chartreuse de parme 1948 also starring gerard philippe the second twin 1967 and the legend of frenchie king 1971 with brigitte bardot and claudia cardinale
at times this overtakes the thing as my favourite horror film while carpenter's film is the more efficient and more entertaining flick kubrick's is more artistic more thought provoking and probably scarier it's one of the few films where i can look past its flaws and truly and wholly love it i try not to compare it to the book  which i've only read once a number of years ago and which scared me to death  because the two don't have a lot in common besides the story and characters obviously it's almost as if kubrick was banking on people's love of the novel in order to make his film more frightening and it that way it's certainly one of the most interesting book adaptations ever made as well as one of the greatest horror films br br what makes the film so terrifying is not the jump scares not the blood and gore not the various ghosts that pop up from time to time it's the destruction of jack torrence some people have complained about the casting of nicholson in this role saying that it's too obvious that he's going to go crazy in the film given his past roles and his appearance i disagree we know he's going to go crazy  since most of us have read the book  and jack's appearance only furthers this notion but it's the way he acts at the beginning that makes us truly scared he's calm quiet patient he engages in inane small talk with the hotel managers and even with his own family and with a wife and son as irritating as his it's a small wonder that he manages to do so but once he gets to the overlook he changes he becomes irritable angry on edge the scene that always shocks me is when wendy interrupts him typing and he utterly loses it telling her to leave him the f alone this is the first f bomb dropped in the film and it's a shock to the system from then on all bets are off br br another thing i love is the multiple interpretations present in the film we're never really sure if what we're seeing is actually happening many critics have noted that whenever jack talks to a ghost there's a mirror present showing that he may as well be talking to himself but what of the other characters wendy never sees anything until the film's climax until she is given a tour of the hotel's many ghostly inhabitants but she is well aware that something is wrong while danny connects with the place almost immediately his psychic powers are not in question  how else would hallorann know to come to the hotel  but does he ever see any of the ghosts that his parents witness it's easy to claim that jack merely loses it being trapped in a hotel with his family and wendy later does as well  seeing your husband attempt to kill you with an axe will do that  but what of danny it appears that his body is taken over by tony but how do we know for sure none of these characters are reliable witnesses hallorann probably would be and he warns of the dangers in 237 but he's killed as soon as he arrives at the overlook a scare kubrick achieves by playing on the assumptions of fans of the novel and that final shot has there ever been a more enigmatic ending in cinema has jack really been there before or was his body merely 'absorbed' into the hotel when talking about the acting in this film any discussion begins and ends with jack nicholson shelley duvall gives one of the most annoying performances in cinematic history  probably on purpose to give jack's character more of a reason to snap  and danny lloyd is no better but jack is a powerhouse part method part improvisation he's simultaneously terrifying and appealing for better or for worse he's the character with whom we identify with not the annoying kid or nagging wife we all want to have a hotel to ourselves for a season be able to do whatever we want who cares if it's haunted of course the technical aspects are terrific kubrick's long takes strange angles and bizarre imagery all contribute to the horror the use of colour mirrors long hallways and every other motif only heightens this and don't even get me started on that score i don't know if the film would be half as scary without that haunting electronic tune its strangeness perfectly reflects the hotel the mood and the entire film itself br br i know king doesn't like this film but king's input on cinema is nothing to brag about as great of a novel writer he may be his screenplays are terrible and his attempt at directing is better left unnoticed this is not a very faithful book adaptation but it doesn't need to be and it really shouldn't part of the horror of the film is that the viewer doesn't have the book to fall back on there's no reassuring source material kubrick masterfully alters the narrative to terrify the audience even more if only for that this is one of the most innovative films in any genre and it's got everything else on top of that
i felt this movie started out well the acting was spot on and i felt for all the characters situation even though the true family unit was not completely revealed we never got enough info on the father to truly feel his pain for his whole involvement or the build up for his animosity with tobe i mean in one scene you see him admiring her for tensity and in another scene he just about takes her head off another problem with the movie was it just unraveled and lost all focus by the end and i was begging for it to just be over with any movie with such a long drawn out and painful ending should never get an automatic rating of 7 or above just for the acting we are looking at the over all quality of the movie experience in the case of this movie the end is so bad i seriously contemplated just walking out of the theater this movie pulled me in then just spit me out
freddy's dead the final nightmare the sixth installment of the nightmare on elm street series and once again another bad sequel i think this is tied up with the last sequel of the dream child i was lucky enough to get the nightmare on elm street series box dvd set for my birthday so i got to see all the sequels may i say that i'm just getting more and more disappointed though with these sequels at least the past two it just seems like freddy lost his edge it's almost like the writers were trying to give freddy a soul and they're just destroying it instead of reinventing the story this was a sequel that wasn't needed sorry to robert englund but this was very much below what freddy krueger represents br br freddy is back but he's got something we don't know about a daughter maggie she's not aware that he is her father but soon she finds out what his dark secrets are and he wants her help she has to do her best to resist his powers but it's hard with all the good memories she has of her loving father ironic isn't it but freddy isn't giving up without manipulating her into his ways br br freddy's dead the final nightmare is also presented in 3 d radical huh note the sarcasm this is one of the worst sequels it's tied up with the fifth sequel of the nightmare on elm street series i'd rather watch the second nightmare on elm street to be honest this just had bad acting stupid editing and just over all a bad idea for a story i didn't like the concept of it and it just ruined the whole idea of who freddy krueger really is the death master of nightmares not father knows best br br 2 10
this movie was made by a bunch of white guys that went to school together well there's nothing wrong with that except it looks like it was made by a bunch of white guys that went to school together 90 percent of the cast are white males about same age it's almost like watching a bunch of guys at boys camp who turned the camera on themselves the movie has no plot it simply repeats the same action of blood bath after blood bath there are some funny scenes and comedic bits but they don't redeem the flat monotony br br the graphic cartoon scenes are used to cover the stuff that was obviously beyond their budget or resources to do and not done very well at that anything that can't be done with white guys running around on the beach covered in blood is done with cheap animation br br i went to see this film after seeing the trailer which makes it look like a tarrentino piece well the trailer scenes are as good as they ever get ther rest of it just repeats the same kind of mundane inane comedy it works at times but it gets boring after the same stuff comes at you over and over it's more like a string of satuday night live skits than a movie it's a hit you over the head with it kind of comedy i can see where the story idea is intriguing but in this film post apocalyptic america is much like medevil england in fact wheatlry says the story ideas came from that era he plans to make a part 2 i guess he thinks he's tarrentino or maybe doing a parody thing br br at the opening in la wheatley mentioned he will bring back pretty much the same cast in part 2 he was asked if he might consider a more diverse cast in the next one to which he replied well yea sure
where do they get the money to make films like this i mean there's nothing redeeming about this film none of the actors are known the writing is terrible the photography is blurry the story wanders between being a bad version of repo man and a nicklodeon western and the acting is unbelievable for someone who watches all kinds of film good and bad i must admit that this film is about the worst i've seen since attack of the eye people back in the 50's i don't really like to trash the effort of people trying to create some entertainment or heaven forbid art but this film would seem to appeal to no one the story bends on a mystical contamination of a person who's a bad version of the celtic soul eater although he functions more like a male succubus without the sexual overtones the bad guys have to team up with the good guys in a town where they are unable to escape from take it from there as that alas is the best part my advice is that unless you are into bad mythology amateurish writing unconvincing acting and tedious settings you will best be served by leaving this one on the shelf when you're out renting videos
this show is awesome i thought that the two episodes where paul died were so sad i actually cried but the other shows were awesome kerry was my favorite character because she was in the dark side i also thought that bridget was funny because she was all perky i also thought that guy who played kyle was really really cute i loved it when kerry made sarcastic remarks about everything the guy who played rory was cute and paul played by john ritter was really funny this whole entire tv show is funny and i wish they still showed it on tv when they did show it on tv though i watched it every single time it was on the next time it shows i will watch it over and over again
very bad film very very very bad film it's a rarity but it defenitly is not worth hunting down this italian jaws rip off makes little sense most of the time and no sense the rest the alligator is not at all convincing and many of the sub plots go nowhere if it's at the local video store you may want to watch it if you're a fan of monster movies but it's not worth hunting down
i was surprised when i saw this film i'd heard it was the best ever filmed of the novel how disappointed i was br br how any true jane austen fan can rate this adaptation is a mystery to my eyes the scriptwriters have decided to stick in bits of ridiculous humour which are embarrassing at the best of times but also ruin the feel of the period as for the cast gwyneth paltrow makes a rather shallow heroine but then any 'hot' american star would be questionable in the role toni collette is miscast and poor ewan mcgregor is made to look laughable br br i really could not say a good thing about this film i seem to be among the very few who don't rate it but if you want my advice see instead the tv production starring kate beckinsale believe me that is far preferable to this superficial trash
an axellent second installment that manages to be just as good as the first br br once again the casting is just wonderful i like how the first and second episode have nothing in common except for the wit and cleverness br br the second episode is just very funny very silly and very enjoyable it is the very first christmas episode about a woman who is tormented by a serial killer dressed as santa after having killed her own husband just like the first episode karma br br the most humorous scene is a tie between the murder of her husband and her phone call first faking her fear until it becomes real
an very good storyline good thrill to it but the 10 last seconds destroyed the whole movie what happened extremely well made and an good story destroyed in the last seconds sorry to say but a 1 in vote thats what it it deserve i would think that chris shadley could come up with a better end but maybe next time all this meaningless blood gore for nothing the end would lift the story to close to a 10 but it didn't the end destroyed the whole story i think most people aren't lame and when they goes a movie thy want a good end even if it is intricate but the only lame here is the end sorry
this should not have been listed as a colombo because in my opinion it does not resemble any of the other colombo ever made this should have been listed as a movie starring peter falk and not playing the caracter of colombo because it does not do justice at all to our great lieutenant colombo
the planning episodes were a bit dull but when they reached the desert it was quite fun to watch the reason why i call it the most realistic reality show is because much to my surprise charley fell out of the race relatively early when his hands were sore i expected the usual stress and then a miracle fix but instead he actually quit the race the most anxious moment of the show must've been when max was stuck out in the desert with almost no water or food the ending was great and i was very happy to see at least one of the team make it overall not as great as the long way round but definitely an interesting watch as one gets a peek into the most challenging race in the world
father and son communicate very little in fact they speak different languages but when the son drives his father 3000 miles for his pilgrimage's to mecca the conversations finally take place they are difficult and growth is necessary on both parts br br this movie takes us into the hearts of these two travelers and it is indeed a grand voyage for the audience as well as the two principals the imagery throughout is impressive especially the final scenes in mecca it underlines for me once again how much different the world can be but also at the same time how similar the same was true for the father and son in this film br br see this movie tell your friends to see it you'll be glad you did
spoilers br br i saw the original on tv sometime ago and remembered this production as less gripping than most beeb costume drama i rewatched on dvd this week and still have the same impression of it it's a good story at first but weakens when the heroine becomes oh so terribly brave and noble and returns to her utterly vile husband when he's ill and i got so totally irritated with her saintliness i suppose this was the right thing to do when the story was written as well as contributing plenty of angst and it was difficult for a woman to be independent of her husband as marriage made her no more than his possession let alone to carry on scandalously with a lover as i expect a lot of the modern audience would have liked to see but it's hard to take the santimoniousness nowadays and especially when this heroine had a strong brave admirer ready to defend her against anyone and everyone so re the story as in the film i'm equivocal it's well done as per the novel but somewhat irritating as per today's kind of life br br steadfast hero gilbert was certainly a saint to put up with his ladylove's variable and often cryptic behaviour and persistent self denial and to be so consistently supportive so i felt it a great shame that when helen was at long last free to be with him the script didn't allow him a bit more than about one minute to fall on each other for a quick hug before the titles came up this was completely ridiculous when we'd been waiting all this time through all that dripping sentiment over the undeserving husband for a decent bit of dialogue and a good embrace between hero and heroine instead the ending was as though the film makers had run out of time or finance or just couldn't be bothered here you are one minute do what you can in that then cut as the director wants to go home now i was left feeling totally dissasatisfied br br however very high commendations to the acting of toby stephens a perfect and very handsome hero and rupert graves a superbly nasty and self pitying villain tara fitzgerald was satisfactory within the confines of the script that forced her to be a depressing and rather sanctimonious victim so much of the time br br that said i love these classic dramas and virtually all of them are a sight better than much of the modern drama on tv these days so 7 stars because in spite of the irritations it's still a good watch
i saw this film at the toronto film festival where it received a standing ovation this film tells a story that to my knowledge has never been told before namely about the rosenstrasse a street in berlin uprising of german gentile women who were married to jews at the end of the second world war as such it is a unique story and what's more is the only film about the holocaust that i have ever seen that shows that there were good germans the helping family in anne frank for instance was dutch who did not support the nazis and in fact had the fortitude to stand up against their own country's immorality and brutality during the nazi regime at the risk of their very lives the acting is great across the board the framing story in new york interesting and intricate the direction from von trotta masterful in every scene and the production values including the gorgeous cinematography outstanding of course the family in new york could be speaking german many immigrants in this country choose to speak in their native tongue with their family a common occurrence so that criticism is unwarranted to say more would spoil the experience the film is long but i did not look at my watch once i am hoping this film gets some distribution is north america for not only is this film a masterpiece but it can actually help heal any animosity people have towards the germans because of their support of hitler if this film is playing in your area i urge you to see it you will be glad you did
perhaps you won't care for the social commentary or the film makers point of view i myself am mystified at the insignificance' angle kasdan seemed to promote  when clearly the actions taken in the movie promote certain significance the ending confused me however there's absolutely no denying the manner in which the story is presented the magnificent symbolism throughout the threaded character arcs visuals dialogue  is absolute masterwork i've watched the movie dozens of times and i still marvel at its perfection there's not a moment action cut or line that doesn't have everything to do with the theme realistic human performances from all the actors scene to scene it's woven fantastically br br i have a pretty level sap meter the buzzer never went off during this film if you're a thinker rather than a casual viewer  this movie delivers exponentially absolutely mesmerizing do you have to agree with the message to appreciate the display who cares if it made you warm and fuzzy or not was it interesting br br personally the movie affected me  significantly in my top 5 br br note the front page reviewer clearly speaks from a flawed african american perception what he may have failed to recognize is there was a hand  shake not a hand out the spiritually dead white man' simply saw a man to respect and admire and he did something about it the fact he was black had little if anything to do with it color is simply used to draw the parallel and the chasm it's no accident the opening sequence shifts from black and white to color either if you view the blacks in this movie as token'  you may want to reassess your angst you may be seeing only black and white yourself eh just a thought
alone in the dark is one bad movie and tied with deuce bigalow for worst movie of the year i wish that was all i had to say but of course the imdb stipulates a word count and all that br br i'm in two minds about what kind of bad movie is a worse kind of bad movie a low budget dreck like red zone cuba monster a go go and manos or a huge budget disgrace like gigli superbabies or this guff you see movies like monster a go go and manos happen because the director hasn't a clue movies like this happen because the director is a stupid money grabbing idiot who simply doesn't care about his audience br br it's more shocking when you consider that uwe boll the mastermind behind this shocking crap and already has some real garbage under his belt has created something that only happens once in a blue moon the really terribly bad horror film everything about it is a mess cheesy cgi bad plot insane random camera cuts and appalling soundtrack br br alone in the dark is a dreadful movie that should be watched by absolutely nobody woo hoo review over give me a bud roll on 2006 and may i never speak of this again br br don't watch this film
if you go see this movie you'll be holding a grudge against the movie theatre the director the producer the actors and the person that told you to go see it shame on you sarah michelle geller for putting your name and face to this poor excuse of a movie it may have been more scary if the japanese actors would have just spoken in japanese instead of attempting to 'act' in english i wanted to boo when the movie ended a true disappointment after all of the hype on tv and movie trailers promoting this lame money maker sarah michelle really didn't have to act at all to make this movie she just practiced her frowning skills don't waste your time or money on this film
pay no attention to the comments behind the curtain the majority of people leaving positive comments about this film must be receiving royalties this is a horrible film in every way imagine high school kids with no money and no sense of humor making a slasher comedy video they would receive a d for this college kids would receive an f or asked to leave the school since this monstrosity was made by professionals i believe there should be jail time or at least cinema probation i enjoy watching bad movies like plan 9 from outer space but this thing doesn't even fall into that category the script acting sound and directing are so bad that it is virtually unwatchable if you enjoy watching bad films that are amusing stick with ed wood blaxploitation or 1970's horror films after viewing this you get the feeling you've wasted an hour and a half of your life
this movie was a real torture fest to sit through its first mistake is treating nuclear power as so self evidently a 'bad thing' that it barely needs to convince the audience of it when it does stoop to putting in its argument it has the participants breathlessly deliver barely substantiated facts all that's missing is someone crying when is someone going to think of the children while watching this movie i kept thinking where'd you hear that or that can't possibly be true yet little of the info was backed up by any reliable sources and bless 'em the 'regular folks' in the movie came across more like luddites than people with any understanding of the pros and cons of nuclear power to be fair that might be the fault of the film makers but equally fairly it's a condition shared by the movie's rock stars br br as for the performers now some of these people are highly respected musicians whose music i've enjoyed and i'm sure a few of them really did believe in this cause but they all come across as wheezing old hippies desperately searching for something to get worked up over now that the 60s have passed them by particularly embarrassing are graham nash and james taylor nash seems to be trying too hard he looks like he can't possibly believe the things he's being told not that i blame him but desperate to feel noticed and included james taylor performs what has to be the wimpiest protest anthem ever stand and fight in the most sickeningly cheerful way you can imagine in fact most of the performances are pretty bland when they're not being patronizing nobody seems worked up by this event as if it really doesn't mean much to them at all it's worth noting that the driving force behind this whole event seems to be john hall of the band orleans and responsible for some of the wimpiest mor pop of the 70s remember if you dare dance with me and still the one it's worth noting because that's symbolic of how the cause here fails to inspire any real passion in the music the cause is supposedly life or death but everybody sleepwalks through their numbers like they're playing the catskills except maybe gil scott heron his protest number we almost lost detroit is on topic at least but delivered with all the smugness of a high schooler impressed with how 'controversial' he's being br br only bruce springsteen's performance raises a pulse i've never been a big fan of the boss but he absolutely smokes no question part of me thinks he was taped separately at another event and edited into this movie to give wake the audience compared to the general blandness and air of self satisfaction here it's no wonder bruce was hailed as the savior of rock'n'roll br br but even his performance is hobbled by the lifeless concert shooting i don't expect a lot of flashy camera movement from a '70s film but the shots are unnecessarily static broken up only by split second cutaways to a back up singer's tonsils now some of this may be because the performers are lifeless to start with and maybe the film makers are more skilled at shooting documentaries than concert footage but all you have to do is watch rust never sleeps or the last waltz to see a movie like this done with more skill and with more exciting musicians br br so really there's only two things to watch this movie for springsteen's stellar performance and as a sad snapshot about a counter culture in decline
wwe's last ppv of 2006 proved to be a hit with the fans but for one reason only the ladder match which was only scheduled to be paul london and brian kendrick against william regal and dave taylor but with the recent crap ppv being december to dismember wwe knew that it had to do something to get the fans talking again this proved useful when it introduced mnm and the hardy boyz to the mix and announced that the match was going to be a ladder match br br the match was brutal and one of the best ladder matches i have ever seen but joey mercury's face was a total mess johnny nitro didn't even check on his partner they just carried on like nothing happened and taylor and regal did nothing during the match except hit people with a few ladder shots in the end london and kendrick retained the titles br br elsewhere on the show kane defeated mvp in a decent inferno match when he set mvp's stupid costume on fire chris benoit downed chavo guerrero in a decent match gregory helms defeated jimmy wang yang to retain the wwe cruiserweight title in a solid effort br br but the main event was a total mess king booker teamed with finlay to take on john cena and batista the action was shoddy and no one cared who batista picked for his partner br br overall results kane defeated mvp in an inferno match br br paul london and brian kendrick retained the wwe tag team titles against the hardy boyz mnm and david taylor and william regal in a ladder match br br chris benoit defeated chavo guerrero to retain the us title in a decent match br br gregory helms defeated jimmy wang yang to retain the cruiserweight championship br br the boogeyman beat the miz in a terrible match br br the undertaker defeated mr kennedy in a last ride match br br john cena and batista defeated king booker and finlay in an abysmal match br br overall grade b
the original movie man from snowy river is one of the best i've seen nearly perfect a lady and the tramp storyline in two senses rich girl poor boy and ability vs bloodline the sequel however is not only a shameless attempt to capitalize on the good name of the original but also a ridiculous overblown disneyfied mess best summarized as rambo meets the black stallion without the charm of the black stallion the young hero comes back from a 3 year absence and suddenly he's superman on horseback in the original good film he was real and believable but sadly reduced to a caricature in the sequel i've hardly been as disappointed in a movie and at times this thing made me quite angry they missed hardly a cliché brazen audience manipulation do studio heads think that all you have to do with a horse loving audience is put pretty horses in front of them to make them happy a mess of a movie
at first i was weirded out that a tv show's main character could bring the dead back to life but then i thought i'd give it a shot guess what i love pushing daisies and look forward to wednesday nights just to watch it then for the next week i watch it a few more times on my dvr the colorful characters witty banter fast paced dialogue and new unique situations draws me in and captivates from beginning to end ned and chuck charles' relationship is interesting to watch as they work their romance around the fact that they cannot have physical contact even detective emerson cod's character has continued to grow in complexity and olive snook jiminy crispies she cracks me up the narrator's voice is fun to listen to and the cinematography gives me the impression that i am watching a movie instead of a tv show i have recommended my family and friends to turn on pushing daisies and they are hooked too the show is well worth waiting a week for a new episode and if you have not seen p d i highly recommend watching it
winter kills is a terrible incoherent and very disappointing conspiracy comedy thriller from little known director william richert while watching the film i honestly felt as if i was the emperor in the classic fable the emperor's new clothes the film made me feel like a fool because i couldn't make head nor tail of the serpentine plot and the nonsensical characters but i felt kind of embarrassed to admit to myself that the film was tying my brain up in knots so i stuck with it to the end hoping that the whole tangled mess would untangle itself then i realised the film is supposed to be serpentine nonsensical and illogical because that's the whole point this is a satirical look at conspiracy theories and theorists with the knotting up of the plot used as a metaphor for the knotting up of truths half truths and lies that define any conspiracy even when i got that the joke was on me i still felt winter kills to be a pretty awful movie br br young nick kegan jeff bridges is the younger brother of a former united states president who was assassinated in philadelphia nick is present when a dying man claims that he shot the president and gives detailed information about where he hid the gun nick follows the clues but every step of the way the people helping him seem to die in mysterious circumstances also his father pa kegan john huston a vulgar and disgustingly wealthy businessman keeps interfering with nick's investigation the deeper he delves into the assassination the more nick realises that he is descending into a web of complex lies and red herrings where nothing is as it seems and no one can be trusted br br the film is an utter nightmare to follow and in many ways is not worth trying to follow for the afore mentioned reason that it deliberately tangles itself up the cast is packed with extraordinary talent but most of them are wasted toshiro mifune has one of the briefest and most pointless cameo roles in cinematic history elizabeth taylor appears uncredited and has not a single line of dialogue richard boone is given what seems to be an interesting role but his character goes nowhere john huston has the best role as the powerful patriarch and provides us with the film's few enjoyable moments with his acerbic delivery anthony perkins also gets a creepy role and handles it well though his screen time is far too short to do complete justice to the character some nudity and sex scenes are tossed in for no real reason and while they're quite graphic and might appeal to voyeurs they really belong in another film the film's semi comic climax is farcical and disappointing yet paradoxically memorable in its weird little way there's obviously a cult audience out there somewhere for winter kills but i won't be counting myself among its number
i remember i saw this cartoon when i was 6 or 7 my grandfather picked up the video of it for free at the mall i remember that it really sucked the plot had no sense i hated the fox that became casper's friend he was so stupid casper cried his head off if he couldn't find a friend so what get over it the only good part and i don't want to sound mean spirited was when the fox got shot and died at the end i laughed my head off in payback because this cartoon sucked so much the bad news is the fox resurrects and becomes a ghost i wish he had stayed dead i think i even gave the video of this to somebody because i hated it no wonder they were offering it for free at the mall if you have a child don't let them watch this they will probably agree with me that it sucks
i do get irritated with modern adaptations of shakespeare when the director can't make his mind up whether to use the original or to update it if it's using the original words in an updated setting that's particularly tricky if set in the 20th or 21st century although it can work ok in period styles eg the trevor nunn twelfth night set late victorian very effectively it could work with the 30's setting if only there had been far less of the song and dance and far more of shakespeare's text unfortunately it just ends up being a pretty trivial though very pleasant show br br another problem is branagh himself i agree he's far too old to play one of the students but more important he's such an experienced shakespearean actor that in spite of all his efforts to be just another student his strength of acting shows all the time of course he should have played the king no problem in having a mature student king surrounded by younger students instead we had a pleasant but unimposing actor for the king thus an unimposing so called king with no kingly attributes br br the amount of song and dance which i found tedious in spite of the nice songs and pleasant enough dancing unfortunately meant the great shakespearean dialogue had to be cut down drastically so the whole thing ends up a trivial and mild confection and i got very bored including with the comic turns and was glad when it ended branagh has not done shakespeare justice in this production br br accolades however to richard briers and geraldine mcewan absolutely splendid as the older couple
this is to the zatoichi movies as the star trek movies were to star trek except that in this case every one of the originals was more entertaining and interesting than this big shiny re do and also better made if substance is more important than surface had i never seen them i would have thought this good looking but empty since i had i thought its style inappropriate and its content insufficient the idea of reviving the character in a bigger slicker production must have sounded good but there was no point in it other than the hope of making money it's just a show which mostly fails to capture the atmosphere of the character's world and wholly fails to take the character anywhere he hasn't been already also the actor wasn't at his best i'd been hoping to see ichi at a late stage of life in a story that would see him out gracefully and draw some conclusion from his experience overall this just rehashes bits and pieces from the other movies seasoned with more sex and sfx violence not the same experience at all
i thought this movie was really really great helena did an amazing job in it i thought she played her character very well she's an awesome actress br br the movie was also really funny too the jokes were great i couldnt stop laughing br br i think everyone should see it br br
being a filmmaker myself and possessing a somewhat dark and subversive sense of humour i thought i was in for a treat when i took home my wrongs not that the dvd cover gives anything away instead opting for the ambiguous quote from controversialist director chris morris a short film including scenes i should have known better really and avoided this insipid and often offensive piece of twoddle br br the scene in the church is repulsive to watch especially since we are all too familiar with morris's warped attitude towards paedophilia from his notorious tv series brass eye and serves no purpose other than to shock how this film is labelled a comedy i will never understand br br the runner's commentary sounds like a novel idea in principle having been a runner myself it's often an interesting and uninhibited perspective on the filmmaking process however this is sadly not the case here instead we are treated to some public schoolboy ranting about dogs on film before concluding that there are no really great movies starring dogs this is all very interesting but not worth a single frame of celluloid br br to say that this film goes nowhere would be an understatement it relies far too heavily upon its heightened style at the expense of plot character and dialogue leaving the viewer strangely perturbed and unfulfilled its over simplified message that man should take responsibility for his actions is both glaringly obvious and poorly illustrated br br the film does have its moments of pseudo kafkaesque surrealism but ultimately it fails to convince to entertain to enlighten and just ends up being irritating if you want to see a really great piece of short filmmaking i strongly recommend franz kafka's it's a wonderful life by peter capaldi
it's cheesy it's creepy it's gross but that's what makes it so much fun it's got over the top melodramatic moments that are just plain laughable this movie is great to make fun of rent it for a good laugh br br the film centers around three women newscasters during a time way before cellphones they go to a small town to cover a festival but they can't get a room to stay the night and that's when they meet ernest keller he's creepy in a psycho kind of way and he offers to let them stay at his home but he doesn't tell them the truth about who lives there br br stephen furst's performance is so amazing as the unseen that he really carries this film most of the movie is kind of dull although finding out the truth of ernest's family is kind of interesting br br just seeing this cast in these scenes makes it worth a look barbara bach and doug barr make nice eye candy br br i consider the movie an old gem hard to find and worth a look
i really enjoyed this film because i have a tremendous interest in american history the antebellum years and the civil war in particular i purchased it recently from a rack of previously viewed videos on sale at the supermarket and i was very glad to add this one to my history video collection though not of the caliber of civil war films such as glory or gettysburg provides a lot of history on the pre civil war brotherhood among cadets at west point br br maybe it's the gray uniforms the youth or the military discipline but i am fascinated by the story of the corps of cadets from around 1830 to the brink of the war i imagine what it must have been like to sit in a classroom with other young men learning how to make war then later putting the lessons to use against your own classmates br br actually there were two classes graduated in 1861 one class in may the other in june the movie makes no real mention of this except to mention henry a dupont first graduate of the may class and george custer last grad of the june class the reason for the two classes was not so much about the war but it was the result of switching back to a four year course of study after a few years of experimenting with a five year course i think the first class had attended five years the other for four as the movie portrays cadets were like brothers and often had nicknames for each other george fanny or autie custer alonzo lon cushing james beauty stuart for j e b stuart class of 1854 etc br br i say this film is santa fe trail as it should have been because that 1940 film while enjoyable really fudges history cadets from several different classes are all graduating together jeb stuart and george custer are portrayed as the best of friends and are side by side in stopping john brown's 1859 insurrection at harper's ferry in fact stuart and custer were never friends but enemies during the war they faced each other for the first time i think at gettysburg in 1863 stuart was at the harper's ferry raid but custer was still a cadet at the point when it took place br br fanny custer plays a role in class of '61 though his classmate chums dev o'neill and shelby peyton are fictional i believe they are respectively based on partick henry o'rorke and john pelham two people you can look up br br anyway i truly enjoy this film or any film which provides a window into mid 19th century america
main theme in this dirty harry is that revenge is a dish best served cold sandra locke is as cold in this film as she is beautiful locke is an 8 normally but with a deadly pistol in her purse cocked for the bad guys she climbs all the way up the scale to a 10 having been gang raped along with her younger sister some years ago locke as jennifer spencer has tried to block out the attack from her life as best she can her sister tho is almost comatose as a result of the trauma so the memory is never far from her mind one day jennifer sees one of her attackers on the street in s f she buys a pistol follows him to a bar lets him pick her up then when they're alone in his cadillac beginning to make love she shoots him once in the genitals once in the brain this in the opening scene ya gotta love this spunky lady she's got her priorities straight plus jennifer is a professional artist putting all her anger on canvas until now after executing her first perp jennifer curiously watches det insp harry callahan process the fresh crime scene after the body is found in the caddy then she insults some creepy teenage bucks who are hassling women on the street visits her sister in a nursing home then goes a'hunting in san paolo ca up the coast where the rape event took place years ago with more bullets in her suitcase and more resolve in her mind our heroine relives the rape inside her head with vivid recall as she comes closer to executing each subsequent rapist not uncommon to us right wingers when it comes to sentencing or executing a violent criminal don't be sorrowful for his own wretched humanity we remember the crime and the suffering he inflicted such recalled events steels jennifer to pull the trigger on each of her attackers once in the genitals once in the brain throughout the movie scenes of jennifer's revenge are interspersed with good il' dirty harry blowing away some gangstas in a coffee shop remember go ahead make my day later on he threatens to step on a punk kid who'd just insulted callahan in a courthouse elevator like he'd step on dog s t leaving a young female govt employee staring after clint as if to say i want to have your baby my favorite scene is only about 30 minutes into the action when harry threatens and frightens a murderous mafia boss named threlkis into a fatal coronary during his granddaughter's wedding reception at the mark hopkins hotel michael grazzo pantangeli in godfather ii does a wonderful job as the sinful mafia don even if he's only in one scene dying in a most convincing manner however harry's troubles aren't over with yet the elevator punk's gang and threlkis' henchmen each attempt to assassinate harry in two close ordered scenes and most of them bad guys end up dying horribly yup some of the gun play comes off as uninspired screen violence looking like clint the director may have been tired that day of shooting this movie but there's only so many ways you can dispatch a man with bullets the punk kids die much more creatively though as they both burn to death and drown in s f bay warms my heart with so much violent intent directed at insp callahan his bosses send him to san paolo to try to get some background on the 22 caliber vasectomy killing as jennifer spencer's crime is now known but not before harry delivers one of his famous sermons to the chowder headed liberals love that harry while our hero' up annoying the local cops and citizens in san paolo two more murders happen same m o on a sleazy lazy fisherman and on an equally creepy hardware entrepreneur then harry meets jennifer they find they both agree on subjects such as law and order making the guilty pay etc could a hot love scene be in the offing soon we're led to believe just that characters abound in this real man meets real woman crime drama and we get to meet a brassy bull dyke named raye parkins who's both irritating and entertaining raye set up jennifer's rape for her boyfriend years before and she'll get hers eventually the san paolo police chief played by reliable eastwood co star pat hingle the hanging judge in 'hang em high' is strangely at odds with callahan's detective work related to the 22 cal vasectomies until we find out that his own adolescent son was one of the gang of rapists much like jennifer's sister chief janning's son is now a comatose adult but driven mad by guilt it can't end here though the dyke's rapist boyfriend mick now a kinky sex jerk of a criminal drives in from vegas becuz raye's dropped a dime on jennifer summoning him up to san paolo to prevent more executions mick sleeps at raye's house but his timing is all wrong and he's arrested before he can spend more time with raye mostly due to the fact that she's since been sent to the island of the eternal lesboes by a shot from jennifer's revolver psycho mick makes bail at long last with jennifer gunning for him a desperate chase ensues as harry tries to keep these two from killing each other it all turns out well in the end with the good gal and the good guy walking off into the sunset together to a beautiful roberta flack blues song
well at least my theater group did lol so of course i remember watching grease since i was a little girl while it was never my favorite musical or story it does still hold a little special place in my heart since it's still a lot of fun to watch i heard horrible things about grease 2 and that's why i decided to never watch it but my boyfriend said that it really wasn't all that bad and my friend agreed so i decided to give it a shot but i called them up and just laughed first off the plot is totally stolen from the first one and it wasn't really clever not to mention they just used the same characters but with different names and actors tell me how did the pink ladies and t birds continue years on after the former gangs left not to mention the creator face motor cycle enemy gee what a striking resemblance to the guys in the first film as well as these t birds were just stupid and ridiculous br br another year at rydell and the music and dancing hasn't stopped but when a new student who is sandy's cousin comes into the scene he is love struck by a pink lady stephanie but she must stick to the code where only pink ladies must stick with the t birds so the new student decides to train as a t bird to win her heart so he dresses up as a rebel motor cycle bandit who can ride well and defeat the evil bikers from easily kicking the t bird's butts but will he tell stephanie who he really is or will she find out on her own well find out for yourself br br grease 2 is like a silly tv show of some sort that didn't work the gang didn't click as well as the first grease did not to mention frenchy coming back was a bit silly and unbelievable because i thought that she graduated from rydell but apparently she didn't the songs were not really that catchy i'm glad that michelle was able to bounce back so fast but that's probably because she was the only one with talent in this silly little sequel i wouldn't really recommend this film other than if you are curious but i warned you this is just a pathetic attempt at more money from the famous musical br br 2 10
mesmerizing breathtaking and horrifying this hauntingly beautiful film is the apocalypse now without fiction slow in pace quiet in mood it gives good glimpses of the poisoned patches of earth that may well be signs of an inevitable doom br br there is no doubt in my mind the nature is plagued and we are the disease greed the very essence of humanity that drives evolution and progress has turned us into something like cancer on its way to consume the host and die with it br br manufactured landscapes is quite an unforgettable viewing experience at least i'll never regard my toaster and iron the same way again
a wonderful movie anyone growing up in an italian family will definitely see themselves in these characters a good family movie with sadness humor and very good acting from all you will enjoy this movie we need more like it
when i heard the plot for this movie i simply had to see it i mean whole cities being wiped out by killer tomatoes sadly the title is about as funny as it gets br br led by detective dick mason a special team of military and scientists including greg colburn who never takes his scuba outfit off and lt finletter who is never pictured without his parachute trailing behind 'attack of the killer tomatoes' is a parody of b movies in particular japanese horror of the 1950's the film begins with a standard sized tomato being discovered by a women washing up in her kitchen before we find ourselves in a middle of a crime scene as the tomato has supposedly murdered this lady and let me tell you it doesn't get any saner as the film progresses to be fair there are a couple of funny moments for instance anytime the japanese scientist dr nokitofa speaks his voice is dubbed over in an american accent or when disguise expert sam smith infiltrates the tomatoes 'hey can somebody please pass the ketchup ' equally this film was probably a lot funnier in 1978 with the whole so bad its good concept unfortunately for 'attack of the killer tomatoes' spoof films such as the 'airplane' and 'naked gun' series have been released and done this kind of comedy a lot better since br br the acting is atrocious there is zero continuity in the editing and it just feels genuinely slow and lacking energy for a parody film to work you need a lot of things happening at once one gag after the over the singing in the film seems pointless and the adverts for the furniture store that flash across the screen are damn right bizarre even for this film ultimately however you can see why this film is a cult one i can't see many people being indifferent to it unfortunately terrible would be the way i would sum this up
i enjoyed this film it was a joy to see a version so close to the vision of peter o'donnell br br a number of people have disliked the film but it has to be seen in context of the origin story that it is the film uses flashback to show the young modesty and the events that shaped her into the woman that she became before the network before willie garvin br br the pace is a trifle slow and for my taste not enough tension is developed in the present day scenes however this is acceptable just to get such a faithful version br br if you like modesty blaise you will enjoy it even with its faults if you just want an action flick with car chases forget it br br it has the feeling of being the first of a franchise but as i have never seen it promoted anywhere i suspect there will be no more to follow sadly
all the talent mr sooraj barjatya showed in his first 3 movies i thought were all an accident because his 4th one main prem ki diwani hoon was so bad but i have to say it wasn't an accident this guy is talented and the way he has done vivah is just brilliant right from the first scene it affects you the sequences between shahid and amrita are awesome the chemistry between these two actors gives glimpses of that between srk and kajol as usual alok nath as the good and loving father is fantastic so is anupam kher but its a shahid amrita film amrita looks good in most scenes though shahid does look a little young to get married but he does a good job of a shy but yet morally strong groom this movie will especially be liked by those who has gone through such beautiful moments in their life all in all a brilliant film hats off to mr sooraj barjatya
i almost didn't rent this because of all the bad comments but did anyways i thought it was similar to darkness falls which i also liked the only part i hated about the tooth ferry was the 2 red neck brothers at the gas station they were funny and the dialog made me laugh but this was not a comedy it ruined the movie a bit for me because it was unnecessary the rest of the movie was the way a horror or suspense film should be the make up was good and i have seen way worse movies then this one it was a simple story with believable acting it's not the scariest or goriest movie but i wasn't ticked off or wanting a refund after watching it on the dvd there was previews of other movies that all look good and i'm gonna check them out
stewart is a wyoming cattleman who dreams to make enough money to buy a small ranch in utah ranch his only real companion is his sidekick ben tatum the great walter brennan to accomplish that they drive the cattle clear to alaska and on to dawson in canadian territory where they sell them br br along the way they meet the man who runs the gold crazy town behind a dishonest lawman john mcintire he attempts to steal them the herd later in dawson mcintire and his gang reappear this time interfering with stewart's gold claim br br captured by mann's camera in the wonderful scenery of the canadian rockies stewart is a thoughtful loner forced into violence by his need to get rid of the treacherous actions of a corrupt entrepreneur robbing local miners of their claims br br in this entertaining beautiful western stewart has two leading ladies to struggle with ruth roman a bit too valuable to describe as a sexy woman resisting the worst vicissitudes of the territory and the more docile the french canadian girl corinne calvet who does create a nice portrait of a likable girl with the ability to form a judgment in spontaneous manner stewart is lost between the ostentatious saloon owner and the wife candidate
what great locations a visual challenge to all those who put their eye behind the lens this little jewel is an amazing account of what you can shoot in just 16 days good going folks i can not wait to see what your next feature will be i'll be with you all the way
i can say without a shadow of a doubt that going overboard is the single worst film i have ever seen and yes i have seen cujo adam sandler is an abomination as schecky moskowitz a wannabe comedian working on a cruise liner that's the plot br br that's it nothing else in the film makes sense it's all over the place like a mad man's breakfast and not in a wacky naked gun kind of way but more of a frustrating 'throw both shoes at the t v' kind of way even general noriega makes an appearance for no reason i can comprehend it certainly wasn't for humour add to the mix miss australia who has the worst australian accent i've ever heared and you have something which i won't call the worst film ever made because going overboard doesn't even fit the basic definition of a film i highly recomend seeing this film as it will elevate the standing of every bad film you ever see i guarantee the first thing you'll say after seeing a bad film will be at least it wasn't as bad as going overboard
i saw this movie on cable it was really funny from the stereotype police chief to the stereotype big bad guys jay leno and mr mayagi from karate kid star in this good comedy about a prototype car part i compare this movie to rush hour in which a local cop has to partner up with an asian police officer to solve a case the chase through farmers market in downtown detroit brings back memories enjoyable soundtrack good script i give it 10 10
the film did what it set out to do show how a young girl copes with poverty and grows into her maturity however for most of us this subject has been explored adequately and in most instances with more sophistication than done here the movie fixated on breasts which soon became boring and i lost interest if this was on tv i would've switched to the latest news on the starr report that's how boring i found this movie
the scenes are fast paced the characters are great i love anne marie johnson's acting i really like the ending br br however i was disappointed that this movie didn't delve deeper into achilles's and athena's relationship it only blossomed when they kissed each other
i saw this movie last month at a free sneak preview and i walked out it was pretty horrible in the process of trying too hard they over acted and made a horrible movie i was disappointed since i felt all the actors had made respectable choices in the past so this one couldn't be that far off the mark but i was wrong i was hoping they would give out a survey at the end of the movie so i could tell them not to release this movie i was lured in by the free aspect of the preview but it turned out to be a waste of my time and usually i'm very easily amused it tried to be innovative and creative with the shots ideas and filming but because they threw together so many ideas at once it failed i'm not usually picky about movies and i usually don't feel the need to display my opinions about movies but i had to warn everyone not to watch it i registered on imdb just to tell all of you guys
sure this one isn't really a blockbuster nor does it target such a position dieter is the first name of a quite popular german musician who is either loved or hated for his kind of acting and thats exactly what this movie is about it is based on the autobiography dieter bohlen wrote a few years ago but isn't meant to be accurate on that the movie is filled with some sexual offensive content at least for american standard which is either amusing not for the other actors of course or dumb it depends on your individual kind of humor or on you being a bohlen fan or not technically speaking there isn't much to criticize speaking of me i find this movie to be an ok movie
after seeing all the jesse james quantrill jayhawkers etc films in the fifties it is quite a thrill to see this film with a new perspective by director ang lee the scene of the attack of lawrence kansas is awesome the romantic relationship between jewel and toby mcguire turns out to be one of the best parts and jonathan rhys meyers is outstanding as the bad guy all the time this film makes you feel the horror of war and the desperate situation of the main characters who do not know if they are going to survive the next hours definitely worth seeing
this film is famous for several qualities a literate script for once in partly religious film making by philip dunne some very good performances a first rate production in every department and its intelligent direction by veteran henry king if one were making a film then getting such talents as leon shamroy as cinematographer lyle wheeler as art director and alfred newman as composer of original music would guarantee a quality production add the cast of this film including gregory peck and susan hayward as the title characters james robertson justice raymond massey kieron moore jayne meadows and john sutton plus a dance by gwen verdon and expectations might be raised that the resulting film could be made into something special but in a biblical subject script usually a sub genre prone to illogical motivations and miraculous interventions everything would ultimately depend on the author's skills philip dunne here has supplied human beings a rare achievement in biblical films david is a man in this film many sided not someone doing mythical deeds on paper in the old testament gregory peck makes him curious passionate self controlled self deprecating and appealing as bathsheba hayward is scarcely the perfect choice but conveys a good deal of common sense earthiness and emotional normalcy that helps one see why the king of israel would risk so much for her the rest of the cast is stalwart and capable by turns the familiar storyline provides them little to work with but author dunne and the cast do as much as is possible with the human situations david's youth is told in flashback how he was chosen by a prophet of yahweh to be king of israel and earns his way to be second to the king saul by defeating goliath the phiiistine in battle when all else are afraid to beard the giant warrior thereafter he finally is driven from the court of king saul of israel becomes a famous warrior and returns to claim the kingdom and become the instrument of death of jonathan the king's son formerly a friend his wars are successful the film opens in fact with a successful attack scene but his life is empty since his wife michal jayne meadows is saul's daughter and is cold to him he turns to bathsheba whom he sees from the palace roof bathing naked later she admits she had hoped he would see her but she has a husband uriah when she becomes pregnant it becomes necessary for uriah to come in from the battlefield and spend time at home he instead asks david to set him in the forefront of the battle even after being aroused by verdon's dance david agrees he is killed a war hero but this does not solve the infidelity question drought comes to israel and the king's infidelity is blamed for the phenomenon at last david places his hands on the ark of the covenant recently brought to jerusalem and housed in a temple which has caused the death of others who accidentally came in contact with it inviting his god to punish him and nothing happens david exits the temple and finds that rain has come to his parched land this film is always interesting varied in its types of scenes and physically beautiful the director and author make use of the observer principle and are frankly more successful in humanizing the characters than in almost any film outside the grecianized near eastern canon wherein the feat is a bit easier since neither miraculous nor religious themes are made central in such adventures well remembered for its glowing realization fine performances and intelligent dialogue this dramatic effort bears repeated study
fungicide is quite possibly the most incompetent embarrassing pitiful film i have ever seen the acting is criminal the direction practically non existent and the special effects presumably put together by unleashing a monkey with learning difficulties on a defenceless laptop computer br br far be it from me to stifle creativity but i actually believe things like this shouldn't be made i am sure the film makers will say that yes the film was hampered by a low as in nothing budget but in that case they just really shouldn't have bothered as it is they have offered the world something so dire so execrable that only imbeciles could get the merest shade of enjoyment from it br br starting the movie it wasn't as though i was expecting citizen kane or anything i was expecting a low budget little horror with perhaps a modicum of inventiveness a hint of fun and even some energy what i got was the cinematic equivalent of a used handkerchief br br the plot well our leering antihero scientist who works in his parents' basement is seen manically stirring some goo in a cup apparently such high level science is the end result of years of research his parents then send him off to a strange hotel type place in the countryside to relax there are some other people there who are simply too awful to write about anyway the scientist drops his test tube onto some mushrooms and soon the mushrooms grow and kill some people wow i'm getting suicidal just writing the plot summary our heroes save the day by detonating a barrel of balsamic vinegar by attaching a fuse really a piece of string to it the barrel unaccountably explodes with the power of a small nuclear weapon destroying all the mushrooms the end thank goodness br br that summary is as good as the film gets and actually makes it sound a lot more interesting than it actually is it really should never have got past this stage of development by which i mean a plot outline scribbled on the back of an envelope with crayons somebody should have really stepped in and given someone a vigorous shake and said no br br and those special effects well they're special all right this is cgi gone crazy and done by a person who i can only assume believes the bicycle pump to be the pinnacle of modern technology and when the mushroom monsters are not in the style of a 1984 home computer graphics package they are represented by actors shuffling along covered in a sheet i kid you not br br one of the most inexcusable things about the movie is its laziness this can be summed up by the scene in which the hero spins his guns a la clint eastwood and then fails miserably to get them in his pockets i mean come on a couple of retakes and he could have pulled it off but just to leave it as it is really weak br br i cannot believe money was spent on this camcorder shot rubbish the film makers should hang their heads in shame and be banned from going within fifty metres of any movie making equipment br br i also think it's wrong that friends and family of the makers come onto imdb and post mendacious reviews and give stupidly high user ratings which give a totally inaccurate picture of the movie fungicide is an absolute travesty of film making mr wascavage is either very very stupid or very very cynical
for a film that's ostensibly about sex and leather it doesn't have any right to be as oddly sweet as it is the story of bettie page a good christian girl from the south who's momma wouldn't let her date until she married who moved to new york and ended up becoming the most successful pin up of her age is driven by an outstanding performance from gretchen moll her page can't quite reconcile the pictures that she takes nobody's allowed to touch it's all fun and respectful with the pornography trials and supposed ill effects that her images have on the world around her br br page has been an inspiration to every burlesque artist since not just because she had a figure to die for but because she invested every picture with an innocent sense of fun that was uniquely sexy and simple at the same time rather like this film in fact filmde in both black and white and glorious technicolour it's a lovely way to spend a couple of hours
delirious near plot less mood piece and if it's more lsd inspired than the devil then we must remember when it was made after a startling sm opening which even itself is not what it seems we move to soft focus and dream or imaginings or remembering lots of literary and cinematic references and indeed this is the franco film that lang himself praised beautiful and mesmerising the film unfolds at a leisurely pace but has a richness within each fold a rare movie to languish within old jess could make 'em when he tried fine central performances too including the indomitable jack taylor and howard vernon i haven't even mentioned the lisbon locations ah
maya is a woman without any interests she just dreams her life away and wonders why she does not feel fulfilled this could be an interesting topic that would need a good story a nice setting and good dialogues it doesn't have any of these this movie is totally boring there are only lengths and no climaxes the only climax is shahrukh khan but although i am a huge fan of his i couldn't stand this movie even he can't make this movie exiting the movie is not as bad as king uncle and if you're an art house fan or like it slow you might maybe like it it's not funny it's not interesting it's not catching my recommendation don't watch it
this is one of the most boring horror films i have ever seen as it's absolutely god awful john carradine has very limited screen time all the characters are boring and the story is terrible plus i could see the two twists at the end coming miles away the great setting and the creepy house definitely would have helped if it wasn't so damn boring and there isn't one character to root for either plus i hope it makes it's way to the bottom 100 because it deserves to be there in my opinion when john carradine finally shows up at the end it's a pretty good scene but it's already way too late and the only other screen time he had was in flashbacks plus the only really gory scene in the movie is when a character gets his face messed up by bee's as it was rather gory i got this in a dvd horror set called back from the grave and everyone really overacts in my opinion plus it's lucky this was included in a set i bought otherwise i would have chucked this out the window this is one of the most boring horror films i have ever seen as it's absolutely god awful john carradine has very limited screen time and i say avoid it like the plague you don't want to go through the torture the direction is absolutely terrible carl monson does an absolutely terrible job here making every thing look cheap wasting his potential on making creepy atmosphere and just keeping the film at an incredibly dull pace the acting is just as bad john carradine is good in his scene but other then that he's hardly in the film other then flashback scenes carradine ruled merry anders overacts here terribly as laura as she didn't convince me at all ivy bethune is ok and somewhat creepy but also overacted she did have a creepy smile at the end though rest of the cast i didn't pay enough attention too as i had a lot of trouble getting through it but they were all really bad overall please avoid this it's not worth the agony bomb out of 5
as it is in heaven spoiler warning br br this was a great human drama that stimulated my emotions and my imagination br br this is a parable revisiting the life and death of christ daniel is a superior gifted musician who is physically and mentally exhausted by his career and has to give it up when he joins a church choir as its cantor he brings about a transformation in the lives of the choristers just as jesus did to the society in first century palestine they laugh they begin to speak openly and truthfully to each other their faults are exposed they accept each other come to love each other become a vital community they include the mentally disabled young man tore such is their inclusiveness br br the pastor stig enjoyed authority through imposing a stifling morality on the congregation and that is gradually rejected by the choristers when stig dismisses daniel there is a revolt and stig is crushed stig represents the jewish authorities of jesus' day whose insistence on obedience to the jewish law provided a stark contrast to the new life by the golden rule brought by jesus br br in one dramatic scene someone declares the church invented sin all through the film there is this contrast between moral ism and vital living being br br true to the christ story daniel is killed by conny when he beats him up leaves him to drown in the river next scene we can hardly believe it when daniel's resurrected body is dragged into his room the tomb draped in a white linen sheet the shroud by three women three women kept vigil at the foot of the cross in the gospel br br daniel is drawn closely to lena a warm beautiful young woman who has been betrayed by a man she loved and who is now promiscuous jesus developed a close relationship with mary magdalene lena who was probably a high class courtesan prostitute through lena daniel learns to love something he has longed for and now finds fulfillment br br the solo sung by gabriella composed by daniel is all about living a full life in contrast to moral correctness that leads to concern about sin and what's right and wrong br br the final scene shows the choir all singing humming in harmony like a mantra drawing in the large audience exemplifying the harmony and inter connectedness that is our true human destiny
i used to love watching sabrina the teenage witch friday nights on abc's tgif i think this was one of the best shows on tgif my friends and i used to get together every friday just to watch this show and we never missed an episode br br my favorite character was salem he was adorable and sooo funny i liked sabrina's boyfriend harvey too he was hot i think melissa joan hart played a good teenage witch too my favorite episodes were sabrina through the looking glass and hilda and zelda the teenage years those episodes were great br br overall i really miss this show i hope one day abc brings it back with new episodes i give this show 10 10 stars
i like bad movies i like to rent bad movies with my friends and rip on them for their duration then there are abhorrent movies like this redline is not just a bad movie but a telling sign that maybe the american movie industry should please for the sake of the viewer at least proofread scripts before funding a movie br br if a stereotype took a crap this movie would spawn from that the storyline is unbearable and the acting all around is laughable nadia bjorlin and eddie griffin have perhaps the worst screen chemistry i've seen in a good while and even individually they should be isolated from humanity and beaten with a bag of oranges until they change their profession to street merchants about the only thing they can legitimately qualify for furthermore how angus macfadyen got convinced to do this movie is so far beyond me that i can't even think of an analogy i am a loyal fan of his but this has made me question him br br to sum it up several people want revenge for different reasons and if you care enough to know what they are you're a bigger person than me so much so that it turns to violence i guess the movie is like ouroboros the snake that swallows its own tail in that it's an endless cycle of confusion and dialogue not fit for human ears this movie is essentially one big car commercial for the first half and an indecipherable action movie for the rest it should be avoided at any and all costs br br i wish i could find one positive aspect to this movie and i think it lies in the fact that eventually the credits do roll br br p s nadia bjorlin if that was you singing those two songs in this movie then you are a hack and i hope old age ravages you br br p s s if you do rent this movie looking for a laughable experience listen for the lyrics to nadia bjorlin's awesome songs
granted this seems like a good idea steve martin goldie hawn and john cleese in a neil simon comedy where can you go wrong watch the movie and you'll find out br br in truth martin the lead is mis cast he's not doing the great slapstick he's known for from movies like the jerk but instead plays a sort of in between character that doesn't work hawn with no one to play off of is terrible cleese is the only even partially funny member br br to top it off the plot is pretty stupid i can't say how much of it may have been changed but the characters seem to lack the slightest bit of common sense they blunder through new york not doing anything right and unfortuneatly nothing funny not only is the whole premise completely unbelievable it seems to give the message that people who don't live in new york aren't very bright a theme repeated throughout the movie br br in summation instead of seeing this go rent the original odd couple again
this movie was kind of interesting i had to watch it for a college class about india however the synopsis tells you this movie is about one thing when it doesn't really contain much cold hard information on those details it is not really true to the synopsis until the very end where they sloppily try to tie all the elements together the gore factor is superb however even right at the very beginning you want to look away because the gore is pretty intense only watch this movie if you want to see some cool gore because the plot is thin and will make you sad that you wasted time listening to it i've seen rumors on other websites about this movie being based on true events however you can not find any information about it online so basically this movie was a waste of time to watch
what a horrible comedy totally lame the supposed humor was simple and stupid stanly tucci a great actor had the only parts worth chuckling at and he was tied up and gagged at the time don't waste your time with this one it deserves a 0 10
a classy offering from amicus producer milton subotsky and director peter duffell 'the far pavillions' etc turn in a classy intelligent 'four hander' with a strong cast peter cushing christopher lee jon pertwee ingrid pitt etc all giving stylish performances despite a low budget which results in a few 'un special effects' the most outstanding contribution however is that of the 7 year old chloe franks who turns in chillingly effective account of her part which makes one's blood run cold only spoilt by the lurid title wished on the film by its distributors this underrated release a cut above the run of the mill 'blood 'n' guts' shocker movie is for those who appreciate a little thought with their horror
i watch lots of scary movies or at least they try to be and this has to be the worst if not 2nd worst movie i have ever had to make myself try to sit through i never knew the depths of masacism until i rented this piece of moldy cheese covered in a used latex contraceptive i am a fan of julian sans but this is worse than i would hope for him br br on the other hand the story was promising and i was intrigued for the first minute and a half while the credits rolled and i had yet to see what pain looked like first hand perhaps there are some viewers out there that enjoyed this and can point me in the right direction but then again i know of those viewers who understand if not commemorate me especially when we had to turn the video off and that simply is not done with our watching we had to make one exception obviously br br if it were up for a remake i'd give it a chance so long as they had at most 1 of the original incorporated into it that's all
i saw true crime when it was first released back in the mid nineties and i have watched it many times since it is a great mystery about mary played by alicia silverstone a high school senior in a california town who's classmate's younger sister was tortured and killed by an unknown murderer mary meets tony played by kevin dillon a police cadet who sees how bright she is and they decide to work together to try to find the killer br br many suspects in this one true crime feels very true or real to me i read a newsgroup review where someone wrote that total suspension of disbelief is present here and it is so true alicia silverstone is perfect in this role and kevin dillon and bill nunn do a great job as do the other actors the locations are right on and the writer director pat verducci really captures some of the realities of teenage life and of mary's loneliness see the scene where mary awakens from the dream sequence after having viewed the photos she took of tony i wish verducci would make more movies br br i have not seen any other movie quite like true crime 10 10
utterly predictable silly show about a man who has killed his wife by mowing her down when driving and claimed he had blacked out why was he still driving a car why did he still feel able to drive a car having killed his wife with one this question has not occurred to the writers the story then witters on about a psychologist and her failing marriage which is tied into the failing marriage of wife killing blackout driver an omniscient mother and one dimensional child are thrown in for good measure and the whole builds up to a predictable denouement and crashing finale are police psychologists so easily taken in deadful writing that the actors do their best with but they are doomed to failure this is on a par with a harlequin romance don't waste your time watching this one unless that's what you are aiming for
no one should ever try to adapt a tom robbins book for screen while the movie is fine and the performances are good the dialogue which works well reading it is crap when spoken or to put it another way no one would be likely to suggest that hearing someone else's name was like seeing it written in radium on a pearl br br overall the movie feels like a badly adapted cliffs notes to the book most of the parts have been hacked down to a fifth of their size in the book in terms of backstory and current story and the ending is wildly and unpleasantly different from that of the book most of the plots from the book have gotten lost including the one that makes everything make sense at the end and there's more than one reference that makes sense in the book that makes the viewer say huh not a worthy effort unfortunately the script should have been read compared to the book burned and all the actors sent off to do something far better i admire gus van sant tremendously but not even someone of his calibre could have made a decent movie of such a complex book without making a miniseries
i question anyone saying they don't care for this movie some reviewers have said it didn't have enough action some said it was too long etc don't listen to them if you like shawshank redemption and or braveheart you will definitely love this movie br br the acting performances are superb tim roth john hurt and jessica lang are allsuperb and liam neeson does an admarible job and is a very imposing character because of his size the cinemaphotography was brilliant and breathtaking it is onw of the few movies i have seen in my life along with shawshank that was virtually flawless from casting directing writing acting etc br br i was amazed this wasn't in the top 50 or 100 movies reviewed i felt so passionately about it that i just registered with imdb so i could let everyone know the real scoop i have seen this movie about 10 times each time with a different person and everyone has loved it you must be awake and pay attention carefully for the first 30 minutes because they introduce quite a few characters in the beginning if you have the attention span longer than most of these juvenille kids writing reviews for the movies on this site than you will love this movie come on all 3 lord of the rings movies in the top 9 and the matrix at 32 that should show you the age range of most reviewers here br br this is a top 50 movie
david aames is a rich good looking guy who lives in new york city when his 'sleeping partner' julie gianni gets very jealous after david falls for spanish beauty sofia she gets david into her car and tells him that he's the only guy she loves and wants to be with but seeing as he's in love with sofia she decides to commit suicide with david in the car with her by driving off a bridge david survives the crash but is left with a disfigured face he is then charged with the murder of julie the thing is david doesn't know what's real and what's not as he keeps having these strange dreams most of which are actually nightmares and flashbacks some of which just don't make sense to him everything will soon come back to him though as he's begins to find out the truth br br well there's an all star cast here including tom cruise penélope cruz cameron diaz kurt russell jason lee and noah taylor who all give good performances in the movie in the movie they all put off different things about there characters like happiness sadness angry etc really well there's also a cameo in the movie from the brilliant steven spielberg br br vanilla sky is a well made different interesting and original movie which will leave you talking about it a lot after it's finished it's not just a thriller but it's a real psychological thriller the trailer for the movie is really good but the movie is so different from what it might be made out to be it's been directed very well and there were a couple of really great scenes here too all in all an enjoyable movie which should be really be paid attention too they are sure making a lot of are they dead if not who is dead movies recently
every now and then there gets released this movie no one has ever heard of and got shot in a very short time with very little money and resource but everybody goes crazy about and turns out to be a surprisingly great one this also happened in the '50's with quite a few little movies that not a lot of people have ever heard of there are really some unknown great surprising little jewels from the '50's that are worth digging out panic in the streets is another movie like that that springs to the mind both are movies that aren't really like the usual genre flicks from their time and are also made with limited resources br br i was really surprised at how much i ended up liking this movie it was truly a movie that got better and better as it progressed like all 'old' movies it tends to begin sort of slow but once you get into the story and it's characters you're in for a real treat with this movie br br the movie has a really great story that involves espionage though the movie doesn't start of like that it begins as this typical crime thriller with a touch of film noir to it but pickup on south street just isn't really a movie by the numbers so it starts to take its own directions pretty soon on it ensures that the movie remains a surprising but above all also really refreshing one to watch br br i also really liked the characters within this movie none of them are really good guys and they all of their flaws and weaknesses really humane it also especially features a great performance from thelma ritter who even received a well deserved oscar nomination for it has really got to be one of the greatest female roles i have ever seen br br even despite its somewhat obvious low budget this is simply one great original special little movie that deserves to be seen by more br br 10 10
i haven't seen this in over 20yrs but i still remember things about it br br this film could not have been made in color the stark grays are what make it and was life really that simple in the 1950's what stands out the most in my memory is perry smith going to the gallows his breathing under the hood just before they sprung the trap i don't think i could watch that again once is plenty it's like that unnamed guy at the beginning of papillon who is dragged out in terror to the guillotine the guy that said watch this on a double bill with dead man walking should have added the last 10 minutes of i want to live as well br br some of my ancestors being aristos went to the guillotine in 1794 95 so my feelings on the death penalty are rather intense
two years later bill alex winter and ted keanu reeves are becoming near rock stars in the present future but still needing more work in their instruments in the future bill ted are in the public popular history but then a evil man joss ackland is set to kill bill ted by sending cyborg look likes to destroy them cyborgs are sent to the past present and they actually murder the real bill ted now both guys are spirits and they have to travel through heaven and hell to save themselves and their future br br directed by peter hewitt tom and huck the borrowers made a clever sequel with terrific visual effects much more funny and entertaining than the original william sadler the shawshank redemption steals the show as the grim reaper br br dvd has an good anamorphic widescreen 1 85 1 transfer and an fine dolby digital 5 1 surround sound dvd has the theatrical trailer and an amusing behind the scenes featurette this sequel was a box office hit like the original but it is also believe it or not one of the best sequels ever made depending on your point of view george carlin reprises his role from the original briefly pam grier also appears in a bit role it's a enjoyable fantasy comedy
my god buttgereit's masterpiece is one of the best movies i've ever seen closer to peter greenaway and jean luc godard's movies this one is really disturbing but not gruesome as the nekromantiks all the little stories have a deep philosophic interest and the directing is totally inventive in spite of the lack of money see the bridge sketch highly highly recommended
in light of bad reviews or car crashes i feel possessed to get in gear and make a transmission to give merit where due and do a service i'm not sure people have license to say it was so bad almost automatically br br it's rare for a movie to have suspense this movie maintained suspense it's whole length for me despite any flaws that may be how many films can say that not even many big ones because of the simple premise you don't know if the people will get out of the life threatening situation which lasts the whole movie yeh the suspension was tight and over some bumps the shocks did their work it's not just a tv movie but an all action movie there is no point where it stops or deviates or becomes talky it would be hard to make a film like this always on the road only duel or speed are this that i recall the best thing in them also was the constant tension br br acting is not bad the judge is as good as ever and the others are br br script is good but the jury is out as to whether it sometimes may be or seem to be a little awry what seems unrealistic is not necessarily so your first judgments are not always right but i think the lead actor's was right in being in this movie br br stunts are mostly terrific especially for a tv movie their only failing may be the noticeable and again apparent slow speed but we all know how deceivingly slow grand prix cars can look br br i liked that the beginning said inspired by a true story so you are not going to go how much is true you know just the basis is the usual based on a true story makes me think it should mostly be true but maybe that's my error br br how to save them good idea of the reviewer to suggest a tow truck to lift the back wheels up just a few inches would do a stunt driver could do that at 100 mph odd that they didn't call a car expert or auto electrician or mechanic to see if there's a way br br i hope this review has put in reverse that this film is a disaster or at least neutral and help it become a runaway success br br pic quality is a little soft for a dvd br br spoiler they would have been winched out after the baby was but strangely that life saving idea was cleverly dealt with in some joking conversation to fade it out i guess we know why end of movie suspension of disbelief went out the top window with the baby
one could wish that an idea as good as the invisible man would work better and be more carefully handled in the age of fantastic special effects but this is not the case the story the characters and finally the entire last 20 minutes of the film are about as fresh as a mad scientist flick from the early 50's there are some great moments mostly due to the amazing special effects and to the very idea of an invisible man stalking the streets but alas soon we're back in the cramped confinement of the underground lab which means that the rest of the film is not only predictable but schematic br br there has been a great many remakes of old films or tv shows over the past 10 years and some of them have their charms but it's becoming clearer and clearer for each film that the idea of putting ol' classics under the noses of eager madmen like verhoeven who does have his moments is a very bad one it is obvious that the money is the key issue here the time and energy put into the script is nowhere near enough and as a result hollow man is seriously undermined with clichés sappy characters predictability and lack of any depth whatsoever br br however the one thing that actually impressed me beside the special effects was the swearing when making this kind of film modern producers are very keen on allowing kids to see them therefore the language and sometimes the violence and sex is very toned down when the whole world blows up the good guys go oh darn and oh my god hollow man gratefully discards that kind of hypocrisy and the characters are at liberty to say what comes most natural to them i'm not saying that the most natural response to something gone wrong is to swear but it makes it more believable if someone actually swears i think we can thank verhoeven for that

kurt russell is so believable and the action so non stop that it takes thinking about it afterward to realize that there were honest to goodness important themes overcoming fear of the stranger learning to rise above early conditioning the strength that love and friendship can bring etc in the storyline this is so very rare for a 'guy's action flick' that even i who thinks most a a is violent pap liked the film and have recommended it to every guy i know it's a shame this one was overlooked because by rights it should have been one of the biggest action adventure box office hits it has something for everyone without straining credulity or losing the nearly non stop action moments i'm afraid the answer to it not becoming a hit lies in the fact that adults did not go to see it anyone under 20 probably has not only seen more violent action in their video games but probably would either not catch the multi layered multi themed beauty or not care about it this film could convert anyone who avoids a a as mindless violence if a guy takes his lady or rents it or sees it in a cable listing to see this film he'll be much more likely to get her to go with him to other action flicks

pearl s buck was a brilliant author that was a first american lady won nobel prize in literature in 1938 and received her prize with enrico fermi an italian physit br br she wrote this romance in 1931 which was a second one after her first novel east wind and west wind in 1930 and her beginning in literature was fantastic upon her premier novels br br she won in 1935 pulitzer prize in literature on her eternal novel the good earth which made a brilliant panorama on the life of chinese peasant wung lung and his wife o lane and their efforts to face the hardness of hard positions in their earth to reach for their big fortune by their shoulders br br paul muni succeeded in this role as chinese peasant that he prepared himself in this role upon his sittings with chinese people in san francisco in their town to be chinese exactly as a real and true br br shara reiner succeeded in her role as o lane by this brilliant evidence that she won an academy awarded as a best actress in 1937
i saw this film yesterday i rented the dvd from blockbuster in fact i know one of the actresses from the film i won't say who that's kept under wraps but i must admit it wasn't as good as i thought it would be tom savini hats down to this guy but it's a shame he wasn't in the film for long what lacks the film is the idea the script sound etc it may look like a good movie but it wasn't that entertaining br br well i'm glad my sister paid £10 for renting 3 dvd's from blockbuster i chose this one and i was disappointed anyway thumbs down for me not my cup of tea 0 out of 10
i am 13 and i hated this film its the worst film on earth i totally wasted my time watching it and was disappointed with it cause on the cover and on the back the film it looks pretty good but i was wrong its bad but when i saw delta she was totally different and a bad actress and i really didn't know how old the 2 girls was trying to be i was so confused the film was in some parts confusing and i didn't enjoy it at all but i watched all the film just to see if it was going to get better but it didn't it was boring dull and did i say boring and i don't think many other people liked it as well as me boring boring boring
like 'first blood' this attempts to make a point about the treatment of vietnam vets but there really isn't much time for that in between the monotonous gunfire burnings stabbings torture and explosions as an impossibly indestructible rambo takes out half of asia a ton of vietnamese soldiers most of the russian army various vehicles and anything else he can point a rocket launcher at the only woman in the middle of all these boys toys is soon bumped off allowing the testosterone to reach dangerous levels and the script to degenerate into a succession of loud noises helpfully supplying a few hackneyed musical cues is jerry goldsmith who carefully checks off all the clichéd themes from russian rat a tat to chinese ching chang chong just in case we don't quite understand who we're looking at stallone has a brain in his head this empty nonsense is beneath him
i was literally preparing to hate this movie so believe me when i say this film is worth seeing overall the story and gags are contrived but the film has the charm and finesse to pull them off that gag where jason lee thinks he has crabs and tries not to let his boss future father in law and co workers see him scratching himself isn't terribly intelligent but it sent me into a frenzy of laughter very few of the film's gags are high brow but they made me laugh as i said the film has charm and charm can go a long way br br the characters are likable too i must say i wish i got to see more of james brolin's character since he was a hoot in the very few scenes he was in plus i admire any romantic comedy that has the guts to not make the character of the wife who serves as the obstacle in the plot a total witch the selma blair character is hardly unlikable and there's never a scene where i thought to myself why did he want to marry her in the first place the ending is hollywood ish but it could've been much more schmaltzy br br the cast is talented i haven't had a favorable view of most of jason lee's mainstream work i just loved him so much in kevin smith's films that i couldn't help but feel disappointed at seeing him in these dopey roles and he never looks comfortable in these dopey roles even in this movie he doesn't look perfectly comfortable but he contributes his own two cents and effectively handles each scene but i still miss his work in independent films julia stiles proves again why she's so damn likable of course she's a very beautiful girl with a radiant smile that makes me want to faint but she also possesses a unique charm and seems to have good personality in other words her beauty shows inside and out i don't know the actresses' name but the woman who plays the drunk granny is hilarious julie hagerty also has a small part and she's always enjoyable to watch which makes me wish she received better roles i loved her so much in airplane and lost in america that it's a shame she doesn't get the same opportunities to flaunt her skills br br don't be put off by the horrible trailers and even more horrible box office records this is a funny charming film romantic comedies are getting so predictable nowadays that it feels like the genre itself is ready to be flushed down the toilet so it's always to see a good one among all these bad apples br br my score 7 out of 10
homeward bound is a beautiful film y'know the part where shadow falls down the ditch thingy i cried considering i was only six i cried it takes a lot to make me cry the dogs and the cat are excellently trained a nice family movie not for completely hardened non fluffy people or animal haters but could for soft as crap a k a people like me br br a good film overall 10 10
personnaly i really loved this movie and it particularly moved me the two main actors are giving us such great performances that at the end it is really heart breaking to know what finally happened to their characters br br the alchemy between barbra streisand and kris kristofferson is marvelous and the song are just great the way they are br br that's why i didn't feel surprised when i learned it had won 5 golden globe awards the most rewarded movie at the golden globes an oscar and even a grammy this movie is a classic that deserves to be seen by anyone a great movie that has often been criticized maybe because streisand dared to get involved in it surely as a co director her artistry is the biggest and that will surely please you
i just saw valentine and i have to say that it was the best slasher movie that i've seen in years unlike the recent trend of 90's horror flicks this movie is more concerned with being eerie than it is with being self mocking for those out there that hated scream there is not one reference to the horror rules in this movie even though the old slasher movie rules do apply here br br this is the perfect blend of 80's and 90's horror you get the style cinematography and good acting of 90's films and the stalking slasher madness of an 80's flick i guess the year 2001 is going to finally give horror fans the kind of movies they were longing for this is definitely a move in the right direction br br denise richards stands out here as a fun character you can tell she liked her role and that makes her stand out i loved her in this movie
if there's one thing that annoys me most in seeing a bad film it's seeing it done by experienced film makers who ought to know better this re imagining of planet of the apes could have used some imagination to say nothing of essential elements of character development nova the girl in the original planet of the apes was a better developed character than daena in this version for all that she does not say a single word one certainly expected a lot better from tim burton a man who has hitherto combined an incredible visual imagination with intelligence wit and humour all of which were notably absent from this production br br there were problems in basic plot development the first big mistake was allowing the humans to talk this was the fundamental difference between apes and men that made all the difference in the original film even while he was mute his ability to communicate was what marked out heston's taylor as being different from the other humans in the current film mark wahlberg encourages the talking human slaves to revolt but there is no overpowering reason for them to have not revolted and reclaimed their emancipation already they are dexterous tool users and have the ability to communicate in order to form plans something mute humans can't do it needs no man to fall from the stars to save them indeed since he comes from a technological civilisation and finds himself in a pre technology era without at first any gadgets to help him it is wahlberg who ought to be at a disadvantage not the humans who are used to living there br br it was sad to see helena bonham carter working so hard to generate some kind of spark between herself and that unresponsive brick wall mark wahlberg her best scenes were with the villainous tim roth br br the humans were practically ignored until they were needed in the third act at which point daena started showing some actual interest in davidson wahlberg and a young boy suddenly changed from part of the background to a feisty gung ho freedom fighter this was poor character development estella warren in particular looked as if she would have been capable of a great deal more than she was given in the script wahlberg's puzzlement at the end as to what these humans see in him was certainly shared by me as he has scarcely interacted with the humans throughout br br creating the apes half a plus point and two minuses ape make up was excellent on the males particularly michael clarke duncan who has incredibly expressive eyes which was why he was so good in the green mile and the makeup design allowed him to use them fully but the ape females looked like nothing on earth neither ape nor human the minuses were the ape jumps which looked about as realistic as flash gordon's rocket jumping apes looked as if they'd just been fired from a catapult they had none of the long limbed grace of genuine apes secondly the poor sound mixing when the gorillas roar it is quite clearly dubbed from some animal probably feline making them sound ridiculous and unrealistic br br in the original film the various human things the apes do and say are handled as light relief i never knew an ape i didn't like human see human do here the apes just talk matter of factly exactly as 21st century humans do and there is no humour in it at all the only genuinely original idea was ari writing with her feet br br nothing made me cringe more than the v ger from star trek moment near the end of the film first of all the apes had apparently been able to read roman lettering in the distant past for them to know the name of the forbidden zone in its partly concealed form secondly the mysterious inscription giving the name is merely covered with sand which wahlberg just brushes away something any ape could have done centuries ago this moment was for me far worse than the much maligned ending of the movie br br things of that nature however are typical of most science fiction movies of today back in the '60s and '70s they generally didn't have the budget to make convincing futuristic sets but they dealt with genuinely original themes and ideas which were truly science fictional i'm thinking of 2001 a space odyssey the 1967 planet of the apes thx1138 soylent green silent running and the 1972 solaris the first planet of the apes even utilised the only scientifically valid and physically possible method of travelling forward in time however this film includes just about every bad science fiction cliché going space storms anomalies and worm holes straight out of star trek the planets of the solar system and their moons apparently all visible together as large globes in reality from any one planet all other bodies even their own moons are just points of light a conventional rocket powered shuttle travelling from saturn to earth in a matter of minutes instead of years two thousand year old equipment firing up and fully working the minute the hero presses the button to say nothing of a conveniently bulletproof internal glass door in a contemporary setting you'd have to explain why it was bullet proof but because it's science fiction you don't have to br br overall burton's most disappointing film
antitrust could have been a great vehicle for rachael leigh cook but the director cut out her best scenes in the scenes that she are in she is just a zombie she is involved in a sub plot that is simular to a sub plot in get carter but she handles the sub plot better in get carter i blame the director the director's homage to hitchcock was corny it's the scene were ryan philippe's charactor realizes he may not be able to trust tim robbin's charactor at least i think it's a homage to hitchcock the dvd shows the scenes that were cut out i think the director should have trust his instincts and not listen to the test audiences
dave is going through a divorce and his mind wanders back to his first love wanders is probably not the word i should say he fixates on the past girlfriend he recalls to the day when the relationship ended the dream sequences only lack the hazy transitions he fondly recalls their favorite songs and places they went i'm not a counselor but maybe this had something to do with the failed marriage dave goes to a support group and meets up with a lady half his age also divorced who instead of being turned off by his creepiness starts to become interested in him did i mention how creepy dave is he sometimes refers to himself in the third person he doesn't move his arms when he walks either it's just weird too make a long story short dave plots to hunt down mary the old gal friend and kill her err i mean confront her he does so which was really creepy he believes her to be married yet he still flies half way across the country to meet her he stakes out her house to make sure she is alone before he drops in on her he has an awkward conversation with her that ends with his sharing the gospel of christ in about 10 words or less and flies back to the new young girlfriend we enjoyed the movie mostly for unintentional comedic value i am still entertaining the wife with my dave impressions i heard another dave mary song
there's so many things to fall for in aro tolbukhin en la mente del asesino inside the killer's mind that it's very hard to talk about it without giving any kind of warning let's just say that this movie is like an exercise in cinema but really really great done it´s made with super 8 black and white shots 35 milimeters color interviews flashbacks aro tolbukhin it´s like a movie made a documental or viceversa which most peculiar aspect relays on the doubt that leaves you wondering did he really ever existed the movie follows the later life of an hungarian sailor that arrived in guatemala worked in a religious mission and then killed some people an act for which he got caught and death penalty sentenced the movie starts because some french documentalists got interested in this character so they interview him prior to his death nowadays some more people got involved and make a deeper research of the character the one we are witness of the movie br br for the main part in the history we are guided by a semi slow phase to go look inside aro´s mind mainly in order to decode why he did what he has done nevertheless the important thing is that the filmmakers never gives us a sided point of view they left the judging for all of us and even as we may understand his actions we clearly never justify them so the first half is based upon recollecting information later things turn into aro's childhood giving the movie such an incredible new force even tough never got weak or boring br br i don't mean and don't want to spoil anything so the only thing left to say is that if by any chance you get this movie near you believe me the trip to see it is more than worthy
i put this movie on in the hotel room to entertain my children the morning we were leaving to go home because i had packed away all their toys toddlers don't like to watch regis and kathie lee or the view my four year old found one scene funny but told me the rest of it was too silly this is a four year old folks anyone over the age of say nine will want to kill their television rather than let this one play itself out br br to say this movie is bad is like saying the holocaust was a little mistake there are no words for how ridiculous and utterly terrible this film truly is the acting is bad the plot is stupid and the script is pathetically unfunny since this is supposed to be a comedy the fact that you cannot even laugh at the badness of the movie makes it even worse bronson balki pinchot is the worst with some weird fake accent irish pakistani bronx cockney cajun as far as i could tell but all the characters are awful i haven't watched a real laurel and hardy film in ages but i know that they had to be way better than this what is the point of ruining a classic comic duo with this br br bottom line derivative garbage avoid at all costs unless you have some freaky bronson pinchot fetish 2 10
as a physics student i've become aware of many idiot professors and other so called experts in the field as i continue with my studies i learn more and more about real physics experiments going on and about the people who are doing things right br br then my friends tell me of this physics movie they want to see knowing nothing of it i'm excited hoping that the information will be presented well br br i've done real quantum mechanics this wasn't it br br this movie starts with the basic assumption that anything that occurs to a subatomic particle can and will occur to you if you just open your eyes let's think about that for just a moment br br our bodies are composed of somewhere around 10 30 such subatomic particles that is a million billion billion billion particles the more mysterious quantum effects of just two particles can have a 50 probability of cancelling each other out completely as you add more and more particles into the mix it becomes almost impossible to have a large net quantum result to tell us to believe that this is a valid assumption with no rationality behind it it's just stupid br br my friend also in physics and i counted 3 facts during the course of this movie but they were presented in the most misleading manner i've ever seen br br i cannot say as much for the neural portion of the movie as i have not had any kind of medical training it seemed as though it might have had a slight bit more truth to it remembering my days in biology but i cannot say br br at least this film had a redeeming quality the dancing peptides or whatever they actually were scene not to ruin the invaluable plot that drives this movie but the main character goes to a wedding where she sees all different types of personalities driven by their peptides and then the film cuts to the dance floor where we are spliced between people dancing sometimes surrounded by cg peptides and a fully cg scene filled with dancing peptides the film at that point was trying to tell us how we're addicted to emotions so we're treated to the full song of that smash hit addicted to love br br this scene was redeeming because anyone who could go through that scene and still take this movie seriously well you are the ones that need to open your eyes
i first saw this movie on some movie channel hbo some time ago i was a fan of public enemy nwa and other early rap and had seen cb4 in theaters anyway the promo for it caught my eye and i wanted to see what it was all about well right off the bat i knew it was going to be good warning and i was right the parody songs alone make this movie worth watching over and over my peanuts but the overall flow and delivery of the movie was great you've got to love the satire of rap groups obviously nwa certain rappers eazy e flava flav ice cube and the humor of the three members of nwh who can forget tone deaf scratching with his ass it's too bad this movie didn't get the credit it deserved as it was overshadowed by cb4 during their releases but in my opinion is a much better film if you know and like 90's 'gangster' rap you'll be watching and laughing with this movie for a long time if you aren't into or don't like 'rap' you'll enjoy the jokes at the expense of the genre
okay i'll confess this is the movie that made me love what michael keaton could do he does a beautiful parody of someone doing a parody of james cagney with charm to spare br br the supporting cast are solid workers all and will step right up and do a fine job in this '80s comedy a spoof of the '30s '40s gangster movies it breaks new ground constantly with remarkably original material well yeah some of it has been copied since but when this movie was made it was original and much of it has not been copied elsewhere watch joe piscopo warn people to not do with one of the great taglines of spoofs watch roman moronie do things with english profanity that would make your spinster grammar teacher laugh watch amazing sight gags such as pet store owner johnny kelly using the price tag gun on his puppies and dusting his kittens watch the greatest warning against sex educational film ever made watch the most amazing misrepresentation of church latin done while a guy who never took shop class assembles a thompson machine gun from parts watch lines you'll be using in casual conversation for the next decade watch maureen stapleton do the perfect antithesis to the hard working mom with surprise gags that you'll never see coming br br if you see a gag that doesn't hit your funny bone be patient another will come along in 30 seconds or less and the odds are you'll need to pause until you're done rolling on the floor several times duckies and bunnies them too watch for the subtle stuff some of the sight gags can go by unnoticed the first few viewings br br there are a few minor flaws but it's probably the best of the spoofs some come close but none of them are quite this good
i always found betsy drake rather creepy and this movie reinforces that as another review said this is a stalker movie that isn't very funny i watched it because it has cg in it but he hardly gets any screen time it's no north by northwest
well you might not actually see any women in love in this movie but you'll certainly hear women talking about love and men talking about love and women talking about men and men talking about women and men talking about men and everyone talking about death and talking and talking until you yourself will want to scream and do something that requires no talking at all like paint your bedroom or water your plants br br welcome to the world of d h lawrence where psycho babble reigns supreme and where no one can get down to living a productive life because everyone is too busy talking about how unproductive their lives are spending time with the characters in a d h lawrence novel is like being locked in a closet with a group of your most self absorbed acquaintances who you would run away from if you met them at a party when i read women in love i so desperately wanted to strangle every single character in it but since i couldn't i was hoping they would at least strangle each other alas only one of them dies not by strangulation and i won't spoil it for you by telling which one in case you actually give a damn about this story or any of these people br br to give director ken russell his due he makes this filmed version about as entertaining as it's possible to make this essentially unfilmable novel he throws out much of the psychological mumbo jumbo that lawrence adored and focuses instead on all of the naughty parts so we get lots of histrionic lovemaking in beds and fields two buck naked men wrestling by firelight and one embarrassing scene featuring alan bates yup buck naked again roaming around in a meadow making love to bushes and grass i'm not kidding glenda jackson won an oscar for her performance as gudrun the more dominant of the two sisters at the story's focus and she certainly tries her hardest to do something with this material anyone would deserve an oscar simply for having to bear russell's decision to give her a scene where she has to dance wildly in front of a herd of mystified looking cattle oliver reed has one expression an intense glower the whole thing is over written and over directed and it's deliriously campy indeed this vies with mommie dearest as perhaps the most unintentionally hysterical movie i've ever seen br br grade d
if you're after the real story of early baroque painter artemisia gentileschi you'll be disappointed however if you're after a reasonably crafted bodice ripper with an art theme you've found you're movie br br this film is such a foundationally inaccurate depiction of artemisia gentileschi's life that it almost made me weep type in artemisia inaccuracies in google and check out some of the fact vs fiction articles from a purely technical point of view though the film was alright the sets costumes and especially the chiaroscuro lighting helped create an immersive early 17th century experience although the above mentioned glaring factual inaccuracies let it down a bit br br i wonder how the director co writer agnès merlet defended her film at the time perhaps she refused to portray artemisia as a victim which would've been unfortunate because lets face it she was
with rapid intercutting of scenes of insane people in an asylum and montage superimposition of images and vague interwoven narratives this is a very hard movie to follow apparently a man masue inoue takes a job as a porter or janitor in an asylum so he can be near his imprisoned wife and maybe to rescue her but she's clearly mad huddled on the floor with a vacant expression much of the time and fear misery and confusion written on her face the rest of the time the film maker switches to her point of view sometimes and we see vague images of her at the side of a pond drowning a baby or clutching at a drowned child she's tormented by something when the point of view shifts to her or other mad folks the filmmaker uses distorting lenses and such things showing us what mad people see and then how they react and the place is swarming with mad folks laughing hiding and in one case dancing frenetically night and day at one point the man tries to take his wife outside but the night outside the door terrifies her and she runs back to her cell gradually the man slips into a nightmare in which he's interrupted in another attempt to steal her away and he kills the doctor and many attendants and all the while the mad folk laugh and applaud when he wakes he is relieved and mops the floor some fascinating shots of japanes life streets buildings in the 1920s
a lot of people unfairly sh t on this series but several of the guinea pig videos are fairly entertaining devil's experiment in particular has some really fantastic effects work not just the infamous eyeball scene but also a very realistic skin slice on the foot and a hand breaking with a sledgehammer are very realistic especially for the video's vintage and low budget br br let me start at the beginning now for those who don't know this film is an extreme torture fake snuff film that surfaced in japan in the mid 80s it's plot as it stands is simple a young girl is held by a few men and forced to undergo a series of brutal tortures to see where her breaking point is this entails brutal violence all effectively realistic effects including the ones mentioned in the last paragraph as well as a painful looking application of hot oil to the captive girl's arm and placing of maggots in the subsequent flaky wound br br the least effective sequences are at the very beginning of the video and consist of an unconvincing slap session where three men take turns slapping the hell out of the girl as her head falls about and a second sequence where the three men take turns kicking the girl and pushing her to the ground these two scenes are obviously staged and detract from the realism of the rest of the proceedings br br the actress who plays the victim of the experiment is pretty convincing at being in pain and takes a good amount of abuse and rough stuff on camera her reactions as she has headphones strapped to her head and loud noises are played for hours on end are chilling some of the other abuse she takes is being strung up in a net from a tree during the only times she is given a rest also there is a disturbing scene where the giggling captors through guts at her and one other disgustingly sleazy scene where she is spun in an office chair and forced to drink a bottle of jack daniels till she pukes br br if you haven't seen this series i hope i have helped you decide whether or not you want to give this episode a shot 8 5 10 for devil's experiment
i laughed so hard during this movie my face hurt ben affleck was hilarious and reminded me of a pretty boy jack black in this role gandolfini gives his typical a performance the entire cast is funny the story pretty good and the comic moments awesome i went into this movie not expecting much so perhaps that is why i was so surprised to come out of the flick thoroughly pleased and facially exhausted i would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys comedy can identify with loneliness during the holidays and or putting up with the relatives the best part to this film to me anyway were the subtle bits of humor that caught me completely off guard and had me laughing long after the rest of the audience had stopped namely the scene involving the lighting of the christmas tree go see it and have a good laugh
a dying kung fu master sends out his last student in order to track down what happened to the previous five students who were members of the banned poison clan he is to see if they are acting for good and if not he his to stop them the master also wants the student to find another member of the clan who ran off with the clans money which the master wants used for good the earlier students were all taught in a different style snake centipede scorpion lizard toad while the last student was taught a little in each style all of the students end up in one town looking for the old man with all of the money and soon everyone is battling to get the money br br classic martial arts film has title that even many non fans know i've spoken with a couple of casual fans and this seems to be the one film that sticks in their head its a very good movie though i'm not really sure why this film stays with people when for my money there are other films that are better from the shaw studio one armed swordmen or the brave archer series for example this isn't to sell the film short its not since the film is structured like a mystery our hero has no clue who anyone is and the venoms themselves only know at best who two of the others is we're given the identity of four but we still have to work out who the fifth really is the film is also odd in that for a martial arts film other than a training sequence at the start and the killing of the old man and his family for the money there is really no action for about 40 or 45 minutes its a bold move to do it but it pays off since the plot and the performances hold your attention the film is also odd in that its the first martial arts film i think i've ever seen where there are no women i don't think one has a speaking role and i'm pretty sure that none appear in the background its indicative of nothing its just something that struck me this is a good solid little film that may not live up to the reputation it has in some circles but is still a really good film to curl up with on your couch br br around 7 out of 10
because 'cruel' would be the only word in existence to describe the intentions of these film makers where do you even begin in a spout of b tchiness i'm going to start with the awful acting of nearly everybody in this movie scratch that nearly does not belong in that sentence i can't think of even one character who was portrayed well although in all fairness it would be nearly impossible to portray these zero dimensional characters in a successful way still the girl who played katherine whose name i purposefully don't include i'm pretending she doesn't exist remains one of the worst actors i've ever seen only eclipsed by the guy who played sebastian the story was god awful it attempted to mirror the brilliance that was the first one but failed in so many ways pretty much every part of it was pointless though i will admit grudgingly that the plot twist was quite good it its surprise and the ending was at least slightly humorous but this film is up there with the worst i've seen don't watch it just don't there is absolutely no value in watching it none it only takes away the enjoyment of the first
for the life of me i can't understand the good reviews on this piece of crap it was pointless matthew modine was horribly miscast as a leading ladies man gina gershon well others have said it but i'll reiterate why the stupid accent totally unnecessary and her acting was just bad i don't know if she was thrown by the accent or what there was no chemistry between these two br br and the girl modine was in love with suddenly she's shoving half a head of lettuce in her mouth and acting in a goofy way where did that come from i think we were supposed to feel sorry for her as we saw her marriage to a workaholic begin to crumble but frankly i couldn't care less about any of these people
worse than the rating it has been given this is a typical scifi movie nowadays bad to awful acting a script that is poorly written and shoddy direction from the opening scene where demille is burying his set to the end this movie is terrible in the beginning scenes this movie has moses which was charlton heston in the demille film pharoah yul brynner and nefretiri anne baxtor overlooking a boy burying a box in the sand the characters that were to represent the three aforementioned icons were awful and had to resemblance to the people they were to supposedly be the fact that this is in the desert away from civilization is hilarious when someone is hurt and they are all yelling for an ambulance the screenwriter obviously is oblivious to the fact that there are no ambulances in the middle of the desert i was sorely disappointed that morena baccarin decided to do a film of such low quality
remember ralph bakshi the guy that was an animator on terrytoons then on paramount cartoon studios after that he was a director on fritz the cat 1 2 and heavy traffic well this is coonskin and it's actually pretty good racist but good the movie takes place in harlem nights no duh it was a working title but with a twist that becomes a lampoon of a disney movie song of the south br br it's about sampson barry white and the preacherman charles gordone rush to help their friend randy philip michael thomas escape from prison but are stopped by a roadblock and wind up in a shootout with the police while waiting for them randy unwillingly listens to fellow escapee pappy scatman crothers as he begins to tell randy a story about three guys i used to know just like you and your friends pappy's story is told in animation set against live action background photos and footage br br brother rabbit voice of thomas brother bear voice of white and preacher fox voice of gordone decide to pack up and leave their southern settings after the bank mortgages their home and sells it to a man who turns it into a brothel arriving in harlem rabbit bear and fox find that it isn't all that it's made out to be they encounter a con man named simple savior a phony revolutionary leader who purports to be the cousin of black jesus and that he gives his followers the strength to kill whites in a flashy stage performance in his church savior acts out being brutalized by symbols of black oppressionrepresented by images of john wayne elvis presley and richard nixon before asking his parishioners for donations br br rabbit first goes up against madigan a virulently racist and homophobic white police officer and the bag man for the mafia who demonstrates his contempt for african americans in various ways including a refusal to bathe before an anticipated encounter with them he believes they're not worth it when madigan finds out that rabbit has been taking his payoffs he and his cohorts ruby and bobby are led to a nightclub called the cottontail br br a black stripper distracts him while an lsd sugar cube is dropped into his drink madigan while under the influence of his spiked drink is then maneuvered into a sexual liaison with a stereotypically effeminate gay man and then shoved into clothes that women were representative of the racist archetype adorned in something racist and finally shoved out the back of the club where he discovers that ruby and bobby are dead br br then while recovering from his delirium of being drugged shoots his gun around randomly and is shot to death by the police after shooting one of them br br rabbit bear fox and the opponent boxer rush out of the boxing arena as it blows up the live action story ends with randy and pappy escaping while being shot at by various white cops but managing to make it out alive br br this movie was controversial at that time of release and was re edited by the director several times under the title street fight which is obvious since street fight is a 2005 documentary about racism in the streets in fact this movie has the same subject as the documentary br br that caused bryanston pictures the distributor of this film and the original tobe hopper classic texas chainsaw massacre to go out of business because paramount wanted to produce and distribute this film but due to racism bryanston took over bakshi's production br br despite the controversy it was worth the entertainment the animation was awesome at that time the plot makes sense and it's actually funny too br br final verdict 9 10
i had never heard of this film prior to seeing it i wondered if it was an independent film and i was correct but with a good cast i decided to chance it basically drifter michael williams nicolas cage is in the town red rock wyoming looking for a job and meeting bar owner wayne brown pleasantville's j t walsh he is given a large sum of money mistaken for a hit man he has hired to kill his unfaithful wife suzanne lara flynn boyle he does not correct him takes the money and goes to warn suzanne and after she makes him a counteroffer he decides he needs to leave when wayne knows his real identity he chases michael shooting a big gun until he gets in a car with lyle from dallas dennis hopper but things get complicated when michael realises lyle is the hit man he was mistaken for and he makes a quick retreat he goes back to suzanne and knowing they are both in danger they plan to leave town together and add another complication by falling for each other before they leave however suzanne insists they go and steal a big amount money in the safe of course things aren't going to go smoothly and wayne and lyle catch up to them and lyle forces them and now tied up wayne to go and get the buried money in the end lyle and wayne both get what they deserve michael and suzanne do get on a moving train together but it is obvious she cares more about the money and she gets what she deserves too also starring craig reay as jim vance johnson as mr johnson timothy carhart as deputy matt greytack dwight yoakam as truck driver and robert apel as howard the performances apart from maybe a lame boyle are all fine and dandy and it has got quite a good film noir feel for a black comedy thriller very good

two years ago on berlin film festival we watched the amos kollek movie sue in the panorama program with a wonderful anna thomson in the leading part it's a film about loneliness and sex and how the one thing is compensated by the other in the same section on the festival now we have to complain the superfluous antithesis of sue extension du domaine de la lutte which now tries to convince us that loneliness and having no sex is one and the same problem but unfortunately we can't sympathize with our hero how he is called by the story teller because he is unnecessarily and incomprehensibly tired of company and himself own fault i'm sorry i can't understand him not enough the writer director actor want us admitting to him that it's not his destroyed self consciousness or the passivity of his personality what brought him so far but the rotten society and its image of sexuality yes there are some deeper insights about gender relations but we won't follow him so far and the point is that there is rather any sign of reflection about his own portion to the fate having no sex who didn't notice yet it's a quite depressing film br br in the beginning there had been some starts to be more accurate in sketching the situation at the bed store the hero speaks about the hindrances buying a new bed perhaps it's too broad getting up the stairs you have to stay at home half a day this is a satire about a character who doesn't know taking the life and heart in hands doing something the movie doesn t follow this path but handles his characters with helplessness nobody believes that our hero is able to instigate tisserand for a murder too dull too kind too passive not to mention tisserand's complex he has an inhibition but he couldn't be of course a murderer of women to finish there are women and the world it's not a device of a modern sexualized society help you as you can but don't follow the messages and the wisdom of this movie which announces bankruptcy to human relationships without seizing the real conflicts within
i'll tell you a tale of the summer of 1994 a friend and i attended a canada day concert in barrie and it was a who's who of the top canadian bands of the age we got there about 4am waited in line most of the morning and when the doors opened at 9am we were among the first inside the gates we then waited and waited in the hot sun slowly broiling but we didn't care because the headliners were among our favourites at one point early in the afternoon i sat down and dozed off with my back to the barrier i was awakened to my shock and dismay by a shrieking girl wearing a rheostatics t shirt this is the reason i have hated the rheostatics to this day there's nothing reasonable nor taste determined nor really anything except their fandom snotty of me isn't it so i in my hatred of the band have denied myself the delight that is whale music br br desmond howl had it all it's hard to say what he's lost since he lives in a fantastic mansion wedged between the ocean and the mountains the bc region where the movie was shot is breathtaking the life most of us dream of is dismantled by dreams phantoms and his own past until the day a teenaged criminal breaks in and trite as it sounds breaks him out br br canadian cinema suffers from several problems generally a lack of money as well as an insufferable lack of asking for help as if somehow the feature would cease to be canadian leads to lower production values than american or british films and most people don't like to watch anything that sounds or looks like well not like an american film next canadian screenwriters often seem so caught up in being weird that they lose sight of how to tell a good story and tell it well third they seem to think that gratuitous nudity often full frontal makes something artistic i'm sure anyone who watches enough canadian movies especially late at night on the cbc knows exactly what i'm talking about it's almost like a don't do this handbook exists out there somewhere and canadian film makers threw it out a long time ago br br in the 90s and 00s however some films such as bruce mcdonald's work and the brilliant c r a z y have broken this mold and managed to maintain what makes them canadian while holding onto watchable production values and great stories whale music is such a film on the surface deeper than just its canadian isms it's a deeply moving story of a man who's lost his grip through grief and excess who is redeemed by music then by love and that redeems even the rheostatics
i do agree with everything calamine has said and i don't always agree with people but what calamine has said is very true it is time for the girls to move on to better roles i would like to see them succeed very much as they were a very inspirational pair growing up and i would like to see them grow as people actresses and in their career as well as their personal life so producers please give the girls a chance to develop something that goes off the tangent a bit move them into a new direction that recognises them individually and their talents in many facets this movie that is being commented is not too bad but as i have seen further on in their movies their movies stay the same of typical plot and typography when in rome is good for audiences of younger generation but the adults who were kids when the twins were babies want to follow the twins in their successes and so hence i think we adults would like to see them make movies of different kinds maybe some that are like the sixth sense the hour chocolat that sort of movie not saying to have just serious movies for them humour ones too yes but rather see them in different roles to what they have been playing in their more recent movies like this one and new york minute note i am from australia so excuse my weird spelling like reognise with the s instead of z
i saw it last night on tv and was quite delighted br br it is sort of the movie which makes you feel nice and warm around heart and believe that there is still some goodness in the world all the neighbours pretended not to see what grace was doing in order to help her and protect her the old policeman is my favourite although you know that this story is not quite realistic br br i loved acting they all seemed just as ordinary common people living in small picturesque english coast town but the greatest thing in the movie was the wit and humor it has just remember the scene in the shop with two old ladies after they had their tea br br perhaps the ending was a little bit confusing but it didn't stop me from really really enjoying the whole story
when i go out to the video store to rent a flick i usually trust imdb's views on a film and until this one had never seen a flick rated 7 0 or above on the site i did not enjoy br br sidney lumet a legendary director of some of the best films of the 20th century really misstepped here by making one of the biggest mistakes a filmmaker can filling a film's cast with thoroughly unlikeable characters with no real redeeming qualities whatsoever br br i like films with flawed characters but no matter how dark someone's personality is we all have a bit of light in there too we're all shades of gray with some darker or brighter than others mr lumet crossed this line by filling this movie with totally unsympathetic and almost masochistic pitch black characters br br ethan hawke's hank is a 30 something whining immature irresponsible man child divorced from a marriage with a wife that hates him and a daughter who thinks he's a loser which he very much is his indecisiveness and willingness to let others do the dirty work for him because he's too cowardly to do it himself leads directly to their bank robbery plan falling apart and mother getting killed by the time he stands up to his older brother at the end of the film it's more pathetic than uplifting ethan hawke plays his character well but isn't given much to work with as he is portrayed as someone with a boot perpetually stamped on their face and he doesn't' particularly care that it's there br br speaking of which his character's wife is equally as bad just about every single shot of the film she's in is her verbally berating him for rent and child support money and further grinding in his already non existent self esteem with insults seriously that's just about all the character does her harpy like behavior borders on malevolent br br albert finney plays their father charles and while mr finney has been a great actor for many decades he spends about 90 of this film with the same mouth open half grimace on his face like he's suffering from the world's worst bout of constipation for someone who's been an actor as long as mr finney you think he'd be more apt at emoting even though he doesn't show it much his character is supposedly grief stricken and anger filled and when he smothers andy at the film's conclusion it's akin to dr frankenstein putting the monster he helped create out of it's own misery br br marisa tomei isn't given much to do with her character stuck in an unhappy marriage with andy and having an affair with his brother for some unfathomable reason when andy's world begins to spiral out of control she logically jumps ship but it really doesn't make her any less selfish or self serving than any other character in the film but probably the one with the most common sense at least br br and finally we come to andy played by the always good philip seymour hoffman is the only reason i rated this film a 3 instead of a 1 his performance of the heroin addicted embezzling financial executive who's perfect crime of robbing his parent's insured jewelry store goes awry is mesmerizing his descent from calm master planner of a flawed scheme to unstable deranged homicidal maniac is believable and tragic hoffman's character ends up being the film's chief villain but it's hard to root against him given the alternatives are an emotionally castrated little brother and a father who's self admitted poor early parenting led to his son's eventual psychosis and indirect unintentional murder of his mother br br ultimately this film is really only worth watching for psh's great performance and it's family train wreck nature just don't expect there to be any characters worth cheering for because there really aren't
this movie was boring br br yes there are a few funny moments and jokes but you cannot base a whole movie on that br br the characters are too stereotyped there is no real story but short episodes with freaky side characters who are not freaky enough to make the plot genuine br br shame because most of the actors are acknowledged in hungary a mystery why they took the roles br br this is not a new hope for the hungarian film it was boring though it was meant to be genuine or unique they could have tried much more harder than this 2 out of 10
i can't remember many films where a bumbling idiot of a hero was so funny throughout leslie cheung is such the antithesis of a hero that he's too dense to be seduced by a gorgeous vampire i had the good luck to see it on a big screen and to find a video to watch again and again 9 10

i have watched this movie a few times and never really thought it was that funny but it's still fun to watch and good for a few laughs br br its about women that work at a company and their boss is a jerk and they end up giving him a taste of his own medicine and try to get the respect they deserve br br the acting is really good dabney coleman is one of those 80's stars that plays a good bad guy not really evil just unlikeable dolly partin is lovable and fun to watch in comedies and her down south wit really shines here jane fonda is so so and does little for me lily tomlin is the best thing about this movie she has the funniest lines and made me laugh out loud several times gotta love her br br i could recommend this to anyone that likes 80's comedy i like the movie but it has things about it that i don't like it starts off great and has a nice flow and then everything starts coming together all at once and made me care less about the characters they all have little fantasies about what they would like to do the boss and although 'cute' i just thought it slowed down the flow of the movie as the movie goes on it once again picks up and the funniest things happen and then once again it slows down only to wrap up in a quick manner thats too good to be true br br 4 out of 10 stars but give it a try if you haven't seen it i think depending on ones mood it may be more or less likable
this movie is a muddled mish mash of clichés from recent cinema there are some promising ideas in there but while the director was clearly aiming to wind up with a hauntingly ambiguous film what he ended up with was a confusing mess lead actor daniel wu does a fair job but with no central theme it seems as though he doesn't have much to work with furthermore the movie is largely devoid of scares although in fairness there are some creepy moments amid the drudgery br br mild spoilers br br we have the mysterious death of an estranged twin diabolical librarians ghostly love interests identity confusion death by savage monkeys oedipal conflict abusive stepfathers sublimated homosexuality and crime gang connections the only real commonality these elements share seems to be that they cause the protagonist to express a vague sense of confusion and discontent br br perhaps the most disappointing aspect to this film is that despite the brother's death by monkeys being strongly featured on the dvd cover the act itself is never directly portrayed instead director julian lee uses what appears to be stock footage of monkeys not very scary br br end spoilers br br avoid this one for an excellent psychological ambiguous horror tale check out the korean film a tale of two sisters 2003
this movie was terrible throughout the whole movie i was puzzled and did not see any point to it i had to go to this site and read the review to finally understand what it was about this movie is not worth watching at all not only is it sick and revolting but totally stupid please don't watch unless you are one of those that likes to watch bad movies if this movie questions japanese society and their values and roles than this is a country that i would not like to visit or bother to know this is a totally sick movie i did not enjoy it because it made no sense my boyfriend and i sat there waiting to see if it was a horror because that is what it was listed under it was total disappointment
hollywood's attempt to turn jack london's life into a jack london adventure film isn't a bad idea certainly he led an interesting and sometimes adventurous life this film however winds up flat and unsatisfying most importantly it lacks integrity michael o'shea as london has some londonesque speeches and it's nice to see his bearded jack receive the call of the wild after spending some quality time alone in the snowy mountains with his dog buck virginia mayo and susan hayward are both very pretty the film draws unfortunate yellow peril parallels between london's life and world war ii which are both strained and insulting br br jack london 11 24 43 alfred santell michael o'shea susan hayward virginia mayo
i didn't know what to expect from the film well now i know this was a truly awful film the screenplay directing and acting were equally bad the story was silly and stupid the director could have made a smart and thought provoking film but he didn't i squirmed in my seat for the last half of the movie because it was so bad where was the focus to the film where was anything in this film christians should boycott this film instead of promoting it it was shabbily done and a waste of my money do not see this film
this is easily the worst ridley scott film ridley scott is a wonderful director but this film is a black mark on his career demi moore and viggo mortensen both totally miscast in an overaggressive film about a girl going to the army very stupid and there is never one scene that is convincing in any way it is really not difficult to make a film such as this everything the crew makes could have been an idea of just anybody the writers didn't have much inspiration either many foolish dialogs that made no sense at all and some brainless action i strongly recommend to stay away from this rubbish i hope that the many talented persons involved in this project realize this type of film does not deserve their attention and that in the future they will work on more honorable and more intelligent movies than this useless mess
do not see this movie if you value your mind at the end of our collective viewing me and my friends estimated that we each lost 5 of our brains during its course the only person involved with its making that was not clinically insane was the set designer br br most movies leave a bad taste in your mouth i realize now that instead of a feeling of revulsion this movie has bred a deep hatred within me i hate this movie so very very much br br some might say this movie is not meant to be taken seriously if only it didn't take itself seriously but it does the plot is a warmed over version of blade runner esque universe melded with the cheap rubber suits so prevalent in bad dinosaur movies the dialogue is not only puerile and meaningless but often literally painful whoopee goldberg isn't even trying but george newbern as the voice of theodore rex is like fingernails on the soul and whether its juliet landua with her off again on again british accent or richard roundtree aka shaft as the blustering commissioner you will sink into an ever increasing sense of incredulity and disillusionment br br i recommend this movie only to anyone who wishes to see the depths of stupidity to which mankind may fall
this comedy with much underlying pain and sadness succeeds where most others fail there have been many films of this genre with more notable actors attempting to achieve this elusive mixture which haven't come anywhere near the depth and deftness of this one this is surely because the exceptional cast with outstanding performances by reg rogers and ally sheedy seem so spontaneous that the reality of their characters rapidly grip your interest and emotions and hold them throughout the film at first the action seems rather off the wall and harebrained but one gradually learns that these two rather pathetic damaged people are desperately and unwillingly trying to heal themselves even if grudgingly through each other rogers' heartrending facial expressions of numb hurt and sheedy's angry outbursts are so eloquent that one feels them as one observes them you will care about these two likable but deeply suffering people and hope that they will succeed because it's in doubt and all hangs on a tenuous emotional thread hopefully audiences will get to see more of reg rogers and ally sheedy as this film proves their merit as very accomplished actors beyond doubt
this adaptation like 1949's the heiress is based on the henry james novel the heiress starring olivia de havilland remains as a well respected piece of work though less true to james' original story than this new remake which retains james' original title it is the story of a awkward yet loving daughter leigh devoted to her father finney after her mother dies during childbirth the arrogant father holds his daughter in no esteem whatsoever and considers her as well as all women simpleminded when a young man chaplin of good family and little fortune comes courting the father is naturally suspicious but feeling so sure that his daughter could hold no interest for any man is convinced that the young man is a fortune hunter and forbids her to see him leigh is a controversial actress  most either love her or hate her  and she always has a particular edginess and tenseness to her style like she's acting through gritted teeth she's not bad in this and she handles her role relatively deftly  it's just an awkward role for any actress making the audience want to grab the character by her shoulders and shake her until she comes to her senses while the character garners a lot of sympathy she's not particularly likable the very handsome and immensely appealing ben chaplin previously seen in the truth about cats and dogs plays his role with the exact amount of mystery required to keep the audience guessing whether he is after her fortune or is really in love with her maggie smith is one of the finest actresses alive and raises the level of the movie considerably with her portrayal of the well meaning aunt finney is marvelous of course as the father who threatens to disinherit his daughter for her disobedience but the daughter is willing to risk that for the man she loves but does her ardent suitor still want her without her fortune this is only one instance where washington square differs from the heiress another instance is the ability to stick with it it is a handsome movie that is as tedious as a dripping faucet offering too little story in too long of a movie
i'm a rather pedestrian person with somewhat lowbrow tastes however i occasionally try to raise the bar on my cultural awareness this movie was one of my attempts i was in awe throughout the entire movie i liked it so much that i got my own tape so i could see it again this is a very thoughtful and emotionally striking movie i saw it as a huge question to the viewer what is the depth of sacrifice to duty one can accept can be asked to accept should accept as a military member this is of course an important question to me this question weighs heavily on the viewer of this movie br br recommended
if unlike some of the commenters here you are not staging a class war and don't mind seeing the lives of other people who are fairly successful extroverted bohemian gasp and not being terribly english at a party and getting into all sorts of trouble as a result this is not a bad film closer to euro cinema rather than an imitation of the usual slick american crap i believe the minimal sound design and cheap camera is a conscious decision rather than bad film making i'd defend this the film isn't any worse as a result and it puts the spotlight on the cast some of whom are really good kate hardie think that's her name as the sarcastic drunk is spot on the one exception being david baddiel who should never be allowed to appear in serious stuff it's light and we don't go for this kind of anatomising of relationship crap in this country but if you don't have any real friends to go to a party with than you could do worse than to sit in and watch this
the confidential part was meant to piggy back on the popular appeal of the lurid magazine of the same name while the labor racketeering theme tied in with headline congressional investigations of the day however despite the a grade b movie cast and some good script ideas the movie plods along for some 73 minutes it's a cheap jack production all the way what's needed to off set the poor production values is some imagination especially from uninspired director sidney salkow a few daylight location shots for example would have helped relieve the succession of dreary studio sets a stylish helmsman like anthony mann might have done something with the thick ear material but salkow treats it as just another pay day exercise too bad that brian keith's typical low key style doesn't work here coming across as merely wooden and lethargic at the same time cult figure elisha cook jr goes over the top as a wild eyed drunk clearly salkow is no actor's director but you've got to hand it to that saucy little number beverly garland who treats her role with characteristic verve and dedication too bad she wasn't in charge my advice skip it unless you're into ridiculous bar girls who do nothing else but knock back whiskeys in typical strait jacketed 50's fashion
sadly 8 simple rules for dating my teenage daughter was the last sitcom that john ritter got to work on after his tragic death in 2003 he was one of my all time favourite actors he had it all comedy who can forget him in three's company but he was also an excellent dramatic actor unforgivable  worth watching tv movie as much i loved all the other cast members of the show katey amy kaley and martin john was the star he was much of the reason i was drawn to the show in the first place and it was his perfect comedic delivery that was able to crack me up each and every time br br i loved how the show wasn't all sugary sweet as much as i loved the cosby show come on they were too nice to each other lol they portrayed the typical family dynamics brilliantly it was realistic enough what with all the sibling rivalry and the squabbles between parents but they still kept it funny a lot of american sitcoms try and fill the shows entirely with morals and what not and this show didn't do that yes there were some like tackling important issues such as drugs and bullying but they didn't try and be anything other than a fun family comedy br br the way they wrote john's death in to the show was brilliantly done i still sob like a baby each time i see it you could feel how raw the emotions were during those incredibly hard episodes br br i'm sad the show was cancelled i still enjoy watching the reruns and i never get tired of it br br john ritter you'll always be remembered for you hilarious depiction of this over protective father who would rather lock his daughters up in their room than have them date a boy you rock ritter
the poor dvd video quality is the only reason why i gave this movie a 9 instead of a 10 that could have been so much better this movie deserves it br br this is truly a movie that covers several themes simultaneously if you do not like movies about serial killers but are fascinated by the astonishing bureaucratic culture in the former sovjet union this movie is a must see anyway br br i can't compare it to silence of the lambs for several reasons the way the serial killer is portrayed has been done far much better in citizen x you see several details of his private life because you travel along with the killer which gives you some idea of the source of his constant anger and sexual frustration br br the only other movie i have seen that is as realistic as this one was henry portrait of a serial killer if you were fascinated by that movie you definitely need to take a look at citizen x
it makes one wonder how this show is still on the air there's been one couple that has stayed together married and has children but everyone else has broken up what's the point of continuing this the show can be entertaining at the beginning you see all the girls swooning over one man that almost all of them like instantly it's just like in real life the girls start to take sides bitch one another out and show their true selves or so we think but that one man is left to decide who to pick that he thinks he can marry and live happily ever after br br what is true love exactly how can you fall for someone when you're forced to pick them this show is unbelievable you thought dating online was bad but people have to go on tv to find love it's not realistic how could a girl be with a man when he is going out with several others making out with them none of these questions are answered and finally when the show ends you know there won't be a happy ending in the future for all we know everything is scripted
just another film that exploits gratuitous frontal male nudity awful acting plus the lovemaking scenes are the most un sexy i've ever seen and this is not about me not linking the idea of two young men making love since i'm gay br br again as in mil nubes de paz julian hernandez directed an incredibly pretentious film with a story that makes enough argument for a short film of about five minutes but manages to make a 2 hour film with it and this time there isn't even the issue of racism and commodification in the mexican gay community to talk about god gracious have mercy on us
just because an event really happened doesn't mean that it will make a good screenplay movie the cat's meow by peter bogdanovich claims to be based on actual events which happened on a cruise hosted by william randolph hurst the writer paid more attention to creating a bizarre cast of characters than taking time to create a story for the bizarre characters to inhabit the key moments of the story seem implausible for example when hurst accidentally shoots the producer believing him to be chaplin basing a key element of a story on someone wearing the wrong hat is trite and contrived the story attempts to be a dark comedy but the cat's meow misses an important piece of this equation comedy there is also a lack of empathy for any of the characters it hardly matters who is shot who is killed who is guilty and who is innocent there is not a strong character to cheer for as a result the conflicts are difficult to care about and the eventual outcome is incidental
i waited for this movie to come out for a while in canada and when it finally did i was very excited to see it i really enjoyed it of course in the beginning it is a very sad movie and it was new years day making it even sadder however it sticks with you the next day i was thinking about it again because although it revolves around something so emotionally draining you realize after a few days that it is such a beautiful story how one person can be seen as the link to so many people but sometimes you can be blinded so many things and how diane keaton's character kind of saves the rest of them by just being there and how they save her in the process as well it was such an excellent movie and chris pine one of my favourite actors provides the perfect comic relief it is definitely a movie that will need a box of tissues but will really stay with you for a long time
i have seen some bad movies austin powers the spy who shagged me batman forever but this film is so awful so boring that i got about half way through and could not bear watching the rest a pity boasting talent such as kenneth branagh embeth davitz and robert duvall and a story by john grisham what went wrong branagh is a big time lawyer who has a one night fling with davitz her father duvall is a psychopath who hanged her cat etc etc so branagh has him sent to a nuthouse and he promptly escapes somehow i couldn't figure out how robert downey jr daryl hannah famke janssen and tom berenger are all mixed into the story which moves slower than stationary i wanted to like this and being a huge grisham fan have read all about this movie and i foolishly expected something interesting this is honestly the worst film i've seen to date and i wish i could have my money refunded out of
a family with dad louis dale midkiff mom rachel denise crosby 10 year old eileen blaze berdalh and about 3 year old gage miko hughes move to this beautiful house in maine seemingly unaware of the semis that roar down the highway in front of their house every 90 seconds or so the neighbor across the way the wonderful fred gwynne makes them feel at home and shows them a pet cemetery where children bury their pets but a little further on is a sacred ground which can bring the dead back to life but the dead come back in a nasty mood br br definite spoilers the novel by stephen king was good it was long but it developed characters and situations that made you care what happened this movie jettisons all the character development and just plays up the gore and violence animals are killed on camera i know it's faked but it's still repulsive a little boy is hit by a semi and his casket pops open during the funeral in a totally sick scene he's brought back to life and attacks and kills people including his mom i do wonder how a 3 year old was able to hang her a ghostly jogger don't ask tries to help the family for no reason the movie just works the audience over shoving every gruesome death or violence into your face it just goes out of its way to shock you end spoilers br br acting is no help midkiff is just dreadful as the father he's handsome and buff but totally blank crosby isn't much better the two kids are just annoying only gwynne single handedly saves this picture with his effortless good acting br br this picture shows a total contempt for the audience taking large leaps in logic and having characters do incredibly stupid things especially midkiff at the end this movie was inexplicably a huge box office hit in 1989 which led to the even worse sequel in 1992 i saw it in a theatre back then and was disturbed how the audience kept cheering on the violence and was just appalled by what i saw a sick repulsive horror film a 1 all the way br br when you think it's all over and can't get worse the ramones sing a title song i don't wanna be buried in a pet cemetery truly beyond belief
the movie is about two brothers that are supposed to be alike but are not in any way expect for being smart one is a surgeon and they other is able to write a computer code geniuses as they like to call themselves which sounds very exaggerated if you compare it to personal characteristics can you perceive from the material of the title br br i honestly didn't like the style of the movie i believe that anxiety confusion and deep blues it brings are there for a purpose but what i don't get is why there is so much of it the movie is cheap on scenes and tells the story basically with no human aspect in it at all it gives the comic book like experience however it's visually numbing the viewer it somehow brings him inside the blues with brief dialogs monotonic scenes dynamic cut music and abrupt noises br br the movie's storyline is very simple most of what's going on is being dramatically pictured for long minutes mostly in confusing delirium simulating effects of drug use and dynamic cuts br br i will say openly that this movie didn't meet my expetations a tiny bit
i purchased the dvd set on a recommendation from amazon com based on my other interests they hit the nail on the head with this one i remember watching the show when it was on tv but always wondered what happened to it ten years later it's like watching it all again for the first time lucas black as caleb temple and gary cole as sheriff lucas buck are great together even though they are somewhat rivals almost representing good caleb and evil sherriff lucas buck i never really understood exactly what lucas was supposed to be but let it suffice to say he has some special powers that i don't believe were granted by anything holy he can make phones ring writing appear or even cause a person's emotions to change none the less there are a few episodes where he actually becomes the good guy in spite of it all all in all this is an excellent series that like so many others i can think of i e point pleasant threshold nowhere man and seaquest dsv just to name a few were cancelled way before their time the steven king's the dead zone sunday's usa network seems to be the only thing in this genre that seems to be making it there is just nothing fit to watch on tv anymore this is because anything that deals with christianity and satan is considered offensive and must be immediately pulled from tv so in the meantime i'll just keep buying dvd sets and watching shows that should still be on tv but were booted off tv by religious zealots so we could watch quality shows like family guy and american dad and the simpsons what a bunch of crap that is
working from a script written in part by nicholas pileggi best known for writing the book wiseguy which he adapted into the movie goodfellas and for writing the book and screenplay casino director harold becker shows how connected circles scratch each other's backs even in the command of a comparatively honorable mayor like pappas who is regarded as a presidential prospect as cusack follows the paper trail of the dead mobster's probation report his skepticism is agitated how did this violent young man get probation rather than a jail sentence we meet the other players in the plot not the least of which is danny aiello the political boss of brooklyn and tony franciosa the mafia boss whose nephew was shot dead how and why these people are affiliated i leave to the movie to divulge though there are never any misgivings that they are br br the narrative is told generally through the eyes of the cusack character a visionary from louisiana who admires his boss and hopes to learn from him much is made by everyone of bureaucratic knowledge passed down through the generations some of the dialogue is ungracefully erudite but considering i just described the building blocks of the story as bureaucratic knowledge one can't say it doesn't work the shooting case builds against the seasoning of two other issues on the mayor's desk a charge by aiello for a subway stop and an off ramp in brooklyn to aid a new banking center and the city's bid for the next democratic convention individual idiosyncrasies are also explored including aiello's emotional bond with the music of rogers and hammerstein br br much also is made of menschkeit a yiddish expression which pappas explains to his deputy is about the bond of honor between two men about what happens between the two hands in a handshake this connection doesn't mean much to bridget fonda the lawyer for the policeman's association who defends the dead cop's honor and fights for his widow's pension even as incriminating evidence appears little by little the deputy mayor comes to grasp that menschkeit is such an influential notion that it outclasses he law br br there are various scenes of hard impact including one where the brooklyn boss comes home for lunch in the middle of the day his wife asserts her interest through the medium of the dish she has cooked and then the mafia boss drops in by surprise there is also a compelling and markedly conjectural late scene between the mayor and his deputy br br one scene handled with delicacy is comprised of the mayor's decision to speak at the funeral of the slain child in a harlem church his advisers tell him he won't be wanted there but he goes anyway and cranks himself up for a spiel of unabashed hyperbole pacino and his character both br br it gets an impressive reaction from the congregation but the mayor knows and his deputy knows that it was artificial and the way they scrupulously evade discussing it in the limousine taking them away is a subtle employment of composure and innuendo this is a script that knows it has to supply pacino with the reason why most of his fans go to see him and immediately follows its quota with the reality that silence has much more inherent meaning than speech br br pacino and cusack are convincing together throughout the movie the older man unbreakable and aware the younger one anxious to learn but with ideals that don't sway pacino is innate with his down to earth capacity to marry common sense and inventive imagination inspired flair and matter of fact realism cusack moves very freely in spite of his dark defensiveness br br the bridget fonda subplot development is unnecessary but it is a result of veteran screenwriter paul schrader's otherwise shrewdly perceptive belief in the worth of every character and each is fleshed into earnest embodiments aiello for instance is a highlight because he evokes his character's joie de vivre and sensitivity to his environment
at least the seats in the theater were comfortable and i ate the pop corn as loud as possible to drown out the inferior dialogue this is absolutely not a girls film any blokes who like it are the ones us ladies can be sure to stay far away from dumb story mediocre dialogue and an overall cheap looking film i've seen many many movies but this one is the new winner in the bad category if you do happen to see it the one thing you'll look forward to is the ending so you can finally run out of the theater as fast as you can
after several extremely well ratings to the point of superb i was extremely pleased with the film the film was dark moving the anger the pain the guilt and a very extremely convincing demon br br i had initially expected to see many special effects and like a lover's caress it blew me away with the subtlety and the rightness of it brian i am again blown away with your artistry with the telling of the story and your care of the special effects you will go a long way my friend i will definitely be the president of your fan club br br eric etebari the best actor award was the number one choice you made jr lopez look like a child compared to kasadya br br overall the acting story line the high quality filming and awesome effects it was fantastic i just wish it were longer i am looking forward to the dreamless with extremely high expectations
if there's one genre that i've never been a fan of it's the biopic always misleading filled with false information over dramatized scenes and trickery all around biopics are almost never done right even in the hands of the truly talented directors like martin scorsese the aviator and ron howard a beautiful mind they often do a great disservice to the people they are trying to capture on screen skeptiscism takes the place of hype with the majority of biopics that make their way to the big screen and the notorious bettie page was no different some critics and moviegoers objected to gretchen mol given the role of bettie page saying she was no longer a celebrity and didn't have the chops for the part i never doubted mol could handle the part since but i never expected to as blown as away by her performance as i was upon just viewing the film hours ago mol delivers a knockout oscar worthy performance as the iconic 1950's pin up girl who after an early life of abuse depicted subtlety and tastefully done something few directors would probably do inadvertently becomes one of the most talked about models of all time the picture covers a lot of ground in its 90 minute running time yet despite no less than three subplots there is still a feeling that there may be a small portion missing from the story director co writer marry harron and guinevere turner's fantastic script is only marred by a too abrupt and not as clear as it should be ending still credit must be given to the two ladies for creating a nearly flawless biopic that manages to pay tribute to both its subject and the decade it emulates masterfully come oscar time mol turner and harron should be receiving nominations doubt it will happen though there certainly are no three women more deserving of them 9 10
if this movie should be renamed it should be the jackasses of hazzard to sum it up this movie is nothing but 88 minutes of two immature country punks joyriding the famed 1968 dodge charger around town and in the country chasing the girls and eluding the law br br i have been a fan of the dukes and what tarnishes the movie is the characters are out of key the overindulgence of profanity sexual references and drug use has made the good name of the dukes into trailer trash br br side from comparing it to the television show the acting was horrible the only actor that got it right was the famed 1969 dodge charger named general lee the others have exaggerated the character's role which tarnished the movie br br the dukes have been another casualty of the 21 st century hollywood television to big screen transition tragedy skip this movie and just buy the television series on dvd br br my grade f
this movie really i mean really sucks its got plot holes so big and 30 foot dragon can fit through them not to mention the dragon itself which is inevitably the worst computer generated image ever to be put on the film real i mean when you see something like this you gotta be thinking wow someone actually made this movie then released it that takes guts whoever they are i'm sure they don't work in the film business anymore br br when i hired this movie it wasn't in on dvd so i reluctantly took it out on video the first thing to appear was a lord of the rings trailer for the two towers this was a very clever move putting this trailer on the video it justifies me reluctantly giving the film 1 star otherwise i would have given it zero stars maybe the producers though the star attraction of dean cain i think thats how you spell it would draw in the crowds uh to the video store that is br br next they employed split screen technique like in hulk to i assume compensate for what an atrocity this piece of crap film is on the box cover we see a picture of our hero and the dragon does the dragon look exactly like the one in dragonheart or is it just me either way the dragon in the film looks like a reject from gremlins 2 and has the cgi of a nintendo video game villain from the early 90's perhaps worse also not the dragons movement as it pursues its victims its the same f cking monotonous movement right leg left leg right leg left leg dom dom dom dom dom dom f king dooooom this just pisses me off maybe the filmmakers thought this was thrilling and would have the same effect of jaws why not then have a dragon pov shot either way that was just funny much like watching a weebl toon br br dean cain gives many puzzled looks during the film maybe his coming to terms with the fact that this film could end his career don't expect superman here the first time i saw the trailer for this film i thought it was an add for a ps2 game br br as for the story its so so bad my 5 year old brother can come up with better ones when he's unconvincingly trying to lie about why he was messing around in my room while i wasn't there oh and did i mention that i f king hate the people who made this incredibly stupid stupid crap atrocious film
well how do you even rate a movie such as this one does it even have cinematic value really it's a movie that tries to get as close to being a snuff movie as possible basically the entire movie is purely a bunch of guys torturing a young girl not very appealing and on top of that also not that realistic really br br it's obvious that the movie tried to be as realistic and shocking as possible however the movie is just all too fake for that to work out as intended the slapping and stumping is all soft and fake looking as well as sounding they are often just kicking into the floor rather than into the girl obviously also the way the girl responds to all the torments is pretty tame i mean if this was real surely she would had screamed it out there is more moaning than screaming in this one though br br the movie is obviously low budget and it's a valor attempt at trying to achieve something shocking and realistic as well as original and provoking with very limited resources don't really think this movie made much impact though at the time it got released though it must had done something well since a total of six sequels got released after this one br br fans of shock and gore will most likely be disappointed by this movie though there are still some fetish people out there who will get a kick out of this movie br br 4 10
enormous fun for both adults and children this film works on numerous levels there is everything from car crashes and cake in the face to some very good yet subtle jokes for adults br br glenn close is at her sublimely evil best as cruella call me ella' de ville br br after three years in dr pavlov's behaviour modification clinic she is cured of her desire for fur  even the puppy skin fur she had so intensely desired she even has all of her fur coats placed in the dungeon of the extraordinary castle she inhabits br br but it wouldn't be a dalmatian' movie without the subterfuge and machinations of cruella and you know that something will change her behaviour modification and now she needs one extra puppy hence 102 dalmatians to complete her nefarious scheme this time round br br ioan gruffudd is instantly appealing as the hero of the film that runs the second chance' dog shelter though he was in titanic' and in last year's television version as pip of great expectations' i didn't recognize him well he was fifth officer lowe' in titanic' and i didn't see great expectations' so i am not terribly surprised br br gerard depardieu does a delightful turn as the furrier pawn of cruella he prances and postures in the most outlandish and outrageous of fur clothing you have ever seen  and does it well his 'wicked witch of the west' homage is hilarious br br tim mcinnerny is superb is cruella's not so evil henchman  he was also alonzo ' cruella's butler in 101 dalmatians' and you may also recognize him from all of the black adder' brit coms he plays his usual bumbling good hearted somewhat dim witted character to great effect br br oscars for costuming are generally given for the entirety of the costuming in a film this is unfortunate as the clothing worn by glenn close is amazing  it is incredibly detailed note her handcuffs when she is being released from the behaviour modification clinic and worthy of such an over the top character her clothing alone deserves at least an oscar nomination br br animation holds a special place in my heart  but comparing this film to the original animated film is like comparing apples to orangutans it can't be done suffice it to say that 102 dalmatians' is even better than the film version of 101 dalmatians' that came out in 1996 there is a lot to like here from the sight gags the dialogue and the costumes to the casting it is a good film for the whole family
poor michael madsen he must be kicking himself to know folks have found out about this horrible flick i really can't think of anything worse i have ever seen except amateur porn it's that bad and all here wooden acting bad script crappy moral ending you hate it and it is in this movie br br my question is who the hell put into this piece of doggy doo at least we could have seen michael's sister virginia nude in a scene but i don't think even that would save this stinker br br for a cool guy that has made some exception movies i want to know what wacky church sponsored this piece of crapola
i went in to this movie thinking it was going to be the next clerks but left feeling let down the humor was weak and the characters fairly flat that isn't to say it was all bad the idea of the dating service in the grocery store seemed like pretty fertile material but the director switched focus to the cliche'd save the mom and pop store from the evil corporation guy i felt like if he would have just stuck with the dating service plot he would have come out with a much more memorable movie now to do the film justice i am from the rochester area and loved the way he portrayed webster in fact the best kevin smith of clerks homage here was giving props to his hometown webster ny is to checkout what red bank nj is to clerks the director wisely threw in a date at nick tahou's trust me as far as things to do in rochester a garbage plate is at the top of the list i was lucky enough to see this film at the little in rochester so everybody knew when the odes to the town came up and appreciated them
im the type of person who always goes 2 to horror section when i'm picking a film so i picked five across the eyes i was disgusted with this film and thought there was no story line and no point that you could enjoy it it made my skin crawl to think that people like to watch films that just encourage violence for the hell of it it was low budget and very rubbish i think i could of done better myself i think that it was the worst film i have ever seen in my life and you should not bother to watch it the actors were rubbish the camera was awful the picture was bad and the sound was not up to scratch i think it was a little bit like a cheep rip of off the baler which project and it has not worked at all it was foul
if you want to see women's breasts get a porno there is no plot but the last 45 minutes of this movie focus on resolving some sort of dangerous plan the only value this movie has is that sometimes its so bad its funny and yes boobs are boobs
one thing that astonished me about this film and not in a good way was that nathan stoltzfus who seems to pride himself on being the major historian on the topic of the rosenstrasse was one of the historians working on this film considering how much of the actual events were altered or disregarded br br another reviewer said that von trotta said she never meant for lena to bed goebbels but in that case why did she give every impression that that was what had happened why not show other possible reasons for the mens' release such as the disaster that was stalingrad or the nazis' fear that the international press based in berlin would find out about the protest br br also why did the whole storyline play second fiddle to a weak family bonding storyline that has been done over and over again surely something as awesome as this could carry its own history in places it was as if the film had two story lines that really seemed to have little in common br br overall this film failed in its aim which was to draw attention to a little known act of resistance which is a shame because done better it could have had a major impact
when it comes down to fairy tales cinderella was the one that made you cry the most poor cinderella is a girl who had her whole life stolen by 2 evil and ugly stepsisters and a slave driving step mother and thanks to mr walt disney we got to witness cinderella in animation br br before the story begins cinderella and her father are lonely and rich beyond their needs to share his wealth and to give his daughter some sisters cinderella's dad marries a woman but then dies soon after the stepmother only seeing dollar signs in her eyes and slavery in her gorgeous step daughter cinderella br br so for many days cinderella is a slave to her step mother and her step sisters she has hope however thanks to her friends the mice of the home sounds like cinderella wasn't playing with a full deck she has hope that one day she'll find her prince the chance eventually comes when the prince of the kingdom needs a girlfriend br br 9 10
quite typical for swedish movies of this type strange that the acting was soooo bad these actors usually give a good show the casting was poorly done it made you expect something i won't tell you what the lead character was awful i don't know where they find her anyway stay away from this and go see den tredje vågen instead this is swedish action in is prime
carry on matron was released in 1972 and it's becoming clear that the series has reached a natural end with the best entries like cleo up the kyber and screaming being from the mid to late 60s br br in itself matron is by no means bad it's just that we've seen it all before with a thin plot a bunch of spivs trying to break into a hospital to steal a supply of contraceptive pills which they plan to sell to third world countries surrounded by gags of a slightly amusing though unsophisticated nature i think that's where the problem lies the gags aren't all that amusing with the unsophisticated nature starting to show its age did we need another movie that uses a man dressed up as a woman in order to drive the plot perhaps the worst criticism i can make is that i saw carry on matron this afternoon less that twelve hours ago and i have a problem in trying to remember a very funny line that's a serious problem for a comedy
nu image ufo and others produce films for the sci fi channel that come in with budgets of roughly 2 million some feature extensive effects work others feature recognizable casts and still others feature both for 2 million br br mr hines initially claimed that this film was budgeted at 20 million dollars but it's painfully obvious that this was probably produced for 750 000 if not considerably less than that few sets are utilized a number of scenes are shot against green screen and most effects seem incomplete and amateurish br br it's painful to watch not so much because it is poorly directed poorly executed and misguided but because many of us have been following the progress of this production for quite some time and had high hopes for this film despite its relatively modest budget br br those of us who believed in this movie when it was originally announced have joined the legions of those spoken of by p t barnum
hi br br i heard about lost from a co worker that had obvious differences of opinion on entertainment he loved it well i watched an episode or 2 in the early seasons and was bored so i tuned it out after a few years i stumbled upon lost bored with the current sci fi fare wow was i surprised can you say gravity well damn i got sucked in the pace and scripting are very good some of the flash forward backs are so so with the lamer characters but over all good my favorite characters are ben locke jacob richard alpert sayid jarrah sawyer hurley daniel faraday jin wife walt charlie desmond and jack's dad jack and michael definitely are immature asshats very spoiled and immature kate 1 step above them juliet was way more classy than kate mr eko way under rated and on the level of charlie if not more too bad they both died the guy dressed in black talking to jacob way back is a genuine curiosity as a whole great very layered series looking for more br br regards
the movie begins a with mentally challenged girl with bright yellow sneakers looking skyward on a madrid street corner and being spellbound by a passing plane the movie examines the life of five womenadela leire maricarmen anita isabelwho have completely different lives and choices of shoes their shoes is the first superficial yet affixed with some glancing meaning clue we get at their fragile identities in a theatrically embroidered and embellished way a podiatrist tries to esoterically reveal the deepest secrets of a woman's souls by the sole of her feet the premise is risky and slightly contrived but the tone and depth of the movie takes a daring plunge for the good br br what may have been light hearted and superficial quickly switches gear with the a superb dysfunctional couple scene that leaves the viewer riveted for minutes seeing the love or lack thereof the pain the confusion the hope the needs and escape mechanisms develop through minutes different rooms of the house and down to the street and eventually below what a scene but there will be others as effective to follow and strengthen the strong characterization and directing displayed in this slice of life affair br br moving along a woman has lost the husband she loved and inherited his kids and his taxi while another has completely lost her husband emotionally sexually intellectually but not physically a ghost a pending divorce reproach regret remorse a new love can you love a mirage can you love the person in the mirror can you love someone you can't love or think you can't love can you love and live life even though it will always be somewhat hopeless yet isn't it exactly these hopes and dreams that keep us here grounded and in a spectrum of relative happiness a lot of deep themes emerge and the final act brings people and ideas together to coalesce in an existential crisis with no clear cut solution definitive decision or effective healing maybe a elusive thought a fleeting feeling but a lasting appreciation of life and of the artistry and intellect of the film live live again rewind the reel unveil the real the important the big stones piedras of life the rest is just details
this movie is by far the cutest i have seen in a long time wonderful animation and adorable characters even the bad guys were cute made this one a total winner in my book and also in the books of those i saw it with i still want to see it again but haven't had time better than toy story which was good too but not this good
not having read nabokov and knowing nothing about chess i could only view the luzhin defence as a movie br br it works really well as one of my favorite genres sports romances the chess comes alive as a tough competition much more than in say searching for bobby fischer in showing just how much hard mental work the game can be requiring thought preparation stamina and planning i particularly liked the special effects on the chess board as alternative plays are anticipated br br through the feminist director maureen gorris of antonia emily watson with her big blue eyes gradually strengthens via her transformative relationship with john turturro's fairly one note absent minded intense chess genius br br the settings in italy and hungary are beautiful br br originally written 5 27 2001
this is a fan made short film that pretends to be a preview for a new movie that pairs batman and superman it's the sort of film that fans adore and watch at places like comiccon and was made by the same person who made batman dead end sandy collora br br as far as this film goes i could easily pick it apart sure the cgi effects aren't perfect and the costumes are far from perfect but this was made on a shoestring budget and for a fan film this is incredible i was particularly impressed by the very buff superman he was no wimpy little guy if only this were a preview for a real film they'd have fans lined up from here to omaha to see it great job
despite its budget limitations this is a great film proof that effort and imagination can overcome lack of cash the opening in which cave paintings seem to show how some dinosaurs at least survived into the age of human beings is a nice red herring after that a meteor comes down into a lake and causes heat which in turn causes the hatching of a frozen dinosaur egg maybe the cave paintings suggest instead that this isn't the first time such a thing has happened when the prehistoric beast appears it's a well animated plesiosaur which is soon causing disappearances in the local area alright so it's not jurassic park but it's still genuine entertainment for fans of monster movies
one of the funnest mario's i've ever played the levels are creative there are fluid controls and good graphics for its time there's also a multitude of crazy bosses and enemies to fight sometimes the levels get frustrating and if you leave out some of the hard levels and still need to get more accomplished to fight a boss it can be annoying another complaint is the camera angle though it works fairly well most of the time it can be a pain in certain situations if your a big time mario fan this ones for you even if your not a huge fan of him i'd still recommend this one its a big game and getting what you need can take a while but it's very satisfying good for playing in short bursts of time it will almost certainly hold your interest it sure does hold mine
now this show looks like most of the other shows of it's type from the mid 90's but the only thing is about this one is that it's different they use a lot of comedy and action in this one and maybe a little bit of drama too i personally thought it was a good show i can't understand why would they cancel it the good thing is that the fan base of this show is still alive ever since 1997 up to date br br my hopes is that the wb bring back the show or even do a movie which i know is gonna be impossible to do but hey it doesn't hurt to dream doesn't it br br anyway i would recommend if you hadn't seen it to find the dvd of all 13 episodes because the characters are great the story lines are good the comedy is good and well the whole show is just great
this is simply the most astonishing movie you will ever see i thought it was just another documentary but it really is something else it doesn't try to teach you anything it shows you how life works in nature br br i won't talk about the quality of the pictures because you obviously know from other comments it is unmatched br br earth is funny tense and sad it can make you laugh it can make you cry sometimes both at the same time this is the first movie that made me cry not because you feel sorry for the animals but because you come to realise how fragile our planet is and what treasure we were blessed with yet we don't appreciate it one bit br br this movie should be shown obligatory in schools it is the most wonderful film you will ever see so go and see it who knows maybe it is the last time we might see our planet like this br br 10 10 but i would easily rate it more if it were possible
now i love american pie 1 and 2 while 3 was great just for seann william scott's performance as stifler but after that the quality has dropped band camp kept the standard reasonably high with characters you actually cared about but naked mile was the same joke and plot lines recycled erik stifler's sex problem is like jim's it had some amusing moments like the football game against the midgets and the 'punishment' of coozeman but on the whole it lacked originality and the 'mile' was just stupid and moronic not to mention the irritating girlfriend who doesn't want to have sex br br anyway enough about the naked mile i watched beta house with apprehension as i thought it could take the series to a new low but i was pleasantly surprised to be honest there is no real plot but it's filled with hot girls ashley is incredible and sex jokes aplenty yes it is formulaic and the jokes are old but dwight stifler steve talley raises the bar with an exuberant performance the greek olympiad is entertaining especially the penultimate and final events while christopher mcdonald's cameo is hilarious there are weak points though coozeman is as irritating as he was in the first i'm still baffled to as how he ever got a part br br while coozeman is bad erik stifler is worse john white made naked mile a pain to watch but in beta house he takes his performance to a whole new low first and foremost he lacks charisma a stifler prerequisite you really can't care less about him the only reason i was bothered about his relationship was so ashley could be on screen she shines above him as does the rest of the cast seriously john white is the ultimate in bad acting and has about as much charisma as a dead fish br br saying that the film does entertain and coozeman's fear that his girl is not exactly a girl is brilliantly funny br br overall this film is worth renting get a few of your mates in and have a laugh at the vomit fest event and vent your anger at erik 'loser' stifler
i was up late flipping cable channels one night and ran into this movie from about 10 minutes into the start every time i even thought going to bed something kept on telling me to keep on watching it even though it was way way way past my bedtime br br this movie could have been another easy slam dunk anti gun film but instead they chose to examine the aftereffects of the shootings and even better the movie kept on with the real life just when you think they are going to take the easy and obviously contrived way out a twist comes along and changes the whole outlook of the movie this film not only doesn't follow the formula it shows how other events often lead up to and or affect what happens afterwards br br i only wish the filmmakers had explored the issues around anti depressant drugs more the kids from columnbine who did the shootings were on them for years and it was frightening to watch the way deanna popped them every time the nightmares started up until recently they were dispensing the stuff like candy and only now do they even begin to understand what long term effects the drugs have it was very refreshing to see that the mental illness aspect of the story was given quite a bit of film having a relative who suffers from a mental illness i can say that the movie was dead nuts on in every aspect of mental illnesses bravo to the director and writer who obviously did their homework on those issues and for those who think certain things couldn't happen in a hospital i don't want to tell any particulars you're dead wrong on that too i've been there the script was so real it was amazing br br go buy this film and show it to your teenage kids before it's too late someday they'll thank you for it
this is a bad bad movie i'm an actual fencer trust me when i say that this film's pretension of accuracy is just that this is especially true during that vile little scene when the fencers are combining footwork with 80's pop the ending is predictable and the movie is a bore from start to finish horrible
terminus paradis was exceptional but niki ardelean comes too late we already have enough of this and we want something new br br big directors should have no problems seeing beyond their time not behind why people see romania only as a postrevolutionary country br br we are just born not reincarnated and nobody gives a s t anymore about old times most people dont remember or dont want to remember and the new generation of movie consumers dont understand a bit this should be the first day of romanian movie not the final song priveghi maybe younger directors should make the move
i found this family film to be pleasant and enjoyable even though i am not a child it is based on the concept of a high school girl susan elisha cuthbert discovering that the elevator in her upper class apartment building becomes a time machine when a key on a key chain she got from a blind scientist is turned in the elevator lock she learns how to control the machine with some uncertainty about time of day br br the film is not a work of serious science fiction you have to ignore the usual instability paradox associated with altering the past through time travel i e the past is changed to prevent the 1881 walker family from becoming poor but the change means the family never got into financial trouble so victoria wouldn't have told susan about the financial problems her mother had which means that susan shouldn't have had a reason to change the past in the first place but other than that there are some nice touches in the story such as the old elevator panel found in the apartment of the woman who secretly invented and installed the time machine not having a space for the lock that activates the time machine feature as in many stories for children we need to also suppose that a child will not share startling information about a time travel device with a parent or other adult but instead hide the time traveler br br it also requires disregarding some poorly staged scenes and uninspired performances by some of the adult actors the child actors elisha cuthbert gabrielle boni and matthew harbour all were very convincing in their parts in one scene in the 1300s native americans notice susan observing and photographing them but they don't register surprise in the sudden appearance of this blond white skinned girl in peculiar dress their response is to simply stop what they are doing and to walk calmly towards susan in the same scene an indian mother is carrying what is supposed to be a baby but is so obviously a doll its white skinned and its head flops around br br timothy busfield the award winning actor who originally came to fame in tv's old thirty something gives a somewhat uninteresting sometimes listless performance in the other extreme michel perron hams it up as the italian building superintendent janitor as does richard jutras in his role as a nosy neighbor the neighbor's name is edward ormondroyd which is the name of the author of the novel the film is based on i suspect that these problems may be the fault either of the director or possible of a low budget br br despite these flaws i recommend the movie for kids in addition to the interesting story it also has some educational value in that it points out how much both technology and social norms have changed in little more that 100 years
i found the writing in this movie absolutely terrible br br the only thing that saved this movie from me rating it as a 1 out of 10 was lacy chabert's performance who i thought played the multiple personalities really well for me she was definitely the highlight of this movie br br dina meyer was pretty as always but i found her role pretty bland so i don't think one can say that her acting was great br br as for the male lead armand assante his interpretation of the role reminded me mainly of doctors in cheese 1980s hospital series br br all of that i could have lived with however the terrible terrible terrible end solution the role of the psychic and even the role of psychic were just some of the worst writing i have seen in a long time
finally an indie film that actually delivers some great scares i see most horror films that come out theatrical straight to dvd cable etc and most of them suck a few are watchable even fewer are actually good dark remains is one of the good ones i caught a screening of this film at the south padre island film festival the audience loved it and my wife and i loved it having no name actors i assume the budget on this film was pretty low but you wouldn't know it the film looks fantastic the acting totally works for the film the story is good and the scares are great while most filmmakers focus solely on the scares they often forget about story and character development two things that help to deliver the scares more efficiently brian avenet bradley must know that character and story are important he develops both to the point where you care about the characters you know the characters and are therefore more scared when they are in danger br br watching horror films that cost anywhere from 80 million to 5000 to make i find dark remains to be one of the gems out there check this film out
this movie was just plain bad just about every cop movie cliché is present and accounted for bad guy gets away check partner check wacky personality clash with partner check rookie with something to prove check rookie shows up grizzled veteran check about the only ones it didn't touch on were idiot shoot themselves in the foot and retirony but i guess they're saving those old chestnuts for dooley's next outing add in the battle of the sexes with girl power along with tired old sight gags and banal overdone material like dooley's prize car getting trashed all the time and you have the recipe for one really bad movie avoid this one at all costs
the last hunt is one of the few westerns ever made to deal with buffalo hunting both as a sport and business and as a method of winning the plains indian wars before the white man set foot on the other side of the mississippi the plains used to have herds of american bison as large as some of our largest cities by the time of the period the last hunt is set in the buffalo had been all but wiped out the 20th century due to the efforts of conservationists saw a revival in population of the species but not hardly like it once was br br robert taylor and stewart granger are co starring in a second film together and this one is far superior to all the brothers were valiant here stewart granger is the good guy a world weary buffalo hunter who has to go back to a job he hates because of financial considerations br br the partner he's chosen to throw in with is robert taylor forgetting taylor for the moment i doubt if there's ever been a meaner nastier soul than charlie gilsen who taylor portrays in devil's doorway he was an american indian fighting against the prejudice stirred up by a racist played by louis calhern in the last hunt he's the racist here he kills both buffalo and indians for pure pleasure he kills one indian family when they steal his mules and takes the widow of one captive like some barbarian conqueror he expects the pleasure of debra paget's sexual favors he's actually mad when paget doesn't see it that way br br no matter how often they refer to russ tamblyn as a halfbreed i was never really convinced he was any part indian it's the only weakness i found in the last hunt br br however lloyd nolan the grizzled old buffalo skinner taylor and granger bring along is just great nolan steals every scene he's in with the cast br br for those who like their westerns real who want to see a side of robert taylor never seen on screen and who don't like cheap heroics the last hunt is the ideal hunt
i always wondered what happened with that magic kind of feeling the old slovenian movies seemed to have in them well in time i wondered if that feeling was just the nostalgia or did that feeling decide to pack its bags and say goodbye somewhere in the middle of our cinematic history and then never came back or did it because for me it came back the first time i saw ekspres ekspres and it was it's old self again br br there are three qualities of this movie that makes it somewhat unique and as enjoying as it is to watch the smooth flow of the story the warmth of the colors and what i appreciated the most the lack of excessive use of verbal communication something many of other not just slovenian screenwriters should at least consider there is no use for words when you can understand each other just as well yeah or better by other means in use just watch bakovic and cerar uh br br so this in only so many words is why i would recommend ekspres ekspres to all of you as a must see slovenian movie regardless of what you may heard of slovenian films if you ever even heard anything that is br br oh and that scene where bakovic is dancing to vivaldi's music a treat br br treat yourself watch it
there's a lot of movies that have set release dates only to get pulled from distribution due to a legal snafu of some kind and then put in limbo for a long time you can only wish a film as rotten as slackers remained in a coma for what it's worth which is miniscule release dates were continually shifted around for this truly awful movie that is so much a bleep on the radar like it deserves the premise kicks off under the guise of ethan a creepy nerd with a scary obsession for the campus bombshell angela ethan devilishly enlists the aid of david and his friends who have been scamming the school for their entire run with blackmail to help win angela i don't like to give spoilers out but for a piece of crap like this i can make an exception angela falls for david ethan intentionally screws everything up the good guys win that's what happens in a nutshell for another tired retread of the teen gross out genre gross humor is funny it always has been dating back to the days of the immortal classic animal house to the likes of contemporaries like there's something about mary and road trip amongst dozens of others of which there are too many to mention but when you use it as a plot point you can only get so far case in point ethan has an angela doll composed of her individual strands of hair of which he does god knows what with it no one wants to take witness to watch ethan urinating in the shower while singing to himself no one wants to watch a young man singing she'll be coming around the mountain with a sock on his penis but nothing can prepare you for the full visual assault of seeing 50's bombshell mamie van doren bare her breasts at 71 years old i don't know if it's the story's lack of coherence which cuts to scenes that make absolutely no sense director dewey nicks was a former fashion photographer and after reviewing this film you can only wish he'll go back to the profession the worst thing you can do on any film is to make it look like you're having fun because you detract from your objectives just like slackers does by burying it's plot outline under a pile of gross out gags pointless vignettes and lack of construction it's like a bunch of college students got drunk took one's camcorder and shot a bunch of random crap and compiled it together if you want to see a teen gross out comedy that's actually good then i suggest american pie and animal house or road trip just something that's entertaining and not dreadfully bad like slackers coincidentally cameron diaz makes a cameo in this film just as she did in another bad film such as the sweetest thing where the story treats gross humor like another plot instead of a device much like this disaster if you pass by slackers at your local video store just keep on walking and let it end up at the bottom of the shelf like it deserves
i thought this was a truly awful film i found myself actually yelling at my tv a couple times one or both of the gay male leads was miscast there was absolutely no chemistry between them and richard ruccolo looked like he'd rather be kissing a dog the movie covers their long and tortured courtship highlighting each break up and make up but not developing the reasons in between in any detail these reasons would make for some interesting characters not the fight or the make up scene in bed lame even if you liked the movie br br andrea martin and adam goldberg shine as their characters but it doesn't make the film worth renting save your money
apparently shakespeare equals high brow which equals in turn a bunch of folks not seeing something for what it really is at one point in this film someone i believe pacino's producer warns him that film is getting off track that it was once about how the masses think about shakespeare through the vehicle of richard iii instead he decides to shoot a chopped up play with random comments sprinkled throughout some scenes seemed to be included as home movies for al was there really any reason for the quick visit to shakespeare's birthplace other than for a laugh about something unexpected which happens there and before the film has really even begun we are treated to seeing al prance around and act cute and funny for the camera i thought his silly act with kay near the end of godfather iii with the knife to his throat was an act but apparently it's how al really behaves in person br br enough rambling here's a shotgun smattering of why i didn't even make it 3 4 of the way through this 1 pretentious al always knows when the camera is on him whether he's acting as richard or in a 'real' conversation with someone you can see it in the corner of his eyes also some of the actors around the rehearsal table become untethered and wax hammy to the extreme if anyone reading this has ever spent any time with an group of actors and has witnessed this kind of thing from the outside it's unbearable look at me chewing all the scenery 2 winona ryder when she appears as lady anne this film comes to a screeching halt which it never recovers from she has nothing to add in the discussion scenes but the camera lingers on her to bring in the kiddoes her performance is dreadful to boot 3 the only things you really learn from this are told to you by the very scholars the filmmakers are trying to keep out of the picture of course you also learn that pacino shouldn't be directing films or doing richard in the first place i'd rather watch bobby deerfield than this br br lastly read the play and learn it for yourself go out and see it performed in 1997 i saw the play performed at the university of washington ethnic cultural theater and it made what we see in this film seem like high school drama except for the gratuitous throat slashing of clarence my god was that necessary br br it's all just a bunch of sound and fury signifying nada
ask the dust looked intriguing from the trailer and we especially like all of the actors unfortunately the movie was not compelling enough to be considered drama and it wasn't funny enough to be a comedy it practically seemed to satirize itself and to no entertaining effect after seventy minutes of waiting for this thing to get better my wife and i walked out valuing not having wasted any more time on such nonsense it simply was not interesting moving funny nor artistic it appears as though it were written produced and directed by a high school kid worse yet it was such a shameful waste of otherwise extraordinarily talented actors not to mention our time and money
i often feel like scrooge slamming movies that others are raving about or i write the review to balance unwarranted raves i found this movie almost unwatchable and unusual for me was fast forwarding not only through dull clichéd dialog but even dull clichéd musical numbers whatever originality exists in this film unusual domestic setting for a musical lots of fantasy some animation is more than offset by a script that has not an ounce of wit or thought provoking plot development individually june haver and dan dailey appear to be nice people but can't carry a movie as a team neither is really charismatic or has much sex appeal they're both bland i like billy gray but his character is pretty one note the best part of the film to me are june haver's beautiful costumes and great body
alfred hitchcok is not my favorite director by any means but imagine what he could have done with this the plot holds much potential for suspense john garfield is as almost always excellent and raymond massey is scarily cast against type nancy coleman is not a very impressive leading lady but the supporting cast is large and very capable br br yes it starts to sag fairly early there are too many coincidences and an important subject is trivialized by its being made into little more in the end than a love story br br it's fun to watch for garfield massey and the character performers but it's not awfully good
around the late 1970's animator don bluth frustrated with the output his company disney was churning defected from the mouse house to form his own studio his first production the secret of nimh was a brilliant feature that still holds up well to this day this was followed by an american tail and the land before time both of which were made under the involvement of steven spielberg and were commercially successful although none of those two films had the dark adult appeal of nimh they still are very charming enjoyable features for both children and grown ups but before long don bluth had his first major misfire with all dogs go to heaven critics were especially harsh on this film and matters weren't helped by the fact that it opened alongside disney's the little mermaid br br considering that the movie has such a friendly sounding title one would expect all dogs go to heaven to be pleasant family fare instead bluth provides a surprisingly dark story involving gambling deceit crime mistreatment and murder that itself is not a problem for an animated feature per say but it does call into question over whether the film is for children on the other hand it's hard to say whether adults will find much to enjoy in all dogs go to heaven in short it's a movie with a major identity crisis br br set in a dreary junkyard of new orleans the movie starts out when charlie b barkin a rough and tumble german shepherd is run over by a car courtesy of his former gambling casino partner a nasty cigar puffing pitbull carface before you know it charlie finds himself in heaven albeit by default here a whippet angel annabelle tells him that all dogs go to heaven because unlike people dogs are usually loyal and kind this line represents the confused nature of the movie since the dogs in the movie the whippet aside are presented as anything but br br upon realizing that he's been murdered charlie steals his way back to earth and plots to get even with carface with the reluctant help of his dachshund pal itchy charlie rescues carface's prize annemarie a human girl who can talk to animals in order to predict who will win the rat races charlie claims that he will help the little cutie find her a family but in reality he is using her skills to win fortunes at the race so that he can build a more elaborate casino of his own to bring carface down although he refuses to admit it charlie does grow to love annemarie br br the concept of the story isn't as problematic as the execution aside from the human girl annemarie and a flamboyant musical alligator who appears about three quarters through with the vocal pipes of ken page none of the other characters emerge as likable nor frankly are even worth caring about unfortunately that also applies to charlie in trying to make him an anti hero the script composed by more than ten writers only succeeds in rendering the character too unlovable as such the audience feels no empathy for charlie and worse his redemption at the end of the movie does not come across as convincing further damaging to the character is the disappointingly uncharismatic vocal performance from burt reynolds besides the lack of an endearing lead the movie's other problem is in the structure of the story the slowly paced plot jumps all over the place and makes a habit of throwing in extra scenes which serve no purpose but to pad out the movie's running time the aforementioned musical alligator who resides in a danky sewer infested with native rats seems to have been thrown in from nowhere as does a scene where charlie tries to show his generosity to annemarie by feeding a pack of pastel colored pups pizza the whole screenplay feels like a rough first draft a bit more polish could have made this a tighter impactful story br br matters are not helped by the lackluster musical numbers by charlie strouse and t j kuenster annemarie's song and the gator's ballad are the only good ones the latter in particular benefits from ken page's mellifluous vocal or the uneven voice cast as mentioned burt reynolds' stiff and lifeless charlie detracts from his already unlikeable character even further the only exception is a fiery confession to itchy about his true intentions toward the end dom deluise as itchy is pretty good but he's had better roles notably tiger in an american tail and jeremy in the secret of nimh ken page as mentioned is awesome in anything he does but his character has such a small part that his overall contribution is unremarkable at best similarly wasted are loni anderson as a collie who once sired a litter with charlie melba moore and charles nelson reilly judith barsi as annemarie is probably the only voice that comes across as truly memorable partially because her character is the sole legitimately likable one in this depressing and joyless show br br barsi aside the only real positive about all dogs go to heaven is the animation technically this film has some of the most imaginative visuals from bluth's team by 1980's standards that is particularly a frightening scene where charlie has a nightmare about ending up in a fiery underworld ruled by a gargantuan satanic canine demon if anything the movie is more of a triumph of animation than storytelling br br on the whole however i cannot recommend all dogs go to heaven as good entertainment even though i recognize that the movie has its fans and the climax does admittingly provide some energy and a moving conclusion the overall package is not in the same league as bluth's better efforts animation buffs will marvel at the lush artistry but by the time it's over all dogs go to heaven could very well leave a bad taste in your mouth
this movie has a very hard to swallow premise even by this genre's standards we are asked to accept not only that a record played backwards can bring a dead man back to life but that the record also contains hidden messages aimed specifically at one kid when the singer had no connection to the boy when he was alive and of course no way of knowing at whose hands the record would end up anyway the film is fun for a while but eventually the silliness and the pointlessness reign supreme if they were really trying to create a new freddy like horror icon they were way off the villain here has no personality no motivation and no variety 1 2
while the story of a troubled kid turning to boxing for self respect and anger management is hardly a new thing the story is given a fresh twist here when the protagonist is a girl instead of a boy br br diana has trouble at school she just can't stay away from fighting at home her father is constantly putting her down her brother trains boxing at a gym and one day when she picks him up she decides she also wants to train br br it would be easy to call this movie a rocky with girls i guess but that is not at all what this is about the story actually benefits very much from the main character being a girl rather than a boy that way you can deal with more problems at once first the problem of her not being accepted because she's not a girlie girl and then when she comes to the boxing gym because she's a girl at all it's also a story about how a purpose can change someones life how positive things can make you grow i don't want this to sound pretentious because the movie doesn't feel pretentious at all but what i'm saying is true br br also michelle rodriguez is very good in the lead it's a shame really that she has become stuck in the tough girl typecasting now because that's really not what her part in girlfight is all about sure she's a female boxer but rather it's the more sensitive moments that really makes her shine br br so maybe this is basically your average underdog story with a twist but it's lifted way above the crowd by rodriguez' performance i rate this 7 10
i must say i was impressed the cinematography was amazing the frames close to perfection and the way he built up the tension around a subject that sound more like a dreadful bore is beyond be br br the film is about two narrators one seen one unseen they are both trying to explain the significant of a series of painting that caused a scandal a long time back the film is all about theories and explanations of views but the conclusion is quite shocking i must say definitely a film that deserves more than it's 171 votes br br with only 66 minutes to play out it's plot the film still felt like a complete work fantastic direction i must say far better than blood of the poet which it for some strange reason remind me a bit of br br i suppose you can call it by the slang word artsy it's pretty much just a lot of professional talk about various theories and stunning visual effects but the crew and ruiz did pull it off at least for me an amazing film
no this wasn't one of the ten worst films of the 1980's but it certainly skirts the bottom 100 somewhere this movie looks like it was put on the shelf for two or three years and then released in 1981 how else would you explain special effects pre dating an american werewolf in london disco still being considered cool and ronald reagan not being the 40th president of the united states while we're at it let's not overlook those 1970's hairstyles in the 1950's and '60's i've seen more of that here than in happy days laverne shirley combined br br the one woman who elevates this movie to the so bad it's good category was the late great elizabeth hartman but just barely biff plays as miss montgomery the mousey high school teacher who becomes a sexpot a stereotype that's been done to death and is still being churned out by hollywood today but even as a hot chick she retains her mousey qualities her call for help is evidence of this she also looks much better as miss wimp seven bucks at the beauty parlor shot to hell she wasn't kidding br br this isn't to say that there aren't any good parts elsewhere they're just few and far between and i'm not just saying that because i like hartman incidentally teen wolf was better than this teen wolf too was better than this and that wasn't even so good br br
scary movie 2 is a let down to the scary movie franchise scary movie 1 3 and 4 were all good but this one was kind of boring and not very funny luckily they picked their act up after this one and made two more great scary movies br br this film is about a group of teens who get tricked by their professor into going to a haunted mansion for a night things start to go wrong and then they realize they have to escape br br this movie isn't horrible but they could have improved quite a few things it is a bit of fun and if you liked the other movies in the scary movie franchise then give this a watch but i don't think you will like it nearly as much
i read the novel 'jane eyre' for the first time back in 1986 it was round that time that i saw the bbc version with timothy dalton and zelah clarke it was an excellent version and very much like the book years later i laid eyes on this version and was horrified william hurt is totally miscast as mr rochester mr rochester is a passionate character where as william hurt portrays him as a block of ice the same goes for charlotte gainsborough it was like watching two zombies together this is story about love and passion but i couldn't see it in this version no back to the bbc version a wonderful time is guaranteed
if you've seen other movies like this they're probably better the omega man comes to mind to the studio's credit they avoided the sprawling unnecessary big budget technofest that typifies movies of this ilk additionally the set up and premise were excellent four people whose past is virtually irrelevant to us are trying to get away from an overwhelming infectious fatal disease what's bad is everything else i get tired of endlessly stupid careless wimpy ineffective arrogant characters in a movie that pretty much describes everyone in the movie at some point i rented it and found myself yelling at the tv repeatedly no don't do that why are you so stupid look out etcetera a true lack of character development is evident about halfway in a movie should give you a strong personal connection with at least some of the characters so that you actually care what happens to them this one does not also there should have been a longer more involving end to the movie as well
this movie is a crappy and forgettable sean connery vehicle the performances are generally crappy especially by capshaw fishburne and the usually solid ed harris connery seems miscast as a harvard academic the movie absolutely gets worse as it goes along it is a third rate mystery that becomes extremely contrived by the time it unravels the movie squanders an excellent supporting cast george plimpton also turns up in a minor role to add some gravitas to connery as they debate the death penalty the violence and the atmosphere pepper a third rate mystery thriller that is manipulation to the highest degree the scripting and direction are extremely poor connery's charisma and screen presence are the film's only virtue manipulative violent and ridiculous 2 10 avoid it
i usually start by relaying the premise of the film but before anyone makes any hasty judgments about my review let me preface it by saying that i'm someone who likes most films just check my other reviews alone in the dark is a film by director uwe boll whose film right before this one was house of the dead 2003 like alone in the dark it was also a film adaptation of a video game almost everyone hated it well i loved it i even gave it a 10 out of 10 my point in stating this which will surely turn some readers off immediately is that if even i hated alone in the dark there must be something wrong with it br br the premise who am i kidding attempting to state a premise for this film is about as easy as trying to balance the united states' budget but here it goes anyway some archaeologists discovered evidence of some lost american indian tribe the indian tribe apparently had discovered some means of broaching the second world which was evil in nature the bad stuff wiped them out but not before they could lock the door to the evil world and throw away the key later some scientist government researcher who had been experimenting with the paranormal and specifically this tribe decided to experiment on some kids to try to produce some kind of hybrid with the second world believe it or not everything up to this point and then some is told to us in a written prologue to the film it's just white text scrolling across a black screen with a voice over also reading it to us then there was something about the kids being in an orphanage but the government takes them back out and then a bunch of people are searching for archaeological relics and there are super humans roaming around and a bunch of military people are called in and on and on br br in fact the exposition never really stops it's like a neverending backstory from hell there are enough ideas here to fill at least 10 films maybe 25 but not one of them is presented in a coherent way to create one good film in addition to the mystical lost indian tribe and the superhumans we also get monsters that resemble a cross between alien and a werewolf worms that invade your body and turn into snake like aliens tunneling worms underground zombies starship trooper like wars evil scientists underground lairs gold mines spooky warehouses impalements big mostly unused museums government conspiracies golden trunks pulled out of the sea nuns explosions complex backstabbing plots a very ambiguous romance car chases home invasions kitchen sinks wait i can't remember if that last one was in the film even more amazingly amusingly in fangoria 240 producer shawn williamson was quoted as saying we're spending much more time on story being very meticulous about that tara reid called alone in the dark a smarter film br br let me not mislead anyone a lot of that stuff above might sound yummy to the potential audience for this film but the problem is that nothing has the slightest connection to anything else i usually had no idea what any setting's relation was to any other setting why we were there or what anyone was doing at least when each scene began it's just a random mishmash of settings and clichés as if director uwe boll had 250 unrelated ideas in a hat and pulled them out like lottery numbers then when he was done he and editor richard schwadel decided to cut the film by using dice then reassembled it by throwing the i ching sometimes the film plays like an extended director's reel which is a combination of short varied unrelated scenes that directors circulate to try to get work but perhaps that's being too generous i'm not sure boll would get work if this were his reel br br just as i tend to at least like most films i tend to like most actors and most performances it's very rare that i say that a performance was bad well tara reid was bad here and i'm someone who usually likes reid i don't know what happened for a large percentage of the film they just move her around the set like a prop they might as well have just bought a blow up doll that would have saved them money that they could have used for some cgi ghosts and vampires in castle and graveyard settings maybe they chose to move her around like a pretty piece of driftwood after they saw the dailies of her mumbling nonsense dialogue in a monotone that's usually reserved for entertaining mother in laws br br and speaking of that dialogue a lot of alone in the dark plays like a godzilla film without godzilla by that i mean that it's a lot of pseudo scientific gobbledy gook at least in godzilla films there's a campiness to it because they know how ridiculous it is and there's a big payoff in that we get to see godzilla destroy downtown and battle a giant gnat with radioactive death beams shooting from its eyes or something br br just what stephen dorff and christian slater are doing here besides overacting and filing lawsuits against their agents is difficult to say i can't say that i thought anyone in the film had a decent performance although maybe slater at least saw the cigar i think that's unprecedented for me br br still i didn't give this film a 1 there was some competent cinematography even if boll and schwadel made mincemeat out of it and the hard rock tunes over the end credits were good heck even the novelette prologue wasn't so bad i actually thought the film had promise at that point but this may just be the worst film i've ever seen with a budget of 20 million or more
if you ever hear these three words uttered to you joe don baker be afraid br br final justice is the low budget action movie based on a sheriff in a texas town named geronimo pronounced as heronimo he's an ugly slimy rude character who is on the hunt for a criminal in malta who killed his partner in texas his partner actually slumps down twice in the movie very bad editing joe don baker geronimo ends up in jail like 4 or 5 times in this movie making the plot go nowhere fast plus he shoots everybody like he's in the wild west i guess nobody told him it was the 20th century a woman cop is assigned to show him around malta who looks like elaine from seinfeld and she is the only one who can put up with the redneck she must be insane br br the strippers in the bar are the most entertaining characters in this movie their dancing is shown throughout the film and i began to bond with the sleazy women well at least it was better than watching geronimo try to dumb his way out of something the ending is flawed and somewhat predictable and i was happy it was finally over you'll never forget that last line of joe don baker from the movie br br it's so hard to imagine how he was in three bond movies very weird anyway if you're up for a laugh then see this one on mst3k sometime also i've heard his other bad movie among many mitchell mst3k version is being released on dvd by rhino i can't wait to see that
weak stale tired cliched wants to be basic instinct but misses opportunity after opportunity for fresh perspectives new insights insipid trite grotesque and without the possibly redeeming value of brevity oh wait it was only 90 minutes long it must have just seemed a lot longer i'd rather clean bus station toilets with my toothbrush than have to sit through this again i'm expressing an opinion here i guess this means i didn't like it
well worth watching especially with the nice twist of a journalist with integrity you are expecting a big fall down story line as grey owl is unmasked as a fraud but it is not to be and adds to the generally optimistic and uplifting theme and drama of the story and film br br this has to be brosnan's best performance to date he convinces admirably as the english boy playing indians the stand out scene is the return to his aunts where brosnan and the two elderly lady actresses make a wonderful scene full of feeling of nostalgia and a life lost with so little dialogue just with expressions and good direction perfect br br the story is so little known and the message so universal and all important it is a real pity this film did not get better recognition maybe in time it may become a bit of a classic and a sleeper i hope so br br well done dickie attenborough and cast
pinjar is truly a masterpiece it's a thought provoking film that makes you think and makes you question our culture it is without a doubt the best hindi movie i have seen to date this film should have been shown at movie festivals around the world and i believe would have been a serious contender at cannes all the characters were perfectly cast and urmila matkondar and manoj bhajpai were haunting in their roles br br the story the movie tells about partition is a very very important story and one that should never be forgotten br br it has no biases or prejudices and has given the partition a human story here no one country is depicted as good or bad there are evil indians evil pakistanis and good indians and pakistanis the cinematography is excellent and the music is melodious meaningful and haunting everything about the movie was amazing and the acting just took my breath away all were perfectly cast
what can i say about it it's another hollywood's horror flick with very high budget 80 million dollars not scary at all it offers us only a few thrills and one really creepy sequence with skeleton in the fireplace a lot of computer generated special effects and nothing more catherine zeta jones is beautiful as always lili taylor is also a good actress the architecture of the hill house is amazing all these monuments statues furniture delicious however i don't like the ending because it was so luscious check this one out and form your own opinion on it i give this picture 7 out of 10
this review applies for the cut of the film that's generally available as fury of the wolfman i understand there is an uncut version out there with additional footage and i would hope that it contained at least eight or nine crucial scenes that seem to be missing from the cut known as fury of the wolfman in short the movie makes absolutely no sense whatsoever it is utter nonsense and incomprehensible nonsense at that br br waldemar daninsky that venerable lycanthropic antihero portrayed by paul naschy in a seemingly endless series of films is apparently a normal guy who has just come back from a trip to tibet where he was attacked by a yeti somehow this has turned him into a werewolf daninsky is a doctor a scientist and an instructor at what appears to be a college one of his female colleagues ilona elmann is involved in a vague form of hypnosis chematodes a nonsense word used to refer to a bunch of wires attached to a victim's head ellman feels this will enable her to change the direction of the human brain naturally enabling her to rule the world provided she can get us all attached to those wires with no trouble br br elmann is also into werewolves because she kidnaps daninsky and takes him to her hidden laboratory she has a bunch of other people trapped there as well some of them look like gypsies and are chained up being in varying states of lucidity others are clearly hippies elmann feels that one day she may be able to help them be human again but in the meantime she controls them with her chematodes waldemar becomes her hairy hit man wandering around like a werewolf zombie that is until the filmmakers decide to use footage spliced in from another naschy werewolf film frankenstein's bloody terror don't ask at which point naschy's werewolf makeup changes considerably and he lurches around like an animal br br is this making any sense no good that's the film's saving grace it doesn't try and engage you on any kind of intellectual level it just goes full speed ahead with whatever nonsense dialogue or cheap horror movie sets it can muster up fury of the wolfman may be the best halloween party movie ever you absolutely do not need to pay attention to it and in fact if you do you will be completely confused
i really love the sexy action and sci fi films of the sixties and its because of the actress's that appeared in them they found the sexiest women to be in these films and it didn't matter if they could act remember candy the reason i was disappointed by this film was because it wasn't nostalgic enough the story here has a european sci fi film called dragonfly being made and the director is fired so the producers decide to let a young aspiring filmmaker jeremy davies to complete the picture they're is one real beautiful woman in the film who plays dragonfly but she's barely in it film is written and directed by roman coppola who uses some of his fathers exploits from his early days and puts it into the script i wish the film could have been an homage to those early films they could have lots of cameos by actors who appeared in them there is one actor in this film who was popular from the sixties and its john phillip law barbarella gerard depardieu giancarlo giannini and dean stockwell appear as well i guess i'm going to have to continue waiting for a director to make a good homage to the films of the sixties if any are reading this make it as sexy as you can i'll be waiting
prom night is shot with the artistic eye someone gives while finely crafting a lifetime original film you know the one this october lifetime takes a break from the courageous tale of a woman surviving insert disease name here to tell the somewhat creepy tale of a woman pursued by a stalker ex boyfriend it's dramatic  it's sappy  it's immensely dull it does nothing to further a genre tell an original story or strive for any sort of newness prom night shares this plight watching the killer poke holes in his victims we sit silently as they slump to the floor with not a drop of blood spilled it occurred to me that this was the cleanest killer in movie history br br our director is working with a fairly good looking killer so he is forced to pour on the camera angles to make him appear creepier think about matthew mcconaughey coming at you with a knife you'd probably go  oh good lookin guy is going to kill me naaaa not scary even for a second so the director throws schaech into shadows and over the shoulder in the mirror this mirror shot is repeated to the point of sickness as it practically becomes a fetish of the creator you'll get 15 jump scares in this film 2 of which made my date jump i might mention she is afraid of everything i'd also mention she decided to take a nap halfway through the film and at one point threatened to leave me br br as if this film were not disjointed enough it appears to be cut to shreds i'm not saying it looks like key points were left on the cutting room floor as the crew scrambled to salvage some semblance of a horror film i'm saying as the film moves from scene to scene you often get a jarring jump this is the kind of thing you'd expect when a film catches fire and a projectionist is forced to splice ends together cross his fingers and hope for the best the editor should be shot br br with a plot you can pack into two sentences one stray spray of blood an emo killer and the tension of a very special episode of silver spoons we're left with no reason to support horror this weekend  at least on the big screen in fact this is the sort of film that should be punished is it really that hard to make a scary movie was this crew even aware they were making a horror film a complete waste of my time and yours i bit the bullet to get you this review don't let my sacrifice be in vain don't go into the movie
this is a collection of documentaries that last 11 minutes 9 seconds and 1 frame from artists all over the world the documentaries are varied and deal with all sorts of concepts the only thing being shared is 9 11 as a theme very minor in some cases some of the segements are weak while others are very strong some are political some are not some are solely about 9 11 some simply use 9 11 as a theme to touch on human feelings emotions and tragedies that are universal some are mainstream while others are abstract and artistic this film has not been censored in any fashion by anyone so the thoughts that you see are very raw and powerful br br this is a very controversial film especially for conservative americans i think two segments might really tick off the right wingers one from egypt where a dead american soldier and a dead palestinian bomber come back as spirits another from uk which recounts the us backed overthrow of chile on sept 11 1973 which resulted in 50 000 deaths and horrible atrocities the segment from mexico was the most powerful recounting the fall of the towers and the resulting death in vivid fashion you have to see it to believe it br br even though the final product is uneven with some segments being almost pointless i still recommend this it's very difficult to rank this film because the segments vary all over the place some weak some very powerful i'm giving this a rating of 9 out of 10 simply because some segments were excellent and covered issues that usually get censored mexico segment uk segment japan segment egypt segment
many people have commented that this movie was nowhere near as good as the first well maybe it isn't to you however how does your child react to it well mine loved it more than the first br br disney movies of the past can sometimes be a little harsh for little kids for example bambi's mother getting shot this movie was really great for my sensitive little girl who likes humor and happy endings br br if you want to be snobby about what should be disney's standards based on the past skip this movie br br if you have a sweet little girl or soft hearted little boy you really want to please buy this movie and treat your small children this film is great as a bedtime movie for happy dreams instead of nightmares i'm happy with a movie that pleases my kid doesn't need to impress the parents all the time
sometimes a movie is so comprehensively awful it has a destructive effect on your morale you begin to really ask yourself what does it mean for our society that the standard is so terribly low can they honestly expect that we'll endure this many clichés and still be entertained br br of course it is still a hollywood mainstay to make the gun the major character plot device and the source of all conflict and resolution in films character needs a gun gets a gun can't do that because he has a gun puts his gun down first oh my god what are we going to do he has a gun he waves it around acting more malicious than real human beings ever do he pushes it in someone's face for 90 minutes shouting questions the hallmark of any conclusion will be the comforting sound of police sirens br br it's a real challenge to make such a tired hackneyed formula work again a film has to be very clever and well executed this one is neither it has no life and no personality and it will suck these components from you it will make you feel worse about living in the time and space that you do really who needs that so yes i'll say it i think this may well be the worst film i have ever seen anyone who was involved in the making of this sub mediocre soul killing trash should be publicly embarrassed for the disservice they've done to us all
the 1st season was amazing the whole idea of them adjusting to the island while mysteries were being explored and seen was just phenomenal filled with suspense tons of cliffhangers and an amazing plot i mean i love the whole idea of just seeing them get used to the island and then first seeing the smoke monster in the first episode really caught my attention from then on i was hooked the second season was right on par with the 1st season only a little better i absolutely loved the idea of the hatches and the dharma initiative the whole plot and sequences of season 2 were mysterious creepy and exciting i loved all the suspense surround others on the island but the dharma story really made season 2 amazing br br season 3 wasn't quite as good as 1 and 2 but nonetheless great i loved seeing the back stories of the others seeing their camp and seeing the mysteries further explored tricia tanak is dead is one of my favorite episodes this season while not as good was still breathtaking and fun but most of all exciting now the 4th season i had hopes for this season and the 1st couple of episodes we're good but then it really started to get boring and monotonous i mean i really despise the new rescuers such as miles and daniel the plot got old after the first couple episodes and most of all season 4 was stripped away of something which made lost a perfect series the mystery suspense comedy mixed in charlie gone and overall excitement also some of my favorite characters have left
the acting in this movie was superb but mixed with the truth about the condition of many africans in south africa made it heart wrenching it was good that the writer isolated boesman and lena from others run from their homes so we could share fully in their triumphs and defeats the conflicts they shared as they grew together and apart worth seeing when you put the movie in it's proper context
we have an average family dad's a famous rapper we have the rebelious teenage daughter the adopted white kid and the cute little kid and we have careless housemaid what show has had a housemaid like that do we have a messed up brady bunch yay when it first came out i thought it was really cool mostly because i was young the music was bad the raps were so bad and they were too g rated all of his raps were about his family and friends and problems the dad was kind of the danny from full house type of dad always gave the advice out but he wasn't a clean freak they had a house keeper for that remember the plots were basically lil' romeo was in trouble of some sort or not that's it oh and maybe some preteen drama yeah that stuff is good not really but its still a good show for kids but nikelodean could do better
the undoubted highlight of this movie is peter o'toole's performance in turn wildly comical and terribly terribly tragic does anybody do it better than o'toole i don't think so what a great face that man has br br the story is an odd one and quite disturbing and emotionally intense in parts especially toward the end but it is also oddly touching and does succeed on many levels however i felt the film basically revolved around peter o'toole's luminous performance and i'm sure i wouldn't have enjoyed it even half as much if he hadn't been in it
i just saw dreamgirls yesterday and i was really underimpressed despite all the oscar buzz this is nothing special anyone who was really impressed by this film has never bothered to see any of the true movie musical classics except for eddie murphy's great musical and dramatic performance dreamgirls is just a glorified tv movie with no style or flair just a bunch of amateurs singing at each other br br now the first half hour was good but i was irritated at how eddie murphy's terrific raveup performances were truncated and interrupted by montages those were easily the best songs and best performances in the film and the rise to the top portion of the film was the only part of the film that had a consistent point of view or any momentum the remaining hour and 45 minutes was a formless rambling mess that was neither realistic nor fantastic enough to be interesting it was also visually dull and included too many sound alike tunes br br condon didn't try to turn any of the tunes into big show pieces as i'd expected they would each number in the 2nd half was just one closeup after another of people singing at each other and the way they shot hudson's big love me number was criminal condon just shot her stomping around the stage no drama at all god it sucked br br and note to all involved that sing talking dialog stuff might work on stage but it does not work in movies see embarrassing failures of evita and phantom all that i'll teeeell youuuu something efff ieeee crap should have been left on the editing room floor those aren't songs br br again the film except for eddie murphy's amazing performance was nothing more than a glorified tv movie there must have been megabucks behind the pr work for this film i wonder how much money was spent to give it that pre release one to beat oscar buzz as a whole this film was except for eddie nowhere near an oscar caliber movie except for eddie i'd rank it right up there with grease 2 big disappointment especially after all the very expen i've hype
i must admit that this is the type of film that i would normally eschew but i rented it basically because of the stars i certainly was not sorry in fact as you see i rated it five stars this film is the perfect combination of sharp directing and superior acting br br andy and hank hanson are brothers who decide to commit the uncouth crime of robbing their parents' jewelry store the crime goes terribly wrong thus beginning an examination of the three men in the hanson family through a series of flashbacks we get to know charles hanson and come to an understanding of the strained relationship between father and sons br br younger brother hank is basically a screw up he has always had trouble holding a job and pretty much goes in the direction of the wind hank is insecure cowardly and very much under the influence of his big brother ethan hawke has the character of hank nailed to a t and gives what is probably his best performance thus far he shows us a man who is basically good hearted but so influenced by outside forces that he is unable to follow through with any important task br br andy on the surface appears to be a successful businessman but we soon discover that he is addicted to drugs and has been embezzling from his company to pay for his habit it is andy who concocts the scheme to rob his parents' store and he gets weak willed hank to commit the act philip seymour hoffman surely one of the finest actors of our time plays andy hoffman is an actor who has the ability to portray a man who on the surface is a charming businessman liked by his acquaintances but a real slime ball underneath he is absolutely perfect for the part of andy or it might be said that he through his superior acting skills made andy the perfect part br br albert finney plays a father common to his generation charles hanson is not a bad or unfeeling man but he has a lousy relationship with his sons because he never really understood what was necessary in nurturing a positive bond between his sons and himself he has always been too quick to criticize and admonish he always made it clear that he favored his younger son over his older thus causing a wide emotional rift between himself and andy as we get to know charles and andy the thought of andy forming a plan to rob from his father becomes less unbelievable br br on a personal note i cannot believe how much charles hanson reminded me of my own father and how much andy and hank reminded me of my own brother and myself perhaps this may be one of the reasons that i enjoyed the film so much as this story of a distant critical father a more successful older brother and a less successful younger brother hit so close to home fortunately my brother and i never came to the state of committing a crime against my parents guess we were made of sterner and more moral stuff br br this complex of personalities and actions has been expertly put together by director sidney lumet at eighty three he still has the chops to give the audience engrossing characters and edge of seat action that hypnotizes 12 angry men was his first film made fifty years prior to before the devil knows you're dead but he hasn't lost any bit of his magic touch in showing us characters that will be long remembered br br the events and characters in before the devil knows you're dead are harsh and unattractive and this is definitely not a feel good movie however it is two hours of ultimate entertainment which i thoroughly recommend

hitler the rise of evil was shrouded in controversy before it ever aired and that controversy may obscure the accomplishment of the film br br those who criticzed the film which they hadn't seen did so with good intentions based on the misguided thought that it would be overly sympathetic to hitler however they misunderstood the point to humanize the evil hitler is not sympathize with him it is far more disturbing to realize that the unspeakable acts committed by one of history's greatest villains were committed by a human being a sick diseased maniac to be sure but a human being nonetheless it is necessary to know the story of how hitler was able to come to power to prevent it from happening again br br rise of evil is highlighted by a brilliant career best performance from robert carlyle who makes hitler a human being without ever redeeming him in any way carlyle flawlessly captures the look and mannerisms of the nazi leader while never letting the impersonation become cartoonish or distance us something anthony hopkins was not quite able to accomplish when he portrayed hitler in the bunker another very good made for television film while were are repulsed by hitler's depravity and virulent ant semitism carlyle gives him a certain magnetism and power the real adolf hitler must have possesed after all while else would a nation have followed him br br of the various subplots by far the most compelling features matthew modine as reporter fritz gehrlich who makes it his life's work to draw attention to the reality of of hitler and nazism while modine's performance is a little stilted in part 1 by part 2 he seems to have settled in the character gives us a real life hero in a film full of villains peter stormare and liev schrieber also give strong support br br part 1 of this two part mini series suffered a little bit from being overly choppy including a look at hitler's childhood which lasts only the duration of the opening credits and in part 2 sections detailing hitler's relationship's with his niece and his mistress eva braun are less successful than the central plot but do serve to give us further insight into his mental and emotional state br br ultimately no film about hitler can make us understand him the average person is thankfully incapable of ever understanding a man who would try to exterminate an entire race of people hitler the rise of evil tries less to make us understand hitler and more to make us understand how he came to be power it is an important story that must be told and it is impossible to believe anyone who has seen the film would accuse it of having anything but the best of intentions and the capability of doing anything but good br br 9 out of 10 1 2
i am writing this after just seeing the perfect son at the 2002 gay and lesbian mardi gras film festival in sydney australia br br when their father dies two estranged brothers meet at the funeral and after discovering that one of the brothers is dying from aids they enter on a heart warming journey of reconciliation the two leads do a magnificent job of creating the gradual warmth and respect that builds up between them as the movie progresses i do have one qualm about the movie though whilst the brother who is dying acts sick he doesn't look it a person of 0 t4 cells would look quite ill not even a make up job to make the actor look ill was employed a small gripe but one that makes it a bit less realistic despite that one small gripe the perfect son is a wonderful movie and should you have the chance to see it do i'm hoping for a dvd release in the near future
what surprised me most about this film was the sheer audience it attracted similar films such as anita and me have never caused as much hype as this film has though i think that's probably because of the mention of 'beckham' in the title more than anything else br br it's a brilliant film putting across a brilliant message you can do anything if you're determined enough and put your mind to it which is such a positive message to anyone watching this film br br i think this is one of keira knightley's better films and i think she's a brilliant actress and was excellent for the role parminder nagra was brilliant too sadly i can't say this for jonathan rhys meyers because i don't think that he was that much of a good actor and to be honest his eyes were a little scary br br all in all a brilliant film and a brilliant story
all i can say is first movie this season that got my attention i picked it because of the actors gere and claire and the story looked promising i have just watched it and i can say i'm overwhelmed there are shocking scenes true but that's what makes it more realistic we shouldn't run away from our reality these things are happening right this moment and there are experts who are trying to change things and make things better and who get laughed out about their commitment to the cause actually i can't seem to feel the hollywood touch in the movie and that's what makes it better both claire and richard did a great roles and deserve a 10 from me
i myself am a big fan of low budget 80's horror films this isn't the worst but still not to spectacular the plot line is decent but drags out way too long you're through half the movie before you even get to see any zombie action the kills aren't very creative and the zombies aren't too crafty i truly think this movie would have been better if they left out the zombies and just made it into some mafia flick it's watchable but i feel that this film did steal at least an hour of my life i'll give the film credit for being somewhat original if you are really into b horror movies it's worth a viewing but if you're not don't bother but you don't have to take my word for it
page 3 is one of those films madhur bhandarkar makes to expose societal filth the film is compelling but like most of bhandarkar's films it is one sided and overly pessimistic this film is all about tabloid journalism gossip celebrities the film exposes the lives of socialites whose lifestyle is disastrously boastful peculiar and repulsive they party they care for nothing but fame they plan parties at funerals they are craving for more money and a higher reputation they will do anything to get due exposure in the media to get their names boldly printed on the daily newspaper's social column known as page 3 with huge photographs which will be the center of people's discussions they are attention seeking salacious and hypocrite the film industry is shown as sleazy with casting couch being a common phenomenon among filmmakers that's where our lovely heroine a young social column reporter madhvi sharma is thrown all these people from mumbai's elite depend on her articles and she is the right person to befriend at these parties if you want her to mention you in her article later in the film we learn that even those who are madhvi's friends are no different from these high society people this was tough viewing for me although the film is unquestionably brave and the issues it deals with are interesting br br the film's music is average the only passable songs are kitne ajeeb and huzoor e ala sung by the two melody queens lata mangeshkar and asha bhosle respectively otherwise the soundtrack is bad one song which was particularly horrendous is filmy very filmy the film's writing is quite good the second half is far better than the first as it turns more matter of fact and exposes much more important issues such as terrorism and child abuse that's where the film has to be applauded it was sad to know that people prefer to ignore such crimes out of fear and konkona sen sharma's character's disappointment was very easy to relate to she was excellent throughout the film and her acting in the last few scenes was particularly impressive atul kulkarni's part was very small but he did full justice to it boman irani is solid as the newspaper's editor sandhya mridul is lovable as madhvi's sassy roommate pearl who marries an older man for money and is honest enough to admit it the film's ending is really well done and provides a certain sigh of relief after the unimaginably tough proceedings page 3 is a good film it is interesting and at times moving but the level of its interest and its general quality are marred by its exaggerated overly messy and negative portrayal of the rich and famous
the basic hook here is lincoln is slow it is his slowness that represents his thoughtfulness and deliberation making him a great leader who is here engaged in single handedly civilizing the american frontier through the grand instrument of law all that john ford hooey and more including one lurking slave and extraneous death by injun however the 'slow' conceit is also at the center of one brilliant piece of movie making funny and moving at extremes the history may be bunk but the telling of it suggests a view of history as process that inspires some excitingly true seeming moments check out henry fonda's big introductory stroll across the deck his shockingly beautiful second visit with his girl by the river his dalliance with mary todd on the porch and the priceless business that follows 'ma'am we've got to hurry ' things do thin out once we settle into the big courtroom drama but fonda is priceless throughout
if there were two more charming performers than peter ustinov and maggie smith appearing together in a more charming movie in 1968 i don't know who they were i first saw this delightful little satiric gem 25 years ago at the age of 16 and i consider any year in which i have failed to sit down to watch it again a wasted one it's intelligent quirky neat wistful sweet gently subversive and utterly enchanting the romance of these two social misfits is both richly comic and terribly moving never more so than in maggie smith's desperate attempt to bring up the right card in the deck a scene that's both ruefully funny and a perfect thumbnail portrait of heartbreaking loneliness and that final freeze frame on the anxious concerned loving face of ustinov as he asks are you all right has anyone ever made the look and sound of devotion so perfectly and nakedly honest i would never want to know anyone well who didn't love this movie
my title above says it all let me make it clearer if you have seen the bbc's planet earth which i am sure most of you have then you are not gonna like this movie too much and i own all the discs of planet earth i had seen the rating for this movie very high and read good reviews about it i was excited to check it out br br alas i went to the theater and the movie started i saw it was a disney movie with production companies listing bbc and discovery and when they started the first scenes about the polar bear i recognized them from my dvds at home of planet earth br br the movie continued and went on and on and on me and my friends kept on recognizing the scenes were all from planet earth br br we were very very disappointed as i think 90 of the footage is from planet earth i am saying 90 because some of the scenes i didn't recognize i have a feeling that i simply didn't remember them br br so finally what this movie really is is a compilation of different footages from the different discs of planet earth with a narration aimed at kids yes the narration is quite kiddish let me give you an example when they show the polar cubs walking away from the mother cub the narrator says the polar cubs are not like human kids they don't always listen to their mothers i don't remember the exact words but this is how it is so in a nutshell this is condensed planet earth for kids
time and time again i've stated that if people don't want remakes or sequels made they should stop seeing them and instead venture into the world of independent film having said that though the last time i saw an independent film myself must have been easily six months ago so here's a review for an indie that i had my attention drawn to on youtube the cure br br right away you can tell that the film is going for an avant garde film approach which is telegraphed in its use of extreme close ups scopophilia and fast editing it is proud of the way it looks and it has a right to be for the most part it is a very nicely composed little piece save for one inexcusable disregard for the 180 degree rule and a comically bad gunshot effect which is a phenomenon that seems to be the calling card for self funded projects br br still despite these amateurish mistakes the majority of the shots are actually a pleasure to look at we're presented with a good use of props and locations good visual acting and some very atmospheric fluid editing which is made more commendable as this is definitely something you won't see very often at all from a youtube submission the plot is fragmented and although the basic premise is fairly simple some may find it hard to follow exactly what is happening but what we are seeing here is avant garde storytelling at work you can't really expect a straightforward three act structure and if you do you might not be ready for this kind of movie br br where the film is unfortunately let down however is the sound what you're going to hear throughout is a distorted voice over which often sounds insincere and worse still is the continuous background music which goes through minimal change and doesn't add much to anything so much attention is paid to the visuals that the audio frankly sounds neglected and this becomes really apparent when you realize you've just missed about four sentences of the narration and have to backtrack to pick up what slipped past your attention br br so give it a watch but do it with the sound turned off br br last thought was anyone else reminded of the cover for doug naylor's red dwarf novel last human early in the film if you have the book you know what i mean
this movie is a blatant attempt by the left in hollywood to portray reagan's administration as incompetent and bungling some mistakes may have been made at the time of the crisis but i'm sure not to the extent portrayed in this lame movie my first reaction was that this movie had to have been directed by oliver stone but i was wrong this time there are apparently many others
faces are slashed throats are cut blood squirts and in end the three main characters are either depressed or they die they even blow up kevin costner's dog with a shotgun why would anyone want to see a movie like this violence is valid only when the good guys kill the bad guys not the other way around take for instance underworld and underworld evolution where you can enjoy seeing justice done when the demons are slain in this movie the good guys are cut up see the difference why would anyone want to make a movie that depresses the audience beautiful photography and skilled editing in a motion picture like this is a waste of talent let's put this one into the category of the exquisite corpse
bromwell high is nothing short of brilliant expertly scripted and perfectly delivered this searing parody of a students and teachers at a south london public school leaves you literally rolling with laughter it's vulgar provocative witty and sharp the characters are a superbly caricatured cross section of british society or to be more accurate of any society following the escapades of keisha latrina and natella our three protagonists for want of a better term the show doesn't shy away from parodying every imaginable subject political correctness flies out the window in every episode if you enjoy shows that aren't afraid to poke fun of every taboo subject imaginable then bromwell high will not disappoint

writers perry and randy howze crafted a very engaging little story in chances are br br using the idea of a reincarnated man who happens to return to his former wife's home many years later the plot takes unexpected delightful turns br br twenty four year old robert downey jr renders a delightful performance ably assisted by cybil shepherd as the widow and ryan o'neal as a good friend br br this trio has just the right chemistry for this caper playing off one another with a graceful style i've watched this film a number of times on tv and each time found it most enjoyable
wow how bad can it get this was seriously bad not in terms of the gore which was mainly laughable cgi but in acting atmosphere and direction br br the story was dreadful the character arc of the main lead was a total joke within a few nights of stalking vinnie jones he starts to become 'haunted' to the point of crying when photographing his girlfriend um are all new york photographers this childish suggestible and weak his character development had absolutely no justification or point whatsoever and by the very end you'll be laughing out loud at the utterly predictable and totally absurd twist his character takes br br the gory moments were clearly just a weak low self esteemed effort to jump onto the modern mtv style gore wagon all cgi blood yet no real emotion whatsoever these parts were unintentionally funny and distracting by their self consciousness wacky camera angles etc br br overall this film commits the crime of blowing another potential idea what could have had atmosphere until the stupid monsters at the end is ruined in favour of 'look at me'style self conscious directing this film wasn't made for and audience it was made for a cv a deeply selfish motive
i am so confused what in the world was this movie about what was the killer's motivation he seemed quite angry but i have yet to figure out why nothing in this movie made sense it had zero depth or less than zero depth which i guess would make it a hill or a pile of crap the acting was horrible when i searched for a few of the actors in this movie they had been in very few things that i had heard of and that came as absolutely no surprise i can't decide whether to feel sorry for them for the embarrassment of being in a movie this bad or to feel that they should never be offered another acting job again starting now seinfeld reference really though don't waste your time with this there's so little substance that there's nothing there even just to make fun of this was undoubtedly one of the worst slasher flicks no one of the worst flicks of any kind that i have ever had the misfortune to watch and i've seen quite a few
this film was so predictable that during the entire time you're hoping that the obvious suspect is innocent and there's some other big twist still coming however it doesn't he just continues to act creepy and she continues to ignore it mary found very incriminating evidence at his place and she still trusted him and what was that baiting the trap there was no trap she confronted him he said excuse me i have to go kill someone he left and that was the end of it they make attempts to use other suspects like that one older carnival girl at the end but they're completely underdeveloped actually all the characters are underdeveloped they have no depth and the setting is just plain strange who hangs out in a recycling factory its choppy and nothing is well developed for example when she leaves his place after having the beer and he finds the pics and she runs out and he catches her and they end up having sex in that car what was that her reactions weren't portrayed in the car she acted scared like it could have been practically rape but then all we see is her showering the next morning booooooooo it could have been so much better sooo much better
lesbian vampire film about a couple on holiday who are staying on the grounds of what they think is an empty manor house but is really being used as a pair of lesbian vampires as the vampires bring in the occasional victim the couple go about their business until the two groups come crashing together br br great looking film with two very sexy women as the vampires there is nothing beyond the eye candy that they provide to recommend this cult film yes its a sexy vampire story no it is not remotely interesting beyond the women to be honest there is a reason that i've been seeing stills of this film in horror books and magazines it looks great but other than that br br for those who want to see sexy vampires only
i had never heard of this one before the owner of my local dvd rental outlet mentioned it to me being a 1980s horror flick with the notorious distinction of having been banned in the u k i decided to check it out the film turned out be a dull amateurish and ugly looking ride the sound recording is so poor that dialogue is unintelligible half of the time whereas the acting gives new meaning to the word inept br br what’s worse the film follows the awfully tired formula of a trio of teenage girls being involved in an accident and finding themselves sheltered by a dysfunctional family living in remote surroundings soon one of the girls goes to look for help and is never heard from again another still bed ridden is quickly disposed of after being forgotten for most of the duration the heroine is the one to interact the most with the three inhabitants of the house a harridan of a bible thumping mother cue horrendous overacting her repressed and long suffering daughter and the latter’s weirdo brother who occasionally appears on the scene to drool over the sleeping female guests br br often resorting to dinner table reminiscences by the man hating mother as a means of filling in the dreary to say nothing of unoriginal backstory and which invariably develop into mother daughter sparring contests the film does have one ace up its sleeve – the twist ending is as unexpected as it is ingenious but it does little to remove the bad taste left in the mouth by the film as much through the lameness of it all as the intermittent gore or the inescapable feeling of having wasted 80 minutes of my time
ok at the beginning it looked like shrek the loner that is persistently followed by the comic relief then it evolves into something really compelling as the gauntlet is set and the result is an enjoyable movie which has moments that i agree that are a little too dramatic for kids to watch manny's past for example the premise has been obviously worked for a long time so that they can suceed in making a movie set with almost no different sets only ice caps and rocks and three characters it's a good thing to know that they succeed in doing something emotional out of it as i said it can be tear jerking at some times so kids be warned the real letdown is the animation this wasn't so souped up like the toy story movies or shrek and it shows the humans are unrealistic and we have seen better examples of cgi before but don't let this stain the record as a solo effort ice age is commendable and it will gather many fans i have no doubt oh and yes the moments with that small mouse are priceless and show stealing
whatever happened to british tv drama from john major through tony blair the focus of the genre appears to have shifted from social realism to smugly normative women focused tales about the piddling domestic problems of nice middle class professionals br br or perhaps tvnz doesn't buy the good stuff please let that be what it is br br the writer's long career in soaps probably explains why the dialogue is made up mostly of stale clichés niamh cusack's performance is strong on meaningful looks each held by the director for at least half a dozen beats longer than they deserve baleful looks however are a poor substitute for depth of character if the writer has failed to provide such material for actors to work with br br of course this is theoretically a thriller about a murder investigation but that's not as important as the central character's failing marriage and its attendant problems is cusack's character's husband a complete bastard will her son be utterly traumatized by the marriage break up making these the central issues isn't a sign of insight it indicates a profoundly narcissistic identification by the writer and director with a character who should be getting on with her job br br lynda la plante knows how to write this stuff so that it feels as if it matters and involves viewers other than housebound neurotics evidently paula milne isn't up to the task
war inc is a funny but strange film the actors are likable the film is likable also but i don't know how to describe the plot i will go into the plot later on this is a movie with some weird casting choices besides john cusack as a hit man which we saw years ago in grosse point blank which i liked br br here we have hilary duff playing a russian pop star named yonica babyya or something like that her character is odd there is a scene where she sticks a scorpion down her pants and hits on hauser cusack there is a twist in the end involving the two characters it makes sense br br that is the only casting choice i am going into cause it just plain strange the whole movie is strange but at times incredibly funny and i was never bored here we have some of the best actors out there excluding miss duff she ain't great but here we have john cusack marisa tomeii joan cusack ben kingsley see what i mean br br this is the story of a hit man named hauser cusack he is sent down to some middle eastern city to put a hit on an oil man named omar sheriif not the actor while trying to deal with his own personal problems he has to help out the wedding of a popstar played by hilary duff and he falls in love with a news reporter played by marisa tomeii there is a thing about the popstar though hauser is disgusted by her there is a scene where she is singing a song to him and afterwards he throws up br br the twist in the end of the film reveals kind of why the thing about the twist is that i did kind of see it coming but that doesn't matter this is a strange funny and entertaining comedy i love most of the actors so really how could i not recommend it br br war inc 3 5 5
it's a bad movie it seems like there is only 5 police in hk they were not using there gun and this makes me feel like a jacky chan's movie all the time they were using their gun to point at the suspect only when they finally use their gun is when they kill each other what a funny movie in the movie it's like all the good guys died without a reason br br they story line of the movie also sucks the story jump here and there and bored people but if you wanted to see a bloody movie i think this is only a ok type of movie i think u s made zombie movie is more bloodier than this one
baby face is a fast paced wise cracking knowing smirk of a film that br br lasts only an hour and 15 minutes but oh what a smart 75 minutes they br br are that a story that covers so much ground could be told in such a br br short time puts most of today's movie makers to shame screenwriters of br br today should study the economy of baby face and cut the bloat that br br overwhelms so many of their films br br the story is no nonsense an amoral woman rises to wealth first under br br and then over the bodies of the men who fall madly in love with her br br sure the production code loused it up with a redeeming happy ending br br but it isn't hard to see in which the direction the writers wanted to br br go so enjoy what's there and use your imagination for the rest stanwyck is terrific as is george brent and douglass dumbvrille as a br br hapless suitor not a great film but certainly an enjoyable one if br br you've never seen baby face catch it the next time it's shown on cable br br or rent the cassette it's worth the effort
how many centuries will pass until the japanese asian horror films abandon the long haired ghost woman shtick admittedly they've managed to rip off ringu a million times and often it worked well which just goes to show that originality isn't that much of a requirement in the horror genre or that i'm very uncritical and easy to please however this time around i found myself a little restless somewhat bored it's not a bad film but it's at least half an hour longer than it should be with its absurd 110 minutes length compared to many other japanese horror films omc lacks atmosphere and excitement plus the ending is confusing it makes no sense at all as for the ring tone miike could have come up with a melody that is more effective than that forgettable little thing even though it was played a dozen times i can't even remember it that's how scary it was speaking of miike for him this is something of a commercial venture so if anyone thinks they might be getting perversion of the bijita q or audition kind they're wasting their time
ok i own this dvd i got it new at amazon i mean i think its badass and a pretty cool flick and melissa bale the slutty bitchy girl they pick up is hot as hell the acting sucks and the whole polt just sucks the clown is some huge guy wearing a mask and its disgusting but its ok i wouldn't recommend it if like u wanted to rent a good entertaining flick after a hard days work but if u have nothing else to do and ur obbsessed with this stupid movies like i am watch it sometime and i do not know how artisan dvd has s i c k in its dvd collection s i c k is not good enough to be owned by a half way decent movie company ok well thats all
the creativeness of this movie was lost from the beginning when the writers and directors left out a good story line only to substitute with horrible special affects this movie seemed to be focused on amusing children but couldn't even accomplish that many small low budget films have the potential to become great movies but this movie is no where near that fortunately this will be another film easily made and easily forgotten this movie was probably a chance for the actors to make a little money on the side until their chance came along for a real role in a good movie anyone who has a shred of respect for films should avoid seeing this movie at all costs
this is the story of two guys who found a copy of 'funky monkey ' finding this seemed odd at the time figuring that there are still posters for the movie at the local cineplex odeon after seeing such classics as 'every which way but loose' and 'project x ' these two guys figured movies with monkeys are awesome br br these guys were in for a long ride as they watched this movie there was some monkey that was replaced by a stunt man when action sequences were required it was apparent that the monkey wasn't trained in the school of shakespearean acting perhaps replacing the monkey with ben affleck might have helped the guys thought br br maybe a strong sidekick would help like a jackie chan or heck maybe even hulk hogan luckily this movie had amazing martial artist and jet li look a like matthew modine while some might argue that matthew modine doesn't come close to jet li camera tricks prove that he is every bit as good when it becomes obvious that an untrained chimp can't handle the movie the movie leans on matthew modine to be the real star br br did i mention that there is some dorky kid that develops a bond with modine and the monkey is there a possibility that the kid learns confidence and even picks up a girl in this movie even matthew modine should get jealous with this one because using the pick up line 'i'm second fiddle to a monkey' doesn't seem to work with the ladies br br shortly after watching this movie the two guys got a phone call from matthew modine telling them 'seven days '
i thought i was going to watch a scary movie and ended up laughing all the way throughout the movie in the scene where the human transformed to a werewolf i thought they was kidding todays computer games have ten times better animations low budget is a fitting comment i would recommend wolf 1994 with jack nicholson for a good werewolf movie it has good special effects as they should be human transforming to werewolf unless you wish to have good laugh i would not recommend you to watch this movie this movie is a joke
this is a weak sequel it lacks the interest and light touch of the magnificent man called horse in nearly every aspect and when compared to each other they hardly seem to be the same genre br br the return is almost a parody of the first and tries to evoke different indian ceremonies but comes across as trying way too hard to bottle the magic of the first in this film the tribe is lost and abandoned having lost their homelands modern life has encroached on paradise and they are living in abject misery and poverty perhaps this is the point the first film took us to a place where we would want to be a simpler time this takes us to broken indians in a miserable world and the white man is the hero and savior which rather negates the whole idea of the film br br the beauty of the first lay in the fact that the white man learnt and discovered that real civilization lies in values rather than western materialism in the second film this is all but lacking and so we end up with a weak film br br a huge disappointment
the first and second seasons started off shakily with good episodes sandwiched in between average ones and at times resorting to clichéd stories but once it started to set up the universe in which it exists and started to develop it's characters more it became a lot more fun and entertaining br br the main reason this show succeeds it because of four men richard dean anderson peter deluise joseph malozzie and paul mullie richard's dry sense of humour makes to show so much better peter's directing is excellent and makes any episode so much more entertaining and joe paul never fail to make a funny interesting episode together br br once you understand what the show is about and get to know the characters i doubt you won't like the show for those getting into the show i suggest the episodes 'the other side' a good serious episode and 'window of opportunity' a classic comic relief episode
four teenage girls in a suburb of los angeles get into all kinds of trouble parties drugs cops mixed up parents older boyfriends jodie foster sort of the mother hen of the pack tries keeping everyone together like a family like the family unit she's never had and the heartbreaking thing about the movie is that she can't slowly everyone grows up and goes away that precise plot point though underscored throughout is unfortunately tampered with did we really need a long sequence with scott baio outracing a car full of thugs on his skateboard or an even longer sequence also with baio where foster has a strange soliloquy about the pain of illusion some of the dialogue in fact is downright loopy and i didn't much care for an edit late in the film that segues clumsily from a death to a wedding but these are nitpicks in what is basically a very sensitive story about the loss of a tight bond and jodie's face at the ending speaks volumes if viewers do get choked up at the end the movie has earned this it doesn't pander for tears or ask for sympathy it shows us an example of friendship and hopes we understand from
there's so little here of the fantastic anne rice book that what is here makes no sense some of the characters intense and surprising characters don't make it to the screen at all and those who do are watered down to the point that there's no reason for their existence br br where's the relationship between christophe and marcel where's the continued affair between marcel and juliet why does dolly rose appear at all since her story's never explained where's the rape and redemption of marie whose greatest attribute and downfall is that she can pass for white and her marriage to richard why does the film end with marcel's beating at the hands of his father we learn nothing of aglae beyond that she's a bitch who hates her husband why no backstory explaining this hatred br br as for the performances there's not a one that's better than mediocre though that's likely due to the lousy script best of the lot is that of the actor playing richard but richard's not on screen enough to salvage the film worst is jasmine guy as dolly rose though again it comes down to the actress having nothing to do with what little she's given to work with br br all in all this is just terrible i thought it'd be impossible for any anne rice book turned film to be worse than exit to eden but feast of all saints makes that mess look like a critical hit how is it that rice is such a slut she'll allow her best works to become such junk on the screen
bravo to czechs their once powerful movie industry seems to awaken from post communist slumber br br the loners is a comedy done with all the elements you would expect to see in a modern hollywood production minus the garbage that seems to get attached to the genre over the past several years superb soundtrack excellent visual editing beautiful prague cityscape to mention but a few br br the story is actually comprised of several sub stories that frequently intertwain and overlap an is in essence a collage of destinies fates desires it follows a group of urban youth to mid thirties people through a variety of situations ranging from daily life and leisure activities to careers and obsessions and it is hillarious there's actually a point in the movie where the entire theatre i was in about a 100 people in a small art gallery laughed non stop for about 40 50 seconds how often do you experience that with modern hollywood productions br br although the entire main cast is excellent especially the upcoming macedonian star labina mitevska in the role of an immigrant facing the all too familiar hardships i have to single out jiri machacek for his superbly believeable portrayal of jakub a constantly stoned bohemian whose brain is severely affected by the stuff he smokes landing him in a plethora of funny situations br br conclusion don't miss this one it's got a lot to offer
hollow point though clumsy in places manages to be an extremely endearing and amusing action movie br br the primary entertainment value here is humor everyone turns in clever performances that provide the film with a great deal of energy br br oh by the way advocates of gun safety will be horrified by the conduct of the characters in this movie
jim belushi is having a mid life crisis nothing is going right when his car goes out on him he goes into an empty bar where michael caine shows him what life wouldve been like if one event in high school had come out differently a good premise with some moments but mostly flat and uninteresting on a scale of one to ten 3
i watched this with my whole family as a 9 year old in 1964 on our black and white tv i remember my father remarking that this is how it could have happened adam and eve i vividly remember the scene when adam finds eve her eyes were blackened i asked my father why were her eyes blackened and he told because she was tired and hungry having not seen this episode in 45 years i still remember it vividly the tv transmissions back and forth with the home planet scenes of bombs shaking the headquarters with the final scene of the two walking off adam carrying his pack and eve following it may not have been a theatrical work of art but it certainly left an impression on me all these years
i only watched this because it starred josie lawrence who i knew br br from whose line is it anyway the wacky british improvisational br br comedy show i was very pleasantly surprised by this heartwarming and magical gem it is uplifting touching and br br romantic without being sappy or sentimental the characters are br br all real people with real foibles fears and needs see it
eric rohmer's 'the lady and the duke' is based on the journals of an english aristocrat who lived through the french revolution but it's a stilted affair with its strange painted backdrops and mannered conversational tone most notably this portrait of age of terror takes place almost entirely at one remove from the real action one sees very little of ordinary people in this movie and little of the chaos poverty and terror that unfolded away from the drawing rooms of the persecuted but spoilt aristocratic classes the result is frequently dull and ultimately unenlightening about the forces that sometimes drive societies to the brink of destruction it's a disappointing film from an acclaimed director
i don't usually write a comment when there are so many others but this time i feel i have to i have spoken of taste in another review saying it's all in the eye of the beholder but when it comes to this film if you like it it simply means you have bad taste br br i love films i loved isle of the dead which is pretty much an unknown b w film i even liked scream and scary movie i liked these films because they have if not a lot at least something good about them i appreciate 99 9 of the films i've seen because they tell a story which i haven't heard before and most directors only make films with a good storyline throughout this film i was thinking where is this going even near the end where did they get these awful actors from was that supposed to be a joke and suchlike with the obvious twist looming i was sceptical but hoped it would perhaps make the film and prove i hadn't wasted my time i was sadly mistaken the storyline was bad to begin with and the twist actually ruined any glimmer of hope there was here's a rundown storyline  much like the first film which was alright this one is slow and sparse with no audience relation to the characters or the situations the situations are cringeworthy and shallow and completely boring and predictable the twist was terrible it didn't make me feel a thing like excitement or wow just my god there was nothing in the bulk of the film that you could look back to and think oooo wasn't that clever because it wasn't in fight club there are flashbacks at the end showing bits where tyler's true identity was cryptically shown and when you watched it again you saw more it really was a work of genius how it was written laid out and directed this was a meaningless attempt at an awesome twist i think it was wild things that had like a pretty poor double twist and i still liked the film because the rest was ok and it wasn't trying too hard to be a big twist its like the ci2 writer thought it was gonna be the best twist ever but really its just a bad story with a bad twist dumped on the end the film ended almost immediately afterward with the whole film void by sebastian's whole story build up meaning nothing and a horrible half forced paedophilic ending with a particularly young and innocent acting girl acting  the actors in this film are appalling almost as bad a sunset beach extremely corny and badly performed it's not even so bad it's good like hunk the worst acting i thought came from amy adams who played kathryn it was a rigid pathetic and badly thought out performance by her robin dunne was also poor i haven't seen american psycho ii yet but no doubt his laid back cool style has ruined that film also br br i can't even say it is a good film for teens as its not if my son or daughter liked this film i'd be ashamed but they wouldn't anyway as they would take into consideration all the things that make a good film which this film has none of really i'm disappointed that some have said you might not be in the age bracket for this film and so dislike it i like all the films now that i liked as a teen and had very good taste also do you really think that when you reach 20 you suddenly don't like any teenish story lines no i liked mean girls and other generic teen films and watch beverly hills 90210 all the time there's no excuse for poor directing acting and screenplay i'm afraid besides i was 16 17 when i first watched it if anything being older just makes you a better judge of a terrible film i can't believe anyone can give it 10 10 either one of my favourite films is memento and i gave it 9 as i know there can be better it is a shame for this site that people do that give 10s flippantly or don't get the films show and so give it 2 br br anyone who liked this film really should vary their taste and perhaps their lives and with this realise that this is the worst film ever made worse than loch ness br br if you aren't a teenager with bad taste or simply don't have bad taste you will absolutely hate this film
i absolutely loved this movie i bought it as soon as i could find a copy of it this movie had so much emotion and felt so real i could really sympathize with the characters every time i watch it the ending makes me cry i can really identify with busy phillip's character and how i would feel if the same thing had happened to me br br i think that all high schools should show this movie maybe it will keep people from wanting to do the same thing i recommend this movie to everybody and anybody especially those who have been affected by any school shooting br br it truly is one of the greatest movies of all time
i loved this film when i was little today at 17 it is one of my all time favorite animated films beautiful animation and appealing characters are just two of the things to like about this film although many people might not enjoy some of the songs most of them are well done and go along with the story it focuses on charlie a roguish handsome german shepard who may seem unlikable to some at first but eventually will win you over br br not a kiddie film by any means often very dark and frightening at times a treat for don bluth fans and animation buffs but do keep a tissue in handy adgth never fails to make me cry and will do the same for those who are movie sensitive arguably one of the greatest non disney animated films of all time along with watership down and my neighbor totoro br br bottom line a heavenly masterpiece
my room mate ordered this one off of the web a while back and i finally got around to watching it it is gross it is cheezy it is pretty dumb but it is also a lot of fun i mean this was the most fun we have had watching a movie like this since city of the walking dead ages ago it was like being at the old drive in theater again you could tell the guy who made this movie liked all the horrible dubbed zombie movies this one has all the cliches and tricks from those films rolled into one and it's neat because it is suppose to be like that the cheeze factor is high the gore flows and the laughs roll the effects go from sloppy to good with the one where the guy gets torn in half and the one where a guy gets his heart shoved through his chest both being excellent the acting goes from terrible to actually pretty good there is not much plot just lots and lots of gore this one is patterned after the zombie movies from italy and spain i think because they linger on the gross scenes forever like this movie if you like troma movies cheezy b grade stuff then you can do no wrong watching this one a nice way to waste a friday night
before i explain the alias comment let me say that the desert trail is bad even by the standards of westerns staring the three stooges in fact it features carmen laroux as semi bad girl juanita when you hear her mexican accent you will immediately recognize her as senorita rita from the classic stooge short saved by the belle br br in the desert trail john wayne gets to play the moe howard character and eddy chandler gets to play curly howard like their stooge counterparts a running gag throughout the 53 minute movie is moe hitting curly wayne's character a skirt chasing bully is not very endearing but is supposed to be the good guy br br playing a traveling rodeo cowboy wayne holds up the rodeo box office at gunpoint and takes the prize money he would have won if the attendance proceeds had been good the other riders have to settle for 25 cents on the dollar actually even less after wayne robs the box office no explanation is given for wayne's ripping off the riders and still being considered the hero who gets the girl br br things get complicated at this point because the villain al ferguson and his sidekick larry fine played by paul fix who would go on to play sheriff micah on television's the rifleman see wayne rob the box office and then steal the remainder of the money and kill the rodeo manager moe and curly get blamed br br so moe and curly move to another town to get away from the law and they change their names to smith and jones who do they meet first but their old friend larry whose sister becomes the 2nd half love interest senorita rita is left behind it the old town and makes no further appearances in the movie br br larry's sister is nicely played by a radiantly beautiful mary kornman now grown up but in her younger days she was one of the original cast members of hal roach's our gang shorts kornman is the main reason to watch the mega lame western and her scenes with moe and curly are much better than any others in the production as if they used an entirely different crew to film them br br even for 1935 the action sequences in this thing are extremely weak and the technical film making is staggeringly bad the two main chase scenes end with stock footage wide shots of a rider falling from a horse both times the editor cuts to a shot of one of the characters rolling on the ground but there is no horse in the frame the film stock is completely different and the character has on different clothes than the stunt rider there is liberal use of stock footage in other places none of it even remotely convincing br br one thing to watch for is a scene midway into the movie where moe and curly get on their horses and ride away to screen right from a cabin as the posse is galloping toward the cabin from the left the cameraman follows the two stooges with a slow pan right and then does a whip pan to the left to reveal the approaching posse outside of home movies i have never seen anything like this not because it is looks stupid which it does but because a competent director would never stage a scene in this manner they would film the two riders leaving and then reposition the camera and film the posse approaching as a separate action or if they were feeling creative they would stage the sequence so the camera shows the riders in the foreground and the posse approaching in the background br br then again what do i know i'm only a child
this documentary is a proof of talent being used for mean purposes the fact that it is financed by the venezuelan government gives it a lack of legitimacy in the purpose of searching for the truth of what really happened those horrible days of april 2002 in venezuela something even we venezuelans don't know for sure br br there are ways of lying and the directors of this stuff lie both by omission and by knowledge br br the venezuelan political process is too complex to be easily understood by foreign audiences and they take advantage of that for instance possible spoilers they show pro chávez demonstrators shooting at an empty street what the hell they did that for in a way of saying they didn't kill anyone but didn't bother showing the images we all saw here of opposition demonstrators and a journalist falling dead or injured at the other side of that empty street they can't explain why the chopper of the political police was the only one authorised to fly over caracas that day and did nothing against the snipers that were all over the roofs of the buildings nearby the presidential palace something that would exhibit how inefficient would be the security measures to guard the president a few days after the coup the chief of the military guard in charge was asked at the national assembly our congress why didn't they act against the snipers and he said 'cause they weren't there to act against the president isn't that a confession br br there is so much more the fact that the highest rank military announced that chávez had resigned and 2 days later he said he had lied because that's politics and nowadays is the minister of internal affairs of chávez' administration br br it would take me thousands of words to explain all the lies depicted in this documentary made with the intention of selling the world an image of the good old hugo chávez who rules for the poor and the bad rich opposition that wants him out at all costs when the truth is that 60 70 of people rejects his government and that percentage includes the poor br br i hope those of you who have seen and bought this will be able to see a different version that is being made by a group of venezuelan people showing no less than 30 lies br br nazi propaganda has returned
i seriously can't believe tim burton and timur bekmambetov two people i love signed on to produce this crap tim burton is a brilliant director but to be honest i've been losing interest in him for a while since his last few movies were either remakes or adaptations he did produce the brilliant nightmare before christmas which is one i've watched multiple times and directed movies like beetlejuice and sleepy hollow which are awesome films bekmambetov directed 3 films that i love night watch day watch and wanted i've only seen those three of his but they prove he's an awesome director br br those two people producing one of the many reasons i was excited to see 9 so today i went to go see it at the theatre i was so excited to finally have seen it i had waited 7 months for the movie to come out br br this movie is the first time i've walked out of a tim burton related movie and said i enjoyed almost none of that i felt heartbroken to even have felt that way i mean with him and bekmambetov at the production helm you'd have expected this movie to be a good watch right now i still can't get over how let down i was by this movie i hadn't even heard of the original short film before seeing it but now i can successfully say that this movie should have remained a short movie hell neil blomkamp made an awesome full length remake of alive in joburg entitled district 9 what was so hard to get right about 9 i really wanted to think this movie was awesome i really did but no it failed on so many levels br br the plot was extremely confusing and disjointed i had no idea what was going on let alone what it was about basically it's about a bunch of rag doll robots trying to save the earth well ok that's what i got from it but the writing here is extremely poor the whole film jumps around like a 6 year old with a d d telling a story there's this big giant clanky monster robot that 9 awakens causing destruction and stuff that's the main villain however what else is wrong with this movie is that everything comes out of nowhere there were too many monster robots most of which have no logical explanation behind them they have 0 development whatsoever i mean that flying pterodactyl like monster just rips out of nowhere we have no idea where it comes out of and acker just expects us to know what it is what was even more retarded was that snake like creature with the strobing eyes that hypnotize i dare you to give that description to someone else out loud and expect them not to laugh all of the 3 people i told about it burst out laughing oh and it wraps victims up and sews them inside it i'm not kidding br br the twist in act iii is the most retarded aspect of the whole movie so basically 9 goes back to the room he woke up in finds this box with a hologram from the scientist in it for 9 and he tells him that the big scary machine robot was designed to bring robot life to earth but then evil humans use it for war and it was supposed to help protect the earth but then the scientist gave his life to 9 so that it could help protect the world with it and he only mentions giving his life to 9 but what about the other robots who gave their lives to them this is the perfect example of poor rushed writing there's only one of the life taking device thingy that exists so how did the other 8 get life given to them the characters are not likable at all either they risk their lives for no reason at all the only good character is 7 6 annoyed me with his go back to the source ramblings 1 is an overpowering idiot 2 we don't know anything about 5 kept annoying me with his are you sure or can i stay here instead questions and that ending ugh i'm glad i'm not the only one who thinks that the ending was a huge wtf moment br br there's nothing redeeming about this turd except for its beautiful animation everything looks realistic and beautiful i love the gloomy and depressing look of everything however beauty can't save a good movie br br while it's true that this movie is very pretty looking pretty is as pretty does and 9 does squat i'm sure burton fans will be flocking to the theatre to see this movie without a doubt in fact with his and bekmambetov's names being thrown around the promos people will be flocking to the theatre to see this movie i know i may be making a big deal out of nothing but watching this movie made me realize how much i hate movies with unlikeable characters nonexistent plot and just pure style over content and this movie is one of those movies
i get it the diehl character is s'posed to be a microcosm of america itself seeing arab terrorists under every rock only to find out at the end that it's his own actions all along that got him into that siege state and truly if he practices good will to all men everything will be rainbows and lollipops sorry wim you have made amazing movies in the past that stay neutral of the politics and for good reason polemics are your weak point and they weaken this a well made amazingly filmed movie with absurd characters dialog and plotting better luck on your next flick another thing that yanked my crank was the belabored point of the homeless section of la being there for reasons of hunger these people don't get enough to eat truly these folks aren't eating regally but the real hunger these folks is a spiritual hunger an emotional hunger a mental hunger they need self respect self worth dignity which you can't give a man yeah those folks are hungry and if they need it it is available less the center for hunger in america i would say it's more the center for alcoholism drug abuse mental suffering and economic devastation dealing with hunger although a noble endeavor is band aiding a more profoundly systematic societal and age old human problem of homelessness bill diehl was good though and michelle williams was cute as the young yet cliched old soul
some of my favorite laurel and hardy films have very very little plot instead they give them a rather mundane situation and just let them be hilarious films such as help mates and busy bodies are among the funniest as you see the boys working or cleaning house here in dirty work most of the film is akin to these other two films stan and ollie are chimney sweeps and spend most of the film trying quite unsuccessfully to clean a crazy professor's chimney seeing ollie fall through the chimney the boys making the house a total mess and the insane behaviors of stanley all work together to make a very pleasing film br br however in an odd twist there is also a really weird subplot that begins and ends the movie it seems that the professor is truly a mad scientist and he is working on a formula to make things younger late in the film you see him make a duck into a duckling and even a duckling into an egg given that he then leaves the boys alone in the room is it any surprise what happens next while this subplot was unnecessary it worked well enough what worked exceptionally well was the middle portion give the boys nothing exciting to do and you'll be amazed at the hilarious results one of the team's better films and it almost earns a 9
we all knew even before it aired the ron moore mini series is no battlestar galactica that's fine it just means it must stand on its own it can't lean on battlestar galactica if it's any good it's good on it's own merits and ron moore has something to be proud of if reports are true this is what moore wanted however if his mini series rots he has shamed all the excellent actors that performed on screen not to mention the myriad off screen personnel and this is what he's done br br yes this mini series is no remake i wouldn't even call it a re imagining it's a new production inspired by battlestar galactica it does not take place in the galactica universe with the same places and jargon and technology it doesn't tell of the galactica's search for the thirteenth tribe nor does it rely on the legends and mysteries that underpinned galactica ron moore's mini series is a space opera action flick with a ceremonial nod to battlestar galactica br br maybe i should say just another space opera action flick because as plots go his has little that's original or even interesting i could relay the whole thing to you without a spoiler warning but i won't inflict that on you i'll just hit the most important point ready now here it is just watch the trailer it will tell you everything there is in the story br br yes creations of man turn on man and seek to destroy man i guess they forgot azimov's rules again they look like humans so there's the whole aliens among us thing at least there's no time travel oh and lots of fighting scenes and random acts of sex and violence the end result was that when moore did draw from galactica that ceremonial nod it came off more corny than respectful i mean couldn't he even think up anything of his own br br from the first few minutes i wanted to watch something else i didn't care about any of moore's characters since i couldn't identify with any of them this fact hit me in the face when the cylons began their attack armageddon on a planetary scale and i didn't give a damn how depressing br br moore's heroes when faced with an insurmountable obstacle instead of overcoming it rather tucked tail and saved their own butts after all it was the only way to save humanity yadda yadda yadda they took the safe way out rather than risking their own lives to defend others at least disgust is not apathy br br but in the end the ron moore mini series was just activity without purpose a movie on a treadmill forever running yet going nowhere and i just wanted it to be over and by the time it was over my life force had been sucked from me against my own will i was turning into a mindless soulless zombie probably of the type to which this mini series would appeal i needed to replenish myself i needed to and i swear this is true i needed to watch an episode of babylon 5 two episodes in fact and i felt much better and happier
pushing daisies truly is a landmark in television as an art form everything seems to pay homage to amelie and tim burton but so what in a world where fresh ideas are distinctly rare this show will guarantee that you do not care about whether its fresh or not it is just brilliant br br i have been captivated from the start the intelligent writing the directing to the backdrops and dialogue make this show the most incredible masterpiece since the shield and the wire ok not exactly good comparisons but the beauty of pushing daisies is that it has no comparisons on television br br truly addictive and an absolute pleasure perhaps like one of the piemakers pies that get mentioned in such tantalising ways
there is so much that is wrong with this film but to sum it up terrible acting so bad it must have been on purpose poor script they may have had some good ideas but this was not the best way to present the story ridiculously bad ending in some cases the ending manages to save the film not in this case if you manage to sit through the entire film you will want to kick yourself at the end because the ending is not even worth waiting for this is the worst film i have seen in a long time it was complete torture sitting through this film i would have appreciated someone warning me in advance so do yourself a favor watch this film only if you have absolutely nothing better to do even then you will regret having put yourself through the unspeakable torture
all of david prior's movies are terrible on all counts bad writing bad acting bad cinematography no budget the director's brother is usually cast as the male lead but they all have incredible entertainment value because of their unintentional hilarity the plot of almost every david prior film as i like to refer to them is basically the same manly all american commandos team up to blow up communist baddies but unlike other cold war era garbage such as red dawn prior's movies are actually funny because of their over the top premises and acting the best part of jungle assault is the scene in which becker or was is the other dude is being summoned by general mitchell for a top secret mission in south america the funniest line in the movie is then delivered something to the effect of this is my roommate i trained him well what you trained your roommate and apparently this is going to be their solution to avoiding eviction br br if you can find these gems on video used anywhere buy them they are all funny and even funnier after a few beers watch them with a group of your friends for a true mst3k style experience so far my friends and i have managed to get a hold of night wars and aerobicide aka killer workout but the one i recommend the most over them all is final sanction with the freakish looking robert z'dar
for romance's sake as a married man the following two films are recommended br br 1 brief encounter by david lean 1945 uk br br well when a woman goes to a railway station something may happen and it happened how she longed to be there in a little tavern waiting for the man of her dreams but she was married the man was a stranger to the fantasizing woman br br 2 xiao cheng zhi chun by fei mu 1948 china br br well when a woman goes to the market to buy fish grocery and medicine passing through the ruins of an ancient wall in a small town there is much to think about about the melancholy of her life her sick husband in self pity and lack of future just when a jubilant young doctor arrived something happened the doctor was a high school honey of the fantasizing woman br br in both movies from great directors of uk and china the passion vs restraint was so intense yet in the end the intimate feelings had not developed into any physical contacts that leaves you with a great after taste sniffing it intensely without biting it
what made me track this movie down was the viewing vampyres i thought i have to get the other movies this guy larroz has made i was sorry i tracked this down it is a weak attempt at an occult satanic type movie laden with sex and only sex with ugly actors and actresses this is an excuse for sleaze the only redeeming factor was the setting and atmosphere avoid this one too much hype surrounds it not worth the effort of finding it this refers to the welcome to the grind house edition i hope he has some other movies which lives up to vampyres oh and the goat scene was very boring i understand that this is what carries the hype
i have to say i am really surprised at the high ratings for this movie i found it to be absolutely idiotic the mother gets visions when she touches certain things or people and one thing she touched twice made her vision continue just seemed so ridiculous deedee pfieffer's performance was awful i thought she was very irritating the girl who played lori did a good job and so did most of the supporting cast for what they had to work with br br i usually love lmn and am very open minded when it comes to movies but this movie seemed to have a ridiculous plot and over the top acting and it just was not for me
this movie was bad to say the least the plethora of superb cars are disgraced to have have been showcased in this lame movie it starts off with a race from l a to las vegas to be completed in 1hr 45min in a ferrari f430 i did that in 1hr 50min in a tiny 4cylinder 140hp 1993 honda accord seriously this movie does not do justice to these cars obviously these writers are just that and probably drive under the speed limit with their hands 10 2 o'clock i remember seeing on the news how eddie griffin crashed a 1 5 million dollar ferrari enzo going 30 40mph youtube com watch v cnvrmzx2kms br br and the director andy cheng is the biggest sellout he brings shame to his own race i wonder just how many people he orally pleased just to break into hollywood he partook in a movie that portrays asian americans in such a negative and false way asian women cheap money grubbing whores asian men losing compulsive gamblers thugs that get beat all the time what the heck is all the fear about asians why the need to always portray them in such a negative connotation i am so sick of the way hollywood always portrays asians in such a negative and false pretext
at first i was convinced that this was a made for tv movie that wasn't worthy of primetime but after a few minutes of dumb struck awe i realized that there was at least comic value in the over the top stunts and c movie acting this movie would have gotten a 1 if my wife and i hadn't laughed so hard as we watched it in wonder that the actors could keep a straight face it was like a less funny spy version of the big hit i laughed so much i actually bought the big hit dvd with even worse acting we were disappointed that nick chose to marry elena and not jim after all of the hugging and high fives a few rum and cokes will definitely help it go down easier
i usually steer clear of tv movies because of the many ways you know that it's tv movies five seconds into the picture this one got my attention because of the unusual title and its gloomy well crafted mood that is established from the very start while the ever present rain confirmed my suspicions of a misplaced story even if claiming to be set in california the movie was largely shot around a stormy vancouver b c the dark and oppressive outdoors beautifully complement olmos' excellent acting
the fourth tremors feature goes back in time to the year 1889 the legend begins in the small city of perfection which was then rejection nevada as the story begins seventeen miners are killed by the ghastly graboids some of the characters in the present day tremors films have ancestors both figurative and literal in the past most obvious is the ever returning michael gross as hiram gummer unlike his descendant mr gross is inept with firearms so he hires gunslinger billy drago as black hand kelly to shoot 'em up some dirt dragons br br this one takes some getting used to as it takes place in the distant past it's like a western with miniature versions of the original film's monster graboids these tamer dirt dragons are nowhere near as terrorizing as their tremors 1990 counterparts consequently in this film the characters spend an awful lot of time on the ground which would not have happened in the original movie and it was weird to have the citizens give up the fight so quickly when gross temporarily decides to leave town why so helpless why didn't brent roam as juan pedilla immediately rally the people to fight without gross disappointing br br tremors 4 the legend begins 2004 s s wilson michael gross brent roam billy drago
could this be by the same director as don't look now or bad timing poorly br br acted clunkily edited you only have to compare the various accident scenes in this with similar ones in don't look now to see how much roeg has lost his br br touch br br even the generally reliable teresa russell looking a bit chunky these days i'm afraid to report cannot save this one the plot is pure pseudo religious hokum the acting is wooden and roeg's attempts at his trademark dislocation of time are pitiful br br avoid this one like the plague
small college town coed od's why do we care acting sheriff investigates the incident why do we care the interviews show us the comatose subject kirshner as different as the opinions of the subjects being interviewed why do we care result a mess of flashbacks in this mess of a movie featuring a handful of one hit wonders and b flick divas which begs the question why do we care
some here have commented that this is the worst elvis movie ever made well they are only partly right for me this is the worst movie ever made period i have never seen anything so basely crude and insulting and vile and against human nature as this film a true embarrassment to the motion picture industry this isn't even so bad its good there is no campy trashy fun to be had here like in some of elvis' other bad movies like clambake this one is so rotten to sit through its painful pure garbage native americans should sue for their poor clichéd and stereotypical treatment here actually perhaps all human beings should sue for the crime and disservice this movie does to the species as a whole 0 stars seriously grade f
documentary starts in 1986 in nyc where black and hispanic drag queens hold balls that's where they dress up however they like strut their stuff in front of an audience and are voted on we get to know many of the members and see how they all hold together and support each other as one man says to another you have three strikes against you you're black gay and a drag queen these are people who sadly are not accepted in society only at the balls there they can be whoever and whatever they want and be accepted then the film cuts to three years later 1989 and you see how things have changed tragically for some br br sounds depressing but it's not most of the people interviewed are actually very funny and get a lot of humor out of their situations they're well aware of their position in society and accept it with humor just as they should we find out they all live in houses run by various mothers and all help each other out the sense of community in this film is fascinating br br when this film came out in 1990 it was controversial and a big hit it won best documentary awards at numerous festivals but was never even nominated for an academy award their reason was black and hispanic drag queens are not academy material fascinating isn't it homophobia and racism all together br br seen today it's still a great film and a period piece it just isn't like that anymore the ny they show no longer exists the balls are still held but not in the spirit we see here also drag has become more accepted in society for better or worse and i've heard the houses are gone too that's kind of sad i would like to know where these characters are now i know two died of aids but i have no idea about the others and what did happen to that 13 year old and 15 year old shown br br still it a one of a kind documentary fascinating funny and riveting a must see all the way a definite 10 where's the dvd
this movie was highly entertaining the soundtrack bian adams is simply beautiful and inspiring even more impressive is brian adams doing all the songs in french as well the score is also uplifting and dramatic br br the movie is made from a mix of traditional animation combined with computer generated images the result is truly stunning i watch this film at least once a week with my kids and we never tire of it the story is compelling and well narrated br br i don't understand anyone who would rank this movie less than a 7 definately a keeper in my household
this version is likely available at your local dollar store on dvd the print is not great nor is the sound but if you have 1 00 and 90 or so minutes to spare you'll get your money's worth which is not saying an awful lot anna neagle is extremely vapid as nanette whatever her charms may have been back in the day they are not evident in this film a great number of fine character actors appear in this film helen broderick zasu pitts even arden but the material falls remarkably short of their talents still it is interesting to see how such accomplished performers make the most of the weak writing the musical numbers there are really only two are quite horrible clearly the studio did not feel compelled to cash in on the rich musicality of the original no no nanette for what it's worth the dvd can be had for 1 00 it's worth that much just to say you've seen it
i'm only rating this film as a 3 out of pity because it attempts to be worthwhile i love to praise a great movie and i'm not biased toward male movies legally blonde was an excellent film georgia rule on the other hand was a disorganized weak poorly written unrealistic example of movie making at its worst by the end of the film i didn't care who was lying or if anything was resolved br br the most important thing in a film is a good story this story is weak and never develops just because the subject matter is deep doesn't mean the story is good a good story has dynamic characters a dynamic character is one that experiences a major character change and is primed for that change over the course of the movie in georgia rule the character changes were abrupt and undeveloped secondly there were too many attempted dynamic characters pulling off a really good dynamic character is a tough job and takes time you've only got a couple hours in a movie that means that too many attempted dynamic characters will get too little attention to their personal change even if i ignore the poorly written story and the litter of weak dynamic characters i can't even say i liked anyone every character was a mess that's fine if your're writing american beauty but not when you're attempting a dramatic comedy georgia was a horrible mother her daughter was a horrible mother and daughter and lohan was a horrible excuse for a human being no i'm not cutting her any slack because she was molested crap happens to everyone and we're all responsible for our own actions the dudley do right mormon kid should have had the guts not to compromise his religion and commitments and simon i mean seriously what kind of guy lets a 17 year old girl who's been molested just stay over occasionally unless he's an actor or a politician this movie is worth watching if you want to remind yourself what good movie making is not
the director outfitted in chains and leather warned the audience at the sf frameline film festival friday night that we were about to see an experiental film experimental leave the video camera on the back seat of the car let the tape roll and edit in all the pointless dreck within eyesight a meandering pastiche road show manqué that starts nowhere and takes the audience no place the gratuitous violence that opens the movie drove more than one patron from the castro theater i would have left too but my cine buddy needed a ride home and has this thing about seeing even the worse merde through to the end by the time the lights came up the audience had thinned considerably tepid applause pro forma questions of the director who seemed pleased with the product avoid this film
from the pen of richard condon the manchurian candidate 1962 comes this muddled tale of political intrigue and assassination the story told in almost comic book fashion is difficult to swallow all star cast considered this poor effort is not entirely the fault of the cast and crew the novel was replete with the same short comings it seems as though at times the story is actually mocking the more sincere effort put forth in manchurian candidate a disappointment on all counts
really an amazing pile of pap br br a predictable slow moving soul destroying mind numbing movie to which slitting your own wrists with a rusty bread knife seems well almost necessary br br the acting is over done for the thin dialogue every scene is at least twice as long as it needs to be the intricate details of how this career is collapsing or that career is rising is just far too dreary and mundane for words the music would be good if you didn't have to sit through the movie but really three good songs is not enough reward for the effort required to watch the movie br br watching this film i prayed to god for narcolepsy or for someone to shoot me br br never ever ever again
i love this movie as a kid this was one of the first movies i saw that made me flinch sure it is mild now but back in the day it was awesome dentists are one thing so many people fear so why not do a movie about a killer dentist it's cheesy it's fun sometimes it's scary but it is awesome and i have always had a love for medical horror and corbin bernsen plays dr feinstone perfectly no one could have done it better and for a low budget horror film the effects and such are quite good and i also love the theme music it goes well with the film ken foree dawn of the dead is also in this one playing a nosy cop and does a fine job there is a fair amount of blood and some really cool torture death scenes check this one out
acting this film is a very well acted film i will say that the performances are slightly weak at times but for the most part the acting is very good the only actor that blew me away with his performance was jude law as harlen maguire he was incredible tom hanks seemed alittle unsure at at a few points throughout the film but he too was incredible paul newman good as always cinematography this is what made the movie a masterpiece and i rarely use that word conrad hall is a true genius if at any point in the movie you were to pause it you will see the delicately crafted work of this man he sets up every shot so that nothing is left out when the camera is still there is a postcard like quality to the screen when the camera is moving every shot is planned to understated perfection but it doesn't stop there conrads choice of colors and contrast between light and dark settings is a work of art the way he lights the set is some of the most amazing lighting work i've seen his work on this movie made it what it is this movie is at the top of the list for best cinematography with lotr black hawk down hero cthd moulin rouge and vertigo story people will say this movie is a 1930s gangster flick but i believe they missed the point of the movie it is a love story about a hit man who fails in trying to protect his son from the life he chose it is a brilliantly crafted story that unfolds into a beautiful bond between two people who have nothing but each other the screen writing is worthy of an oscar music thomas newman conducts a sad but hopeful score to intensify this sad but hopeful story the music is some of the most beautiful and moving scores i've herd direction sam mendes is a new director with a feel of an experienced director the symbols he uses and the performances he gets from his actors is a rarity in todays film making world i will be on the lookout for the next sam mendes film 10 10 one of the most moving and beautiful movies i've ever seen
what if somerset maugham had written a novel about a coal miner who decided to search for transcendental enlightenment by trying to join a country club if he had he could have called it the razor's edge since the katha upanishad tells us the sharp edge of a razor is difficult to pass over thus the wise say the path to salvation is hard but maugham decided to stick with the well bred class and so we have darryl f zanuck's version of larry darrell recently returned from wwi carefully groomed well connected in society and determined to find himself by becoming a coal miner br br or as maugham tells us this is the young man of whom i write he is not famous it may be that when at last his life comes to an end he will leave no more trace of his sojourn on this earth than a stone thrown into a river leaves on the surface of the water yet it may be that the way of life he has chosen for himself may have an ever growing influence over his fellow men so that long after his death perhaps it will be realized that lived in this age a very remarkable creature br br the razor's edge has all of zanuck's cultural taste that money could buy it's so earnest so sincere so self important as larry goes about his search for wisdom working in mines on merchant ships climbing a himalayan mountain to learn from an ancient wise man we have his selfish girl friend isabel played by gene tierney his tragic childhood chum played by anne baxter the girlfriend's snobbish and impeccably clad uncle played by clifton webb and willie maugham himself played by herbert marshall taking notes the movie is so insufferably smug about goodness that the only thing that perks it up a bit is clifton webb as elliot templeton if i live to be a hundred i shall never understand how any young man can come to paris without evening clothes webb has some good lines but we wind up appreciating clifton webb not elliot templeton br br zanuck wanted a prestige hit for twentieth century when he bought the rights to maugham's novel he waited a year until tyrone power was released from military service he made sure there were well dressed extras by the dozens a score that sounds as if it were meant for a cathedral and he even wrote some of the scenes himself the effort is as self conscious as a fat man wearing a rented tux despite hollywood's view of things in the razor's edge i can tell you that for most people hard work doesn't bring enlightenment just weariness and low pay br br after nearly two and a half hours we last see larry carrying his duffle bag on board a tramp steamer in a gale he's going to work his way back to america from europe with a contented smile on his face my dear somerset maugham says to isabel at the same time in an elaborately decorated parlor larry has found what we all want and what very few of us ever get i don't think anyone can fail to be better and nobler kinder for knowing him you see my dear goodness is after all the greatest force in the world and he's got it larry and the audience both need a healthy dose of dramamine br br maugham lest we forget was a fine writer of plays novels essays and short stories to see how the movies could do him justice watch the way some of his short stories were brought to the screen in encore trio and quartet and instead of wasting time with larry darrell spend some time with lawrence durrell the alexandria quartet is a good read
great voices lots of adventure and clever dialogue make this a very good movie the addition of character to the three lead animals gives the story a lot more depth and meaning particularly the relationship between the older fellow shadow and the young hellraiser chance the earlier versions of this film were unable to give the animals any real personality or motive which is done perfectly here sally field is lovable in anything but really shines in this film as the proud feline sassy great contrast between cat and dog perspectives on life and just the right amount of spirit and warm fuzzies to make the plot and resolution excellent there's even an uplifting score and beautiful mountain scenery definitely perfect for an evening alone or with the kids hats off to disney
again it seems totally illogical to me at least that arthur merits a mere 6 4 out of 10 possible steve gordon's one shot masterpiece herein is the totally unlikely if not quite impossible melding of wildly disparate elements that he managed to make alcoholism laugh friendly rather than tearjerking tragic is in itself wonderful that he gave dudley moore his finest role and every other cinematic element herein its optimal impact including the score seems to me patent and egregious i challenge anyone to sit through this film and not laugh out loud but apparently nearly a third of its audience has so managed well i for one found and find gordon's effort both laughable and lovable and the iikes of geraldine fitzgerald's great aunt and stephen elliott's murderous would be father in law absolute gems of background characters even the black chauffeur managed to escape patronization and the late sniffish sir john gielgud was right about accepting his fee but wrong about undertaking his role arthur makes no effort to underztand much less rationalize the scourge of alcoholism hey ifit ain't booze it's other drugs of choice including meth and addictions are merely symptoms not targets it simply observes in its own quizzical manner
nice attempt and good ideas redemption of the prostitute human beings helping each other out but a poor result the director obviously tried to emulate his french colleague tran anh hung by recreating an ambiance which is suppose to portray viet nam the only problem is that this viet nam is long gone and when the scent of the green papaya had a historical background trying to project this kind of ambiance muffled sounds and the slow pace of life on modern days leaves a feeling of fake besides it rapidly creates a sentiment of boredom and the outcome becomes too obvious br br i can only suppose the action takes place in saigon or da nang because that is where harvey keitel ex marine in the movie was probably stationed during the war but in southern viet nam nobody or very few people speak with the clip northern accent displayed by the actors seriously odd even for a bad vietnamese speaker br br an old poet with leprosy very doubtful not a disease for people of his condition a peasant girl who can read and write elaborate vietnamese poetry even more doubtful br br
master director ching siu tung's perhaps most popular achievement is this series a chinese ghost story 1 3 chinese ghost story stars leslie cheung in some distant past in china as a tax collector who is forced to spend a night during his collecting trip in a mysterious castle in which some strange old warriors fight and meet him beautiful actress joey wang wong is the ghost who lives in that castle and is under a domination of one powerful demon a wood devil who collects human souls for herself itself with the help of her beautiful ghosts leslie and joey fall in love and even though ghosts are not allowed to live with humans they decide to break that rule and live happily together for the rest of their lives this is not what the wood devil thinks and our protagonists have to fight for their lives and their happiness br br this film is no less full of magic than other films by ching siu tung his masterpieces include duel to the death 1983 and the swordsman series which all have incredible visuals and kinetic power in their action scenes ghost story is full of brilliant lightning and dark atmosphere which is lightened by the strong presence of the beautiful and good willing ghost the effects are simply breath taking and would work at their greatest power in the big screen the camera is moving and twisted all the time and it adds to the fairy tale atmosphere this film has there's plenty of wire'fu stunts too and even though some think they are and look gratuitous or stupid when used in films i cannot agree and think they give motion pictures the kind of magic freedom and creativeness any other tool could not give when people fly in these films it means the films are not just about our world and they usually depict things larger than life with the power of this larger than life art form br br the story about the power of love is pretty touching and warm but the problem is again that the characters are little too shallow and act unexplainably occasionally leslie and joey should have been written with greater care and their characters should be even more warm deep and genuine in order to give the story a greater power and thus make the film even more noteworthy and important achievement also the message about love and power of it is underlined little too much at one point and it should have been left just to the viewer's mind to be interpreted and found another negative point about the dialogue is that it's too plenty and people talk in this film without a reason that is very irritating and sadly shows the flaws many scriptwriters tend to do when they write their movies people just talk and talk and it's all there just to make everything as easy to understand as possible and so the film is not too challenging or believable as it has this gratuitous element just think about the films of the japanese film maker takeshi kitano his films have very little dialogue and all there is is all the necessary as he tells his things by other tools of cinema and never talks or makes other characters talk too much in his movies this is just the talent the writers should have in order to write greater scripts br br otherwise chinese ghost story is very beautiful and visually breath taking piece of eastern cinema and also the song that is played in the film is very beautiful and hopefully earned some award in the hong kong film awards back then i give chinese ghost story 7 10 and without the flaws mentioned above this would without a doubt be almost perfect masterpiece of the fantasy genre
awful simply awful it proves my theory about star power this is supposed to be great tv because the guy who directed battlestar titanica is the same guy who directed this shlop schtock schtick about a chick b o r i n g br br find something a thousand times more interesting to do like watch your tv with no picture and no sound 1 10 i rated it so high b c there aren't any negative scores in the imdb com rating system br br zaphoid br br ps my theory about star power is the more star power used in a show the weaker the show is it's called an indirect proportionality quality 1 star power less sp makes for better quality etc another way to look at it is more is less br br z
the full title of this film is 'may you be in heaven a half hour before the devil knows you're dead' a rewording of the old irish toast 'may you have food and raiment a soft pillow for your head may you be 40 years in heaven before the devil knows you're dead ' first time screenwriter kelly masterson with some modifications by director sidney lumet has concocted a melodrama that explores just how fragmented a family can become when external forces drive the members to unthinkable extremes in this film the viewer is allowed to witness the gradual but nearly complete implosion of a family by a much used but here very sensible manipulation of the flashback flash forward technique of storytelling by repeatedly offering the differing vantages of each of the characters about the central incidents that drive this rather harrowing tale we see all the motivations of the players in this case of a robbery gone very wrong br br andy hanson philip seymour hoffman is a wealthy executive married to an emotionally needy gina marisa tomei and addicted to an expensive drug habit his life is beginning to crumble and he needs money andy's ne're do well younger brother hank ethan hawke is a life in ruins he is divorced from his shrewish wife martha amy ryan is behind in alimony and child support and has borrowed all he can from his friends and he needs money andy proposes a low key robbery of a small mall mom and pop jewelry store that promises safe quick cash for both the glitch is that the jewelry story belongs to the men's parents charles albert finney and nanette rosemary harris andy advances hank some cash and wrangles an agreement that hank will do the actual robbery but though hank agrees to the 'fail safe' plan he hires a friend to take on the actual job while hank plans to be the driver of the getaway car the robbery is horribly botched when nanette filing in for the regular clerk shoots the robber and is herself shot in the mess the disaster unveils many secrets about the fragile relationships of the family and when nanette dies charles and andy and hank and their respective partners are driven to disastrous ends with surprises at every turn br br each of the actors in this strong but emotionally acrid film gives superb performances and while we have come to expect that from hoffman hawke tomei finney ryan and harris it is the wise hand of direction from sidney lumet that make this film so unforgettably powerful it is not an easy film to watch but it is a film that allows some bravura performances that demand our respect a film that reminds us how fragile many families can be grady harp
i've written at least a half dozen scathing reviews of this abysmal little flick and none get published so i must opine that someone at imdb com really likes this awful movie the idea that a bunch of oilmen can resurrect a military tank that has set in the desert for over a decade and make a fighting machine of it again is ludicrous so is the acting and direction pass on it
citizenx 1995 is the developing world's answer to silence of the lambs where silence' terrorized our peace of mind citizen' exhausts and saddens us instead this dramatization of the chikatilo case translates rather well thanks to a westernized friendship between two rostov cops who become equals br br citizenx may also argue against the death penalty far better than kevin spacey's the life of david gayle 2002 br br humans are machiavellian mammals under which lie limbic brains lizard logic why did two kids who knew better stone to death a toddler they kidnapped why do bloodthirsty women yell li lilililililii' at acts of obscene terrorism my own term for this is limbic domination' the lizard logic urge to dominate an enemy' if you have the words enemy' vengeance' in your vocabulary you're easily capable of limbic domination' br br in wwii devastated 1980s rostov located at the mouth of the don river near the black sea nothing suppressed andrei chikatilo's urge for limbic domination' from overpowering his layers of civilization chikatilo jeffrey demunn 's easy victims were paupers usually children who rode the interurban train for fun since they couldn't afford anything else br br citizenx reminds us that the denials of a rampant soviet bureaucracy cost the lives of 52 such lambs' rostov's serial killer roamed free for almost 7 years after the police arrested and let him go br br the politicization of crimefighting is harmful to police forces everywhere although policing routinely suffers from corruption all over the world in the west vote grabbing by politicians can set up chronic inter agency rivalries stymieing a more coordinated response to crime in the soviet union of citizenx however viktor burakov stephen rea 's killer department was suffering from a repressive bureaucracy br br geoffrey demunn plays the psychosexually inadequate chikatilo with faultless but understated authority to the point of complete obscurity in real life too chikatilo had a lifetime's experience blending in and evading capture br br his pursuer on the other hand sticks out as a strange bird given to unheralded naive outbursts perhaps by design stephen rea gives a very strange performance as forensics chief burakov rea's russian accent is impenetrable and his burakov is humourless and sullen at odds with everyone br br so it's donald sutherland who walks away with the picture sutherland's col fetisov burakov's boss and at first his only supporter is an overly restrained patient militiaman whose dignified carriage bears testimony to decades of bureaucratic machinations his reawakening as a logic driven yet still passionate cop becomes the film's cornerstone idealism br br joss ackland does another turn as a vicious apparatchik secretary of communist ideology bondarchuk overseeing the investigation naturally he quashed the arrest of the most likely suspect a communist in 1984 a man carrying rope and a knife in his bag supposedly going home andrei chikatilo br br soon he replaced burakov with another moscow apparatchik detective gorbunov john wood insisting that the investigation now focus on known homosexuals' the funniest scene of this sad sad film comes during bondarchuk's gorbunov's institutionalized harassment one stupid cop earnestly reports as i suspected comrade it's fornication i've made some drawings' cue howling laughter br br 5yrs after the bodies began piling up in 1987 the police finally tried soliciting criminal profiles the only cooperating soviet psychiatrist was dr aleksandr bukhanovsky max von sydow who termed the unsub citizenx' he later also observed to fetisov burakov that together you make a wonderful person' we concur br br the drawn out pace spread over a decade perfectly captures the institutional inertia of glasnost openness' that wasn't the contrast with perestroika restructuring' couldn't've been greater for the case although chikatilo was still prowling railway stations police plans were about to bear fruit br br in 1990 col fetisov was expeditiously promoted to general his nemesis bondarchuk disappeared off the scene allowing the investigation to finally proceed without political interference staff communications publicity suddenly all were available in just one night of telephoning around fetisov got his depressed forensics chief access to the fbi's serial murder task force at quantico where fetisov discovered staff are regularly rotated off serial murder cases to stave off just such psychological damage to investigators br br fetisov advises his newly promoted forensics chief now colonel' burakov of all these changes in an avalanche of confession that becomes the movie's powerhouse watershed scene fetisov's is the most tender apology i've ever seen on film privately i offer my deepest apologies to you and your wife i hope that someday you can forgive me my ignorance' he almost whispers br br a hbo production citizenx is a film of the highest caliber not only do the exteriors look authentically bleak shot exclusively in the most run down parts of otherwise spectacular budapest but randy edelman's soaring soundtrack is entirely overwhelming and frequently our only respite from the bleak brutality those who speak hungarian will recognize the many hungarian accents and credits br br chikatilo's actual murders are depicted as bleak aberrant behaviour born of character flaws and ignorance in an equally bleak world this makes the murders seem not entirely out of place but of course they were as president kennedy reminded us we all cherish the futures of our children' br br citizenx communicates perfectly that killing is far more grisly and obscene than any vengeance fantasy might imply serial rapists rape to dominate serial killers kill to dominate so do some soldiers such limbic dominators' make poor humans br br warning spoiler the real andrei chikatilo was the world's most prolific known serial killer convicted he was executed in 1992 in the manner of all soviet union death sentences one shot in the back of the head foolishly such methods destroy any possibility of studying a deviant brain after death br br conclusion the best outcome is always the prevention of killings not their prosecution executions merely guarantee society's failure to learn from the complex reality of victims' deaths when we dispatch even anecdotal evidence of how why they died nor do killers learn regret if they're dead br br vengeance doesn't unkill victims baying for the killer's blood constitutes nothing better than counter domination once it's too late br br vengeance on behalf of the grieving isn't justice for the deceased it's appeasement of the living 10 10
streetfight aka coonskin is a very unique film directed by animation pioneer ralph bakshi it is an oddity of the cinema and is very much worth seeing it is live action mixed with animation seemingly influenced on disney's legendary song of the south almost as if it is a response to that flick philip michael thomas later to become don johnson's sidekick on miami vice and scatman crothers most famous for his role in kubrick's the shining are prison escapees charles gordone and barry white yes that barry white are thomas' friends and plan to help him escape prison they are stuck at a police roadblock and crothers tells thomas a story about a black rabbit a bear and a fox who move from the south to harlem in order to find a more peaceful existence the story is animated and provides a lot of wonderous things to see like all of bakshi's films most will be annoyed and will dislike the animation true animation lovers will forgive its clunkiness and fall in love with its inventiveness the movie is very violent very sexual and it is mostly about battles between the races for a long time i thought i was watching something extremely important but after a while especially after i got done watching it it started to seem more like a run of the mill blacksploitation flick along the lines of superfly it's very sloppy and doesn't really say anything besides isn't bakshi white whatever the answer to that coonskin streetfight is still very much worth watching for animation aficionados as well as cult movie fans 7 10
the lion king series is easily the crowning achievement in disney animation the original lion king is the greatest masterpiece in cel animation lion king ii simba's pride is the by far the best direct to video sequel that disney or any other studio has made for an animated feature it deserved a theatrical release the same can be said for this movie it has the original cast songs by elton john a hilarious story exciting action and touching character moments everything you've come to expect from this series not so much a new story but filler and extended background on timon and pumbaa and their place in this story what impressed me the most was the care taken in the animation all to often disney shorts on the animation quality of their video and television efforts but here they seamlessly blend new animation with footage from the original film the scenes never seem out of place nathan lane and ernie sabella are in full swing as timon and pumbaa matthew broderick robert guillame and moira kelly reprise their roles as simba rafiki and nala respectively we even get a return visit by whoopi goldberg and cheech marin as the hyenas there are many big laughs in this movie so if you love lion king you need this movie the story is just not complete without it
i'm not a huge star trek fan but i was looking forward to this i was intrigued by the pre hype descriptions of the enterprise its cramped submarine styling and rough edged technology compared to the treks we are used to br br i didn't see anything all that interesting in this pilot i found the plot to be convoluted and confusing br br i will admit that i did like some of the character development the depictions of the humans as an 'adolescent' species ready to outgrow their britches was entertaining br br and that vulcan babe had one hell of an incredible rack br br but i don't think i'm going to get hooked on this series br br 3 10
i saw this australian film about 10 years ago and have never forgotten it the movie shows the horror of war in a way that hollywood usually glosses over the relationship between the soldiers of the two warring countries is highlighted by the differences in culture and the ultimate knowledge that in the end we are all really not different on the inside if you can find any type of copy of this buy or rent it you won't be disappointed just awed
actress patty duke wrote an insightful funny rough hewn book about her career as an actress her crazy quilt love life and her manic depressive episodes and suicide attempts which almost put her away for good with this rich material to draw from and patty playing herself in the final act one would think a crack tv director like gilbert cates could bring it all together on film but call me anna is a pale shadow of duke's autobiography for those who haven't read the book the sketchy narrative leaping forward in time isn't absorbing we are never allowed to get our bearings with what's happening and the production seems stunted by a low budget the actors are miscast and the value of having duke herself finally appear does not pay off the film's phony reality is so thick at this point that patty can't bring stability to the scenario it appears as if the producers were sincere enough and consciousness minded to anxiously steer the film towards duke's ultimate diagnosis and mental freedom but they left out many dramatic opportunities in the process
there aren't too many times when i see a film and go huh what but this was one of them maybe after seeing zabriskie point i felt much the same way woody allen felt after seeing 2001 he only liked the film after seeing it three times over a two year period realizing the filmmaker was ahead of him in what was going on michelangelo antonioni in one of his few tries at making films inside of the us after red desert he did blow up this film china and the passenger all filmed outside his native italy i could sense he almost tried to learn about the ways of the country through his own mastery of the medium the results show that he doesn't lack the means to present images feelings tones colors sounds and a visual representation of this era a director's job is to see antonioni once stated whatever that means he doesn't disappoint for the admirer of his post fifties work i say post fifties since i've yet to see any of his films from before l'avventura br br what he does lack is a point at least the kind of point that he could bring in blow up and the eclipse you get the feeling of what is around these characters what the themes are bringing forth to their consciousness however in this case the characters and the actors don't bring much conviction or purpose antonioni coming from the school of hard knocks neo realistic film making does do what he can with his mostly non professional cast those who look most like real actors are subjugated to the roles of the corporate characters but the two stars mark frechette and daria halprin seem as if antonioni's under directing them perhaps that was the point the story's split into three acts thankfully not too confusing as mark escapes his existence around the boiling dangerous campus life going on in the circa late 60's la area and daria is sent out from la to drive to phoenix for some business meeting they meet by chance as mark's plane how does he know how to drive maybe a little background info there and daria's car meet up and they spend some time together in an existential kind of groove out in the desert aside from a stylistically mesmerizing if bizarre sex scene much of this act isn't terribly interesting br br the two leads are fair enough to look at but what exactly draws them to each other outside of curiosity the ideas that come forth in part from a screenplay co written by sam shepard aren't too revealing except for one brief instant where drugs vs reality is brought up then the film heads towards the third act as mark decides to do the right thing under disastrous circumstances and daria arrives at her boss' place only to be in full disillusionment not taking into account the infamous last five minutes or so of the film although the film took its time telling its story i didn't have as much of a problem with that as i did that the story only engages a certain kind of viewer i understand and empathize with the feelings and doubts and fears as well as the self confidence of the anti establishment but maybe antonioni isn't entirely fully aware of it himself in some scenes he as director and editor and the often astounding cinematography by alfio contini find the scenery and backgrounds more enlightening and fixating than the people in the foreground not to say the technical side of zabriskie point isn't involving to a degree this may make some feel drowsy as antonioni is probably far greater as a documentary filmmaker as he is a theatrical director like say francis ford coppola is br br the deserts skies city and even the faces in close ups are filmed with the eye of a filmmaker in love with the art of getting things in the frame bringing us in the soundtrack is equally compelling with a master stroke including a sweet rolling stones song at one point and then a crushing surreal pink floyd song re titled from 'careful with that axe eugene one of their best pre dark side in the explosion sequence if only the performances weren't so one sided i might find this to be on par with blow up or the eclipse it's an unconventional stroke of genius on one hand and on the other a boring take on what was the hippie radical movement of the late 60's but hey what may be boring for an american such as myself born in the eighties may not be to others outside the us such as say italy and it does ask to not be discarded right away after one viewing
this comedy is really not funny it' a romance that plays so much on stereotypes it makes no impact it's a caper film so derivative yes even back then it has no snap br br the cast is adequate more than that it's hard to say however what's nice is that the players are unfamiliar at mgm this would have starred robert montgomery the wife of a businessman with no time for anything but work could have been any number of actresses br br we can be grateful that this little known film is peopled by performers mostly unknown today and the production values aren't awful yet it makes no real impression br br it's a generic knockoff and who wants that
ringmaster jerry springer's pathetic excuse for wasting film that should be recycled as toilet paper recently destroyed my confidence in the art of film first of all it was made second of all people went to see it third some people voted it the best movie they have ever seen if a monkey could make a movie i'm 100 percent sure that it would be 1 billion times as good most crappy movies have their moments even godzilla had a few cool special effects this film's moment was when i left the theater nauseated the only thing that possibly could've made this movie any worse would be if jerry springer was the star if i want to stare at crap for an hour and a half i'll take a dump in a can if anyone didn't utterly despise this movie i pity you and your children and your children's children's children however contrary to springer's beliefs i clearly don't condone children having sex
at least it's not full of sensless violence or fluff it's also not very full of thought or a smooth storyline this story had some potential but the director appears to have lost site of the green the story is disjointed and goes off in strange br br directions to no conclusion i also don't believe the director spent much time around a golf country club either some of the depictions are absurd not very engaging
this work is less about steve martin's character davis than it is about kline mack and glover simon and kline and mcdonnell claire but the dialog inserted via davis is pondering contemplative near poetic existentialism at its best he is witty intelligent and thoughtful in both dialog delivery and content the writers deserved an oscar br br the performances are easy relaxed and natural just what you would expect from a list actors martin contributes the performance which leads into his more recent shopgirl guiding you through life love and the pursuit of wisdom if not happiness kline is the straight the suit the conformist of the film and as such his performance is crisp and refreshing br br this work deals with life in all aspects it engenders a true emotional investment in its characters and leaves you feeling hopeful that mankind is not doomed after all no matter what you believe deep down br br all in all this is delightful with a gritty moment or two and easy natural dialog which draws you in assisting its audience in gaining a high enjoyment from this work it's definitely worth your time though it may not be every one's top choice as friday saturday night entertainment br br i really enjoyed the intelligence this exhibited it's not typical and was an unexpected surprise another wonderful surprise was the honesty exhibited herein the couples and friends hold detailed conversations which feel and sound fully honest and again natural i was very impressed with this work and will be adding it to the dvd collection soon br br it rates a 9 1 10 from br br the fiend
i absolutely hate this programme what kind of people sit and watch this garbage ok my dad and mum love it lol but i make sure i'm well out of the room before it comes on its so depressing and dreary but the worst thing about it is the acting i cant stand all detective programmes such as this because the detectives are so wooden and heartless what happened to detective programmes with real mystery i mean who wants to know what happened to fictional characters we know nothing about that died over 20 years ago i wish the bbc would put more comedy on bbc1 cos now with the vicar of dibley finished there is more room for crap like this
i remember this film exhibit in barcelona spain in 1970 for the time of a week although it could seems incredible and i can't offer any explanation for it this movie was exhibit in a theater dedicated to movies of art and big quality that is bergman resnais malle buñuel and the projected man few people saw it luckly people no doubt and no reference about this very boring sf movie can be found in the peter nichols science fiction encyclopidie or about the author of the original novel very indicative i remember of it after all this years a no story a lot of special effects that seems ridiculous effects in fact and no more it seems that in some countries the running time is 90 mm and in anothers 77 min well it means only a little more of pain
sir john gielgud must have become senile to star in a mess of a movie like this one br br this is one of those films i suppose that is considered art but don't be fooled it's garbage stick to the art you can admire in a frame because the films that are labeled as such are usually unintelligible forgeries like this br br in this masterpiece giegud recites shakespeare's the tempest while the camera pans away to nude people one of them a little kid urinating in a swimming pool wow this is heady stuff and real art ain't it that's just one example most of the story makes no sense is impossible to follow and hence is one that liberal critics are afraid to say they didn't understand so they give it high marks to save their phony egos you want shakespeare read his books
sexo cannibal or devil hunter as it's more commonly known amongst english speaking audiences starts with actress model laura crawford ursula buchfellner as ursula fellner checking out locations for her new film along with her assistant jane gisela hahn after a long days work laura is relaxing in the bath of her room when two very dubious character's named chris werner pochath thomas antonio mayans burst in kidnap her having been helped by the treacherous jane laura's agent gets on the blower to rent a hero peter weston al cliver who is informed of the situation the kidnappers have laura on an isolated island are demanding a 6 million ransom peter is told that he will be paid 200 000 to get her back safely a further 10 of the 6 million if he brings that back as well faster than a rat up a drain pipe peter his vietnam vet buddy helicopter pilot jack are on the island deciding on how to save laura so the kidnappers have laura peter has the 6 million but neither want to hand them over that much just to complicate things further this particular isolated island is home to a primitive tribe hell in all the generations they've lived there they've only managed to build one straw hut now that's primitive who worship some cannibal monster dude burt altman with bulging eyes as a god with human sacrifices this cannibal has a liking for young white female flesh intestines br br this spanish french german co production was co written directed by the prolific jesus franco who also gets the credit for the music as well sexo cannibal has gained a certain amount of notoriety here in the uk as it was placed on the 'video nasties' list in the early 80's under it's alternate devil hunter title therefore officially classed as obscene banned having said that i have no idea why as it is one bad film even franco who isn't afraid to be associated with a turkey decides he wants to hide under the pseudonym of clifford brown i'd imagine even the most die hard franco fan would have a hard time defending this thing the script by franco erm sorry i mean clifford brown julian esteban as julius valery who was obviously another one less than impressed with the finished product wanted his named removed is awful it's as simple straight forward as that for a start the film is so boring it's untrue the kidnap plot is one of the dullest i've ever seen without the slightest bit of tension or excitement involved the horror side of things don't improve as we get a big black guy with stupid looking over sized bloodshot eyes plus two tame cannibal scenes as a horror film sexo cannibal fails as an action adventure it has no more success this is one to avoid br br director franco shows his usual incompetence throughout a decapitated head is achieved by an actor lying on the ground with large leaves placed around the bottom of his neck to try give the impression it's not attached to anything the cannibal scenes are poor the action is lame it has endless scenes of people randomly walking around the jungle getting from 'a' to 'b' not really doing anything when they get there either it becomes incredibly dull tedious to watch after about 10 minutes don't forget this thing goes on for 94 minutes in it's uncut state i also must mention the hilarious scene when al cliver is supposed to be climbing a cliff this is achieved by franco turning his camera on it's side having cliver crawl along the floor just look at the way his coat hangs the way he never grabs onto to anything as he just pulls himself along the gore isn't that great as far as euro cannibal films go this is very tame there are some gross close ups of the cannibals mouth as it chews bits of meat a man is impaled on spikes there's some blood a handful of intestines there's a fair bit of nudity in sexo cannibal an unpleasant rape scene br br sexo cannibal must have had a low budget i mean low this is a shoddy poorly made film with awful special effects rock bottom production values the only decent thing about it is the jungle setting which at least looks authentic the music sucks sound effects become annoying as there is lots of heavy breathing whenever the cannibal is on screen the acting sucks the whole thing was obviously dubbed anyway but no one in this thing can act br br sexo cannibal is a terrible film that commits the fatal mistake of being as boring as hell the only good things i can say is that it has a certain sleazy atmosphere to it those close ups of the cannibal chewing meat are pretty gross anyone looking for a decent cinematic experience should give sexo cannibal as wide a berth as possible one to avoid
superb movie very good photography of 1969 70 bolton which seems now to be a different world thoughtful and an excellent dramatisation and production james mason a real first class star it is and i would agree with the above comment that this movie is a national treasure
the movie is actually too slow there are some nice images but it cannot outweigh the fact that the movie is in fact boring you see a sexual intercourse a lot of watermelons and a sexual intercourse while eating a melon and maybe a little bit more it may sound even interesting to someone but believe me to watch it for 2 hours isn't fun at all though you laugh several times but it's really not enough and it may be more out of despair and disbelieve than out of fun to disturb the boredom director tries to put few movie video clips into the movie they are really colorful clips of absurd songs maybe from the 50's but it's hard to say exactly and they are trying to be funny so hard that it's really sad several times you have a feeling that the plot could evolve into something that a powerful scene is being created but at the end it just somehow evaporates and that's it beside the clips there are hardly any dialogs let alone music the director is trying to be original and artistic at all cost personally i cannot recommend the movie i believe that art is something that shouldn't be boring during the projection there was yawning all around the cinema which just corroborates my short review
when marlene dietrich was labeled box office poison in 1938 one of a handful of actresses so named by the trades papers it was films like the garden of allah how a film could be so breathtakingly beautiful to behold and be so insipidly dull is beyond me also how marlene if she was trying to expand her range and not play a sexpot got stuck with such an old fashioned story is beyond me br br the garden of allah one of the very first films in modern technicolor was a novel set at the turn of the last century by robert hitchens who then collaborated on a play adaption with mary anderson that ran for 241 performances in 1911 12 it then got two silent screen adaptions the story is about a monk who runs away from the monastery out in french tunisia to see some of what he's missed in the world he runs into a similarly sheltered woman who was unmarried and spent her prime years caring for a sick parent she's traveling now in the desert and the two meet on a train br br the woman is of course marlene and the runaway monk is charles boyer i'm not sure what was in david o selznick's mind in filming this story someone like ingrid bergman might have made it palatable for the audience but you can bet that the movie going public of 1936 when they plunked their money down for a ticket they expected to see marlene as a modern day salome rather than a saint with that title the public still remembered rudolph valentino and you can bet that it was some desert romance and seduction that they were expecting br br as for the monks you have to remember that they are self supporting in their monasteries and this particular one bottles a special wine of which boyer happens to be the one with the secret the monastery will have to rethink it's economics if boyer leaves the monks are a sincerely pious group but from the head man charles waldron on down they've a right to be a little concerned with some self interest br br anyway a whole lot of religious platitudes get said here by a pair of leads that really are not suited for the parts most especially marlene dietrich i would watch this film with an eye for the special color desert cinematography and forget the plot
with 'twelve monkeys' you need to pay attention but if you do that you probably find a lot to appreciate i know i did the story is interesting and deals with time traveling a virus killed a lot of people back in 1997 and a guy named cole bruce willis is send back to 1990 and 1996 to find a cure for the virus in 1990 he is arrested and put in a mental hospital there he meets jeffrey goines brad pitt who probably has something to do with the virus he also meets psychiatrist dr kathryn railly madeleine stowe who doesn't believe him in 1990 when cole disappears from the mental hospital while he is chained and locked in a room and re appears in 1996 kathryn starts believing cole's stories br br the movie constantly plays with time cole makes a phone call and leaves a message in 1996 it is picked up in the future and they send someone for cole that someone appears only seconds after the phone call things like this happen throughout the movie and therefore you must keep attention you could ask some questions but since you can't have an answer yourself it is better to agree with the movie br br 'twelve monkeys' works as sci fi with some great images and a dark atmosphere and it works as a thriller you are never certain of what will happen next and that helps the movie may be it has some flaws in the story but since it is about a fictional thing like time traveling you should accept what the movie tells us and just try to enjoy that was the easy part for me
wow finally jim carrey has returned from the died this movie had me laughing and crying it also sends a message that we should all know and learn from jeniffer aniston was great she will finally have a hit movie under her belt if you liked liar liar you will love this movie i give it 9 10
with this abc family attempt of the hit blockbuster cheaper by the dozen comes an obnoxious amount of corny dialogue shallow plot lines and cheesy comebacks with about two good actors among many wanna be's this movie was a major disappointment its a hollywood wannabe ditto of an already bad plot then because they needed a lot of actors that meant that they'd probably be more lenient so the acting wasn't five star the plot moved fairly fast and the twists were bad and had horrible timing the junction of characters and the end relationships were also too mushy and clichéd for me spare yourself and rent something better
i can't believe i am just now seeing this film i think perhaps i thought it was another movie about slaves being mistreated and i avoided roots for the same reason just as i have yet to see schindler's list i don't want to be entertained by other peoples' pain not matter how authentic or informative it is supposed to be br br so i guess the main thing i noticed about the color purple was that it was not about black people being mistreated by whites the black people were perfectly capable of raping their own daughters or giving them away to be treated as slaves by their husbands it was painful to watch but everyone redeemed himself in the end and the acting was phenomenal i couldn't believe the character oprah played at the age of 35 and i adore whoopi to start with she was amazing i'm so glad i was feeling lousy yesterday afternoon and showtime was running the color purple
considering the limits of this film the entire movie in one setting a music studio only about 5 or 6 actors total it should have been much better made if you have these limits in making a film how could the lighting be so bad and the actors were terrible were talking a hair below the acting in clerks except that was an enjoyable movie this had no substance well it tried to but really fails br br it makes attempt to be self referencing in a couple parts but the lines were delivered so poorly by the actors it was just bad and the main character neal guy what a pathetic looser clearly like 10 people total made this 'film' and they all knew each other and it probably was a real rock band that they had but unfortuntly these people really have no idea how terrible they are all around this was made in 2005 but they all look so naieve it smacks of just pre grunge era br br thankfully i didn't pay to see this starz on demand delivers again but it was under the title the possessed not studio 666 it doesn't matter what you do to the title it can't help this this could have been a much better made movie there is no excuse for this bad film making when you have the obvious limited parameters the filmmakers had when they made this working within those limits you should make the stuff you can control and the stuff you can work with the best you can instead they figured mediocrity would be good enough and that music video wow that was bad i fast fowarded through that br br so 2 10 is fair if you are into the whole b movie crap i suppose you'll go and see this
this movie is utterly hilarious its cast clicks immediately with frame one and takes us on a wonderful ride through spoofing gangster films the conflict of brother vs brother appears when johnny's brother becomes a do gooder d a however the best character is johnny's crimelord rival the overly accented moroni as johnny says that man should be arrested for butchering the english language br br check it out on video it's worth a look
hmmm yeah this episode is extremely underrated br br even though there is a lot of bad writing and acting at parts i think the good over wins the bad br br i love the origami parts and the big 'twist' at the end i absolutely love that scene when michelle confronts tony it's actually one of my favorite scenes of season 1 br br for some reason people have always hated the reincarnation episodes yet i have always liked them they're not the best in terms of writing but the theme really does interest me br br i'm gonna give it a three star but if the writing were a little more consistent i'd give it four
for the longest time i liked this movie better than the original care bears movie well last summer i watched them both together and decided i was wrong the first one is a better care bears movie as you may have guessed if you read my review for it this one isn't a bad movie it's just very strange br br well first of all as a few people have mentioned it completely disavows any knowledge of the first movie i can't think of another sequel that contradicts the original so blatantly especially with the genders of some characters and how they all met when i was little and watching this i was quite a bit confused and distraught i felt the same way watching it as an adult br br on to the reasons why the movie is actually pretty good if you disassociate it from the first movie i can't think of another movie for little kids with a demon as it's villan now i am not for a minute suggesting that evil demons who want to steal the souls of campers and care bears are good i just find it cool that there's a supremely evil being in a movie for little kids it's like that bizzare santa clause vs satan movie from mexico you hear about sometimes br br anyhow the demon's name is darkheart and he wants this chick to help him get the care bears in return for him giving her special powers very dark for a kiddy flick eh and did i mention that darkheart appears to the girl most often as a whiney voiced 10 year old boy freaky meanwhile some other kids are in care a lot looking after baby care bears oh man demons and baby care bears in the same movie br br needless to say everything gets cleared up in the end but not before we get to see darkheart trap the care bears' souls in this scary chandelere thing in one surprisingly deeply disturbing scene but i am left with the question of wether this movie has found the cult audience it so richly deserves i might just watch it again myself
this is one of the worst film adaptations of a musical ever made the stage version of a chorus line is wonderful this movie misses the mark in almost every way even the casting is baffling take audrey landers as val dance 10 looks 3 is val's song val's story is that she is a great dancer but a 3 in the looks department yes she finds a solution but ultimately she's a great dancer what do the brilliant filmmakers do they hire an actress who can't dance and is famous for looking great way to miss the boat br br then there's the choreography i'm sure michael bennett was turning over in his grave why didn't they use his choreography it really can't be improved upon
as a cinema fan white noise was an utter disappointment as a filmmaker the cinematography was pretty good nicely lit good camera work reasonable direction but as a film it just seamed as predictable as all the other 'so called' horror movies that the market has recently been flooded with although it did have a little bit of the 'chill factor' the whole concept of the e v o electronic voice phenomena did'not seem believable this movie did not explain the reasonings for certain occurrences but went ahead with them the acting was far from mind blowing the main character portrayed no emotion like many recent thriller horror movies br br definitely not a movie i will be buying on dvd and would not recommend anyone rushes out to see it
i remember devil dog playing on tbs almost 20 years ago and my older sister and her friends watching it and laughing all the next day it's not that bad for a made for tv horror movie but it is derivative mostly of the exorcist and businesslike for lack of a better word it won't blow you away with artful cinematography or great acting but it's not a waste of time either it's the kind of movie you watch to kill a couple of hours when you aren't in the mood to think too hard br br however if you go into the movie looking for some laughs you won't be disappointed the early scenes with lucky the devil dog as a cute little puppy with children of the damned eyes are hilariously non threatening and the climactic blue screen effects of a giant black dog with horns are pretty side splitting and keep an eye out for the cloaked satanist in maverick shades toward the beginning br br not a great horror film by any stretch of the imagination but i wish they still made stuff like this for tv
a very promising directorial debut for bill paxton a very dark thriller who really done it recommended by stephen king this is a strong well conceived horror tale about a devout but demented man in thurman texas that goes on a murdering spree after getting orders from god to eliminate demons trying to control mankind a couple of plot twists and an eerie finale makes for your moneys worth most of the violence you don't really see but still enough to double up your stomach br br director paxton plays the twisted man to be known as the hand of god killer matthew mcconaughey is equally impressive as the demented man's eldest son that ends up telling this story to a dallas fbi agent powers boothe boothe as always is solid and flawless suspenseful white knuckler highly recommended
my husband rented this from a video store thinking it was suspense he never reads the synopsis br br well it would be funny if the thing was watchable it simply isn't the same thing over and over no intrigue and where did they find the leading man the leading man michael des barres is not even feasibly good looking especially for this role he is given also sexual harassment at work is something if you want to see rent michael crichton's disclosure at least michael douglas looked good in the early 90's br br alexandra paul who is usually watchable plays an embarrassing scene here there are also lighting effects cheaper than your at home web cam don't even waste time renting this 0 10
i grew up with this as my all time favorite film the special effects are incredible for the era and won awards i can remember the dialogue as if i'd heard it yesterday it is simply a great timeless adventure the music is by miklos rosza who is cinema history's best sabu is the thief conrad veidt is the grand villain i have a copy within reach for the next trip down memory lane whoa there rex ingram wants out of his genii bottle

what's with all the negative comments after having seen this film for the first time tonight i can only say that this is a good holiday comedy that is sure to brighten up any lonely person's day when i saw that drew ben affleck might end up spending the holidays alone i wanted to cry you'll have to see the movie if you want to know why also even though i liked tom james gandolfini and alicia christina applegate after awhile if you ask me they were real snobs however this film did make me smile and feel good inside before i wrap this up i'd like to say that mike mitchell has scored a pure holiday hit now in conclusion i highly recommend this good holiday comedy that is sure to brighten up any lonely person's day to any ben affleck or christina applegate fan who hasn't seen it
this is what makes me proud to be british this is by far the funniest thing on tv the league consists of jeremy dyson steve pemberton mark gatiss and the lovely reece shearsmith totally underrated this horror comedy is perfection the characters are iconic and the catchphrases bizarre hello dave it is a comedy that everyone simply must watch br br the best thing about the league of gentlemen is that it is always fresh and always pushing the boundaries it does not need to rely on catchphrases unlike little britain for it to be funny the fact that the league are willing to kill off arguably their most famous and iconic characters shows us that they've got balls of steel
i'm so confused i've been a huge seagal fan for 25 years i've seen all of his films and many of those dozens of times i can only describe this film as bizarre steven seagal shares screenplay writing and producing credits on this film but i have a really tough time believing he would choose to dub over his own voice for so many of his lines with a thin whiny imposter's voice no less what i also don't get is if they had to dub some of his lines why does his own voice appear on the rest of them i expect seagal to age like the rest of us but the seagal in this movie barely exudes a fraction of the same swagger confidence bravado charm and sex appeal he so easily showed us in all of his previous movies what i found myself missing most of all was his cocky self assured attitude and his bad ass sneer that so easily shifts into that adorable grin where is that in your face attitude and charm that made him such a huge star i hope that this film is not an indication of what seagal has left to offer us if so his lifelong fans will have to concede that the seagal we all knew and loved is gone
a mummy narrates vignettes about men women and the sex between them huh at the beginning the mummy randomly asks the viewer imagine having sex with this girl imagine having sex with this boy about 37 times while flashing pictures of half naked mod youths later said mods boys pelt mod girls with vegetables if you ignore or fast forward through the mummy's rambling the shorts aren't bad in their own right i found a few of them rather funny my personal favorite is one where the sexually confused man tries to convince a girl to have sex with him while his pet lizard sits on the bed this is one well bizarre movie
i own almost every seagal movie yes even ones like this that are low budget and i must say this may be the worst not only of his movies but of all movies ever made the only highlight of this film and only reason i gave it 2 stars instead of 1 is that a it is seagal and b seagal does have some sweet action sequences specifically in the store and also when ever else he takes out an entire army with a knife next time give me 90 minutes of seagal killing people and don't even bother with a story line because the storyline not only stunk but so did the acting the fact that f 18's and f 14's somehow changed into f 16s and also the fact that the stealth was as fast as an f 16 also the stealth never had to refuel and since when is afghanistan considered hostile territory from an air force stand point last i checked afghanistan has no air force we usa control the skies also this top secret mission was played through speakers to all the crew in the room yet the admiral still whispers to the other guy that it is secret also how did seagal go from the bottom of the truck to the top please tell us why they jailed him since when are air force pilots great commandos unless they are owen wilson and since when are their drunks in arab countries considering muslims don't drink alcohol also on top of that since when do arabs listen to orders from females like the 2 in charge the highlight of the film was definitely seagal killing people in the store and the other 50 people he killed with a knife as well as the very brief and totally random lesbian scene that came out of nowhere
i suppose i always felt that hotel du nord was studio bound the movement of people cars and camera were just too effortlessly smooth and stagey to have been filmed on location but no problem it's still a much underrated lovely composition from marcel carne the plot seems a bit choppy at times as if they were making it up as they went along but because it is unpredictable holds the attention to the bitter end the money shots when the 2 lovers are alone in their room are saddled with some rather stilted dialogue but it's all so lovely to fall into any inanity can be accepted are these 2 young people symbols of a cancerous hopelessness in pre war france or simply idiots suicide pacts are fairly common if the suicidees are young and healthy with their lives before them untrammelled would you think anything other than that they were just misguided fools br br arletty played the part of prostitute well she kept that zipper on her dress busy throughout anyway i've only seen a few films with jouvet he is the most impressive invention as pimp in hdn my trouble is shallow every time i see his face i think of sonnie hale in evergreen br br a remarkably atmospheric well acted and photographed film with so much happening it needs a few viewings to get it all in place annabella and aumont made an exceptionally beautiful couple francois heurtebise perier in his 2nd film had a small amusing part as a gay man all in all wonderful
well that's 90 minutes of my life i won't get back this movie makes teen tv show california dreams look like almost famous the acting was horrid and storyline unrealistic don't even get me started on the actual band at the forefront of this story lame songs look etc you had to believe that they were one of the hottest bands in the country and there isn't enough irony in the world to accept that one the guitarist is seen to be a heroin user not that i blame him if i was around such a putrid band with stale songs and wooden acting i'd be injecting the horse too br br if you take music remotely seriously avoid this at all costs
1999 will go down in history as the year the movie critic lead the general public astray first they sent us to eyes wide shut then they hyped up the blair witch project and now magnolia which is by far the worst movie of the year what is it about who the heck knows its full of self indulgence and loaded with bad acting i always like to stay and watch the credits but when this thing was over i couldn't get out of the movie theatre fast enough most of the audience that attended the showing that i was at felt pretty much the same way dates were arguing with each other as well as strangers it's an ugly and hateful film that will make you feel ugly and hateful
i don't give a movie or a show ten very often but this show touched a nerve in a way no other show has i found the entire series on mysoju com and thought the premise looked interesting so i took a look see i wasn't disappointed in what i saw i was moved this story stays on the tender side as the main characters move us through the scenes sumire iwaya played thoughtfully by koyuki shows us human nature as she wants to keep troubles from being shown no one really wants to lay their soul out in front of a perspective mate so instead she substitutes a human played by an adorable matsumoto jun as a pet this pet is like any other creature we would consider a pet the difference he can retaliate in the same way after all momo is a man not a dog as he is treated like a pet he reacts to situations how a dog might react she spends time with the new boyfriend momo gets jealous it's when she realizes that her pet isn't just a pet that the sexual tension between the two starts to become thick momo is a dance prodigy her thinking slowly changes as we start to get a glance at his own thoughts matsumoto takes us from seeing a character who is very one dimensional in the beginning to two dimensional when we see he's a dancer to a three dimensional character when we see him start to fall for his master as a man not as a dog in my opinion it's worth watching this story just to see this character develop plus matsumoto plays momo with such tenderness you almost start to wish you had one too neither wants to think about the future and how their relationship will change but as momo the name she gives him as one would name their new puppy states  we both knew this wasn't going to be able to last watch this show with a open mind it's worth it
as a habit i always like to read through the 'hated it' reviews of any given movie especially one that i'd want to comment on and it's not so much a point counterpoint sorta deal i just like to see what people say on the flipside br br however i do want to address one thing many people that hated it called it to paraphrase 'beautiful but shallow ' some even going so far as to say that norm's desire yet inability to help his brother was a mundane plot at best br br i'd like to disagree br br as a brother of a sibling who has a similar dysfunction i can relate daily you see them abuse themselves knowing only that their current path will inevitably lead them to self destruction and it's not about the specifics of what they did when how or why paul decided to take up gambling and associating with questionable folks it's really more how they are wired on one hand they are veritable geniuses and on the other painfully self destructive it's a lot like people like howard hughes  the same forces which drive them are the same forces which tear them apart and all the while you see this you know this and what's worse you realize you can't do a damn thing about it br br for norman maclean a river runs through it was probably a way to find an answer to why the tragedy had to occur and who was to blame in the end no one is and often there is no why but it takes a great deal of personal anguish to truly come to this realization sometimes it takes a lifetime and sometimes it never comes at all
it's a genuine shame that this spin off tv series inspired by the superior made for tv pictures the night stalker and the night strangler only lasted a single season and twenty episodes because at its best this program offered an often winning and highly entertaining blend of sharp cynical humor carl kolchak's spirited verbal sparring matches with perpetually irascible and long suffering editor tony vincenzo were always a treat to watch and hear clever writing nifty supernatural menaces gotta love the offbeat and original creatures in the spanish moss murders the sentry and horror in the heights plus you can't go wrong with such tried'n'true fright favorites as zombies vampires werewolves and witches colorful characters lively acting from a raft of cool guest stars legendary biker flick icon william smith got a rare chance to tackle a heroic lead in the energy eater while other episodes featured great veteran character actors like keenan wynn john fiedler john dehner severn darden and william daniels in juicy roles effective moments of genuine suspense the sewer set climax of the spanish moss murders in particular was truly harrowing and best of all the one and only darren mcgavin in peak zesty form as the brash aggressive and excitable but basically decent brave and honest small time chicago illinois newspaper reporter carl kolchak br br kolchak was the quintessential 70's everyman protagonist a wily and quick witted fellow with a strong nose for a tasty scoop and an unfortunate knack for getting into all kinds of trouble moreover the occasionally bumbling kolchak was anything but superhuman he usually either tripped or stumbled while running away from a deadly threat yet possessed a certain inner strength and courage that enabled him to save the human race time and time again from all kinds of lethal otherworldly foes kolchak was surrounded by a handful of enjoyable secondary characters simon oakland was perfect as carl's chronically ill tempered boss tony vincenzo jack grinnage as the prissy ron updyke made for an ideal comic foil ruth mcdevitt was simply delightful as the sweet miss emily cowles and carol ann susi was likewise a lot of fun as eager beaver rookie monique marmelstein who alas disappeared after popping up in only three episodes granted the show did suffer from lackluster make up and special effects the titular lycanthrope in the werewolf unfortunately resembles a yorkshire terrier and the latter episodes boasted a few laughably silly monsters the headless motorcyclist in chopper cathy lee crosby as helen of troy in the youth killer' but even the second rate shows are redeemed by the program's trademark wickedly sly sardonic wit and mcgavin's boundless vitality and engagingly scrappy presence
this is the biggest load of crap that i have seen in a long time the last time i hated a movie so much was whilst watching 28 days later and magnolia there is absolutely no point to this movie except to see some really sick and twisted sex rape scenes gillian anderson relieving herself on the side of the road and every single sentence of dialog having to use the f word at least a couple of times in it it has extremely cheap acting and is very low budget my friend and i eventually turned off the movie after about half an hour we had tried to give it a chance but nothing could save this crud do not watch it
mary lou is a slut whose spirit seeks revenge on those who let her come to her fiery doom back in 1957 br br well the movie mainly takes place in 1986 the movie falls into the 80's trap of weird stupid special effects including some weird demented looking rocking horse br br anyway mary lou's spirit does bad things to people and tries to take over one person's body whether or not she succeeds you'll have to watch to find out br br anyway the movie is largely boring and based around a bunch of worthless characters this also isn't really a sequel the only thing in common with the first is the name of the high school it has the avg horror flick fall backs gore pointless nudity knocks against the catholic church basic stuff boring movie br br the acting is decent enough to give it a 3 out of 10 you can waste your time doing something else
may seem like an overstatement but it is not br br what is so hard to comprehend is why didn't they make more musical shorts like this wasn't the beauty of it totally apparent to everybody involved i guess not so many shorts were made for commercial reasons only and with some luck there may be some artistic value in there this is one exception the only one where it seems they were the director had a vision and clearly could appreciate the music as art why didn't anybody ever think to shoot lester or charlie parker on a live date crazy man br br a pity there were no sequels if you've seen anything of similar quality please share it
i was shocked by the ridiculously unbelievable plot of tigerland it was a liberal's fantasy of how the military should be the dialogue was difficult to swallow along with the silly things colin farrell's character was allowed to get away with by his superior officers br br i kept thinking hey there's a reason why boot camp is tough it's supposed to condition soldiers for battle and turn them into one cohesive unit there's no room for cocky attitudes and men who won't follow orders i was rooting for bozz to get his butt kicked because he was such a danger to his fellow soldiers i would not want to fight alongside someone like him in war because he was more concerned with people's feelings than with doing what was necessary to protect his unit br br br br
ok not bad movie making if it were from an original script but it is not br br which part of in this story there are no women except for foulata and gagoola introduction by haggard did the producers directors and writers not understand i mean it is pretty plain english i understood it at age 10 the beauty of ksm is that it contains a spectacular description of three different worlds the colonial africa the unforgiving desert and kukuanaland a hidden and isolated kingdom that should be more than enough for even the most mediocre of producers to work with but nooo they have to throw romance into it pathetic suggestion to all you poor souls who actually thought this would be close to the book give it up until a peter jackson wannabe comes along and does it right you may as well keep re reading the tome btw there is a sequel book actually a pre quel called allan's wife it gives background to the story of quatermain it is a bit creepy but good
i rank this the best of the zorro chapterplays the exciting musical score adds punch to an exciting screen play there is an excellent supporting cast and mystery villain that will keep you guessing until the final chapter reed hadley does a fine job as don diego and his alter ego zorro last but certainly not least is the great directing team of whitney and english
one of the worst movies i've ever seen acting was terrible both for the kids and the adults most to all characters showed no little or not enough emotion the lighting was terrible and there were too many mess ups about the time of the day the film was shot in the river scene where they just get their boat destroyed there's 4 shots the sheriff and dad in the evening on their boat jillian and molly in the evening swimming the rest of the kids in the daytime when it's supposed to in the evening at the river bank and the doctor beatrice and simonton at night but not in the evening getting off their boat the best acting in the movie was probably from the sheriff cappy although there's a slip of character when the pulse detector whatever that thing is when people die it beeps shows cappy has died he still moves while it can still be heard beeping and while the nurse extra checks his pulse manually then it shows the pulse again and then he finally dies i guess it's not going to be perfect since it's an independent movie but it still could be better not worth watching honestly even for kids might as well watch something good like the lion king or toy story if you're going to see anything you'll remember
i'm not at all picky about horror movies and i'm willing to watch pretty much any of them that doesn't mean that i'm willing to re watch many of them or that i won't have criticism for them this movie is creepy and is very well done in fact i think this movie would make an excellent double bill with session 9 br br i should specify before i get to my comments that i watched this alone i started watching it before going to bed and got about 15 minutes in before i realized that it was too effective so i saved the rest of it for the morning even while watching it in broad daylight it was still creepy however i can't vouch for how effective it would be when watching in a larger group br br after the death of their daughter a couple move to a remote cabin as a means of trying to come to terms with this death let me make note of this death this is one of the rare movies that doesn't shy away from the death of a child this is much more important as it both sets the tone as well as explains much of the acting that permeates the movie br br the couple is not doing well the wife has distanced herself from the relationship and the husband is doing what he can to try to bring her back while some of the comments have complained about their acting one specified that they act more like a father and daughter than husband and wife and that's legitimate he's trying to give her more direction it's a role that men sometimes take on br br there are a variety of scares in the film and most are fairly non violent though grotesque in some ways the story itself feels very straightforward for most of the film and takes an odd turn near the end while the turn is not absurd it is certainly not what you expected from the way things had been progressing br br moody atmospheric and very well done for something that appears to have been shot on video
ever since i remember i have loved airplanes and flying i am now in college with a private pilot's license and looking to become a commercial i could never remember why i was so obsessed with the subject until i came across my old tail spin tapes in my basement at home and it hit me this was it my parents bought every single tape they had and this was the only show i would watch as a kid i had the theme memorized as i grew up and i can still re cite it today it is absolutely amazing and i plan on buying the dvd's soon it really is great for children and adults and is absolutely timeless i cannot get enough of this show
if my expectations weren't exceeded they were certainly met nancy drew works both as a mystery and a comedy it pays homage to the books it was based on and spoofs them at the same time the movie starts with a close up on a book shelf and an animated credit sequence resembling illustrations from the books it then begins lampooning the books immediately writer director andrew fleming seems to realize the idea of a teenage girl regularly breaking up crime rings in a small town is ridiculous so he doesn't treat the idea religiously he pokes fun at nancy drew's ability to do anything such as ace every class in school know which baked treat is perfect for converting any enemy to her side make a bird house with twelve flying buttresses and even perform an emergency tracheotomy at a party nancy'd always be in perfect style if she were living in the wholesome 1950's instead of present day l a and she carries around a sleuth kit complete with fingerprinting dust flashlight compass and magnifying glass preposterous of course but i seem to remember the hardy boys' access at any given moment to csi equipment being a little too convenient as well and if the perky pipsqueak private eye is a little younger than her literary counterpart it's just more comedic exaggeration on the movie's part br br the mystery of the movie is handled more seriously nancy and her lawyer father move from their small town to los angeles where nancy digs into a cold case involving the murder of a hollywood movie star who lived in her new house decades ago nancy searches for clues in some pretty practical ways such as surfing websites like google and this one and watching old videotapes of the victim's movies when she does something more out of the ordinary you have to admire the girl's resourcefulness emma roberts an undeniably cute kid plays the pint sized amateur sleuth beautifully she makes the too perfect girl completely lovable if not completely realistic tate donovan is also great as the too perfect girl's father carson drew he's an ideal father figure without being unrealistically perfect and he shows reasonable concern for his daughter as she gets into danger less likable is max thierot's take on ned nickerson nancy's boyfriend i much preferred george o'hanlon jr 's portrayal in the 1970's tv series starring pamela sue martin as nancy drew in which ned was a gawky awkward kid with a little crush on nancy the character of corky josh flitty a twelve year old with a crush on nancy is much less annoying than max thierot's ned amy bruckner and kay panabaker seem appropriately cast as nancy's gal pals bess and george but they only make brief cameos at the beginning of the film br br speaking of cameos chris kattan snl eddie jemison ocean's 13 and bruce willis all make surprise guest appearances which just proves you never can guess which movie bruce willis will pop up in next br br the movie does fail to live up to some potential it's mentioned early on that the drews' new house is heavily booby trapped but nancy and her father are done with tripping over booby traps a few minutes after that also nancy describes the cold case she's about to investigate as a murder taking place at an extravagant party which should yield plenty of potential murderers but she only encounter a handful of suspects and while there's some moments of real suspense during nancy's adventures the solution to the case comes out of nowhere and in the end all possible plot threads are tied up too conveniently and who cares who done it ralph sall's score adds to the movie's suspense but the contemporary teenybopper songs woven into the soundtrack are lame still i really enjoyed this film and while the movie is aimed primarily at tween girls people of any age and gender can enjoy it
all good movies inspire some direct to video copycat flick i was afraid that gladiator wasn't really that good a film because i hadn't seen any movie that had anything remotely resembling anything roman on the new releases shelf for months then i spotted full moon's latest offering demonicus i'm a fan of full moon's puppetmaster series and blood dolls but had never seen one of their non killer puppet films anyway br br demonicus chronicles what happens to a group of campers in the mountains of the alps one of the campers james finds a cave with old gladiator artifacts and feels impelled to remove a helmet from a corpse and try it on he becomes possessed and as the demonic gladiator tyrannus is impelled to kill his friends to revive the corpse who is the real tyrannus br br granted like many full moon films this has little or no budget at times the editing and direction was so amateurish i'd swear i was watching the blair witch project the attempts at chopping off of limbs and heads reminds me of a monty python skit the weapons although apparently real look really plastic y it literally looks like this was filmed by a group of friends with a digital camcorder on a weekend granted there's nothing wrong with such film making just don't rent this expecting a technical masterpiece it looks like there were attempts at research for the script too because even though tyrannus really doesn't act much like a gladiator until the end at least he speaks latin br br all trashing aside i actually enjoyed this film not as much as a killer puppet film perhaps but full moon still delivers the only thing that disappointed me was there was no full moon videozone at the end
but sadly due to rights issues that almost certainly will never happen transcripts of joe bob's commentary on the sub b movies he screened are available on the internet but they don't quite capture his twang inflected delivery which was a real hoot nowadays joe bob real name john bloom is confined to doing the supplemental features of such classics as i spit on your grave featuring what some exploitation fans call the greatest gang rape on film of all time and jason x one of the most reviled friday the 13th sequels of all time the series was never the same once it left paramount all i could think when they canceled it was damn where else am i going to get my fill of flesh ripping blonde jokes and horror trivia every saturday night does this mean i have to get a life now sadly it does but there'll always be a place in my horror hungry heart for monstervision long live the drive in
much underrated camp movie on the level of cobra woman etc photographic stills resemble rembrandt prints sometimes subtle dialog and hidden literate touches found throughout
1st watched 12 26 2008 dir eugene levy corny comedy murder mystery with very few laughs the movie appears to be based on an earlier italian movie according to the credits but was re written by two fairly popular american romantic comedy writers but this one by charles shyer nancy meyers does not cut it compared to their other efforts the story is about a couple of down and out traveling americans played by richard lewis and sean young who stumble upon a lost dog and hope to make a fortune in reward money after seeing an ad in the paper for the dachsund's return upon trying to return it they see a hand sticking out of a garage door at the lady's residence that they believe is attached to the rest of the dead body of the woman who is supposed to give them the money they freak out and instead of contacting the police and telling them the truth they make out like runaways from the scene expecting to be framed for the murder the other characters in the film are met on a train prior to this and hang around a monte carlo gambling resort doing various things to be pulled into the story the other cast members include character actors john candy james belushi cybill shepherd george hamilton and others after the police find out about the death they start questioning the main characters and of course they have to work thru their goofy lies to figure out what really happened none of the character actors mentioned earlier can bring this movie out of it's mediocre state despite some funny moments mostly provided by the belushi shepherd couple this isn't a horrible movie it just isn't that good there are plenty of average movies out there and this is just another one for the pile try it maybe you'll like it probably you won't
tim krabbe is the praised author of 'het gouden ei' a novel that was put on the screen twice 'spoorloos' and 'the vanishing' one of the dutch writer's more recent works is 'de grot' a psychological thriller about two totally different men egon and axel who meet at a youth camp and surprising enough become friends for dear life egon is a quiet somewhat dull person who spends his time studying and writing geography books axel on the other hand is a charismatic 'party animal' a heavy drinking criminal whose everyday's concern is to get a woman into his bedroom from the moment they meet axel has a strong influence on egon while the latter envies him because he has a good life without really doing anything such as reading thick books like egon ultimately egon is even dragged by egon into illegal practices himself which leads to a fatal drug transport in a distant asian country br br after having read the book last year i was surprised the critics were quite positive about it in my opinion the book suffers especially from the complex structure while krabbe presents the story as an absorbing portrait of an uncommon relationship between two people the plot becomes more of a puzzle the many episodes are not presented chronologically so that two successive scenes are seldom in the same episode because of this the story feels surprisingly remote you often need to know a character's background to really care for him or her another complaint was the fact that the main characters egon and axel are a little stereotypical egon is 'the' dull intellectual while axel is his exact opposite in real life such one dimensional people rarely exist in books and films they always seem to be there taking away a lot of credibility br br despite all this the film was a pleasant surprise being much better than the book the adaptation excels in its beautiful cinematography humour and acting fedja van huet egon is one of the few dutch actors who can make you forget he is acting which is in my opinion the highest an actor can achieve the drawbacks of the film however are the same as the book's mainly because the characters are one dimensional they are so predictable that it becomes annoying guess who wrote the script indeed krabbe himself it is obvious that this talented director that's what the movie makes clear anyway is hampered by a deficient screenplay perhaps koolhoven should just have chosen a better book br br 7 10
i gave it a 10 since everyone else seemed to like it and it would have been churlish not to the reason i'm troubling you is to add a personal observation on castle's work br br i've seen homicidal and the tingler the version with the clever colour sequence where everything except the blood is in black and white a few times and the house on haunted hill many times br br even i am not old enough to have seen them when castle was up to his showman tricks thus i can appreciate them for their own merit and while most pass him off as second rate schlocky hammy etc i believe they do him a disservice br br the end sequence of homicidal is genuinely shocking and works today and the premise of the tingler while silly was highly original br br but the house on haunted hill was a triumph having used that frank lloyd wright house as its exterior the great vincent price and a solid cast plus a good score and production values when i first saw it at a packed late night showing in the late sixties it produced an audience reaction i'd not seen before and have not seen since br br it was the bit where the heroine is alone in the basement if you've not seen the film stop reading now and we are waiting to hear the hero on the other side of the wall br br with no telegraphing of what is coming the camera slowly pulls back forcing the audience to switch their gaze to i'm saying no more my spoiler declaration above only covers this movie br br the point is i believe this ploy was deliberate not accidental and when it happened the whole audience screamed including most of the men it took the audience about ten minutes to calm down br br now that is superior film making a flamboyant showman he might have been but house and the other two films i've mentioned were good movies castle may not have been a hitchcock but he was no ed wood either br br it's easy to concentrate on someone's quirks and forget to examine their talent so i hope this documentary acknowledged that i look forward to seeing it
zero day leads you to think even re think why two boys young men would do what they did commit mutual suicide via slaughtering their classmates it captures what must be beyond a bizarre mode of being for two humans who have decided to withdraw from common civility in order to define their own mutual world via coupled destruction br br it is not a perfect movie but given what money time the filmmaker and actors had it is a remarkable product in terms of explaining the motives and actions of the two young suicide murderers it is better than 'elephant' in terms of being a film that gets under our 'rationalistic' skin it is a far far better film than almost anything you are likely to see br br flawed but honest with a terrible honesty
presenting lily mars may have provided judy garland with one of the easier roles she had while at mgm because lily mars is definitely a character she could identify with a young girl with talent enough for ten she knows she has what it takes to make it in the theater no matter how much producer van heflin from her home town discourages her br br i really liked judy in this one as the girl determined to make it in the theater because it is judy garland with the talent of judy garland you in the audience know she has the right stuff even if it takes van heflin nearly the whole movie to be convinced br br both judy and heflin hail from the same small town heflin's dad was the town doctor who delivered her and heflin while he may have moved away and become a big producer on broadway their respective moms fay bainter and spring byington have kept in touch that's her entrée but heflin's constantly barraged with stagestruck kids but never anyone quite like lily mars br br no real big song hits came out of presenting lily mars for garland though she sings all her numbers the best in the film is a revival of that gaslight era chestnut every little movement has a meaning all its own judy sings it with connie gilchrist playing the cleaning lady in a broadway theater where heflin's show is being produced gilchrist was a star back in the days of the floradora girls and she and judy deliver the song in grand style with connie it's the best scene in the film as gilchrist encourages judy to keep at it composer karl hoschna had died a long time ago but lyricist otto harbach was still alive and i'm betting he liked what he heard br br european musical star marta eggerth is in presenting lily mars as the show's star who's at first bemused then angry and finally understanding of garland and heflin she did a couple of films with mgm and then went back to europe for more work on the continent i'm betting mgm didn't quite know what to do with her and her thick hungarian accent though louis b mayer never met a soprano he didn't like br br van heflin does well as the patient producer who puts up with a lot from garland and eggerth heflin was just coming off his oscar for johnny eager the previous year and he and garland wouldn't appear to be an ideal screen team but they're not bad together br br presenting lily mars is a fine showcase for the talents of judy garland and she didn't have to share the screen in another backstage film with mickey rooney
br br entrails of a virgin is so bizarre and incomprehensible that it allows the viewer to interpret it subjectively applying whatever meaning he wishes to its inexplicable excesses of sex and violence if this was an intentional characteristic of the film it would be a work of postmodern brilliance but of course it isn't br br without getting too much into plot summary let's take a quick walking tour of the events at a secluded cabin an orgy is in progress which includes topless wrestling and diaper p ing a vanload of latecomers joins the orgy in progress but they have unwittingly been followed by a monster i like to call the muddy ninja this monster precedes to slay orgy participants one by one except the proverbial virgin if you don't count oral sex who receives his seed and consequently becomes so passionate with desire that she masturbates with someone's severed hand br br finally she has her guts pulled out and then there's a scene which seems to imply that she's pregnant with a baby muddy ninja got all that if you're going to rent this movie it's best if you don't speak japanese and don't have any subtitles in a season populated by boring hollywood flicks putting this in your vcr might be the cinematic equivalent of shock therapy it will certainly be something different
there were some scary scenes which i've always liked more than straight out gore but otherwise this movie was rather weak there were too many questions left unanswered and when they tried to explain anything in the movie it was still rather unclear after watching this movie i still seemed lost in a lot of ways it sort of reminded me of silent hill a few years back that movie was also unsatisfying but still better than this because it did try to work and the story did actually make sense this one not so much br br the acting for the most part in the abandoned was decent but the movie dragged on an on and never really gave any type of satisfying conclusion like i said above there were some creepy scenes but otherwise this movie was a mess sorry i can't recommend it
fragglerock is excellent in the way that schindler's list was excellent a great watch for children and adults of all genders big noses can be seen as hinting towards phallic symbols in the same way that h r puff n stuff had hinted towards marijuana smoking your kids will love this movie i enjoyed it very much as a child my father showed me this movie as a child he enjoyed it as well and pointed out that the exaggerated noses were phallic symbols although at the time i had no clue about what those were the movie is comedy and adventure the storyline is wacky and cheerful i and you shall enjoy this together
why this was an insipid uninspired and embarrassing film the embarrassment comes from being from the city where they made it pittsburgh pa why did they let these people do such a baaaaad movie there br br when this movie was originally to be released it was more of a romantic comedy and no robo anything that all got changed along with cuteness courtesy of disney why they did a terrible interpretation of this classic comic character seeing matthew broderick make fun of his own movies was not fun either sheesh
at the beginning of the film you might double check the dvd cover and re read the synopsis a couple of times but no worries it's not memoirs of a geisha that you purchased just a movie with an intro that is much more classy and stylish than it has any right to be still the opening is by far the best thing about the entire movie as it shows how in the year 1840 a samurai sword master catches his wife committing adultery he decapitates the two lovers before doing some hara kiri ritual suicide through disembowelment cut to present day when the american ambassador in japan welcomes a befriended family and drives them up to the same house where the aforementioned slaughter took place nearly one and a half century ago from then onwards this becomes a seemingly routine haunted house flick yet the utterly retarded and implausible script still makes it somewhat exceptional let's start with the good aspects namely the original japanese setting and the presence of the delicious susan george who is my all time favorite british horror wench well together with britt eckland linda hayden and ingrid pitt the bad aspects simply include that the screenplay is incoherent imbecilic beyond repair and full of supposedly unsettling twists that only evoke laughter the restless spirits of the house soon begin to entertain themselves by perpetrating into the bodies of the new tenants and causing them to do and say all sorts of crazy stuff the spirit of the massacred adulterous woman particularly enjoys squeezing into susan's ravishing booty and transforming her into a lewd seductress in this possessed state she even lures the american ambassador outside to have sex in the garden of a high society diner party full of prominent guests so strictly spoken it's not really evil that dwells in the house just a trio of sleazy ghosts with dirty minds and far too much free time on their long dead hands obviously these scenes are more comical than frightening especially since the light blue and transparent shapes remind you of the cute ghost effects that were later popularized in ghostbusters the house where evil dwells is probably the least scary ghost movie ever throughout most of the running time you'll be wondering whether director kevin connor who nevertheless made the excellent horror films motel hell and from beyond the grave intentionally wanted to make his movie funny and over the top like motel hell maybe but then again everyone in the cast continues to speak his her lines with a straight and sincere face so i guess we are nevertheless supposed to take everything seriously and feel disturbed the house where evil dwells is never suspenseful or even remotely exciting and it doesn't even contain any grisly images apart from the massacre at the beginning i am fully aware of how shallow it sounds but the two scenes in which susan george goes topless are the only true highlights well those and maybe also the invasion of cheesy and ridiculously over sized spiders or are they crabs in the daughter's bedroom how totally random and irrelevant was that if you ever decide to give this movie a chance notwithstanding its bad reputation make sure you leave your common sense and reasoning at the doorstep br br trivia note for horror buffs keep an eye open for the demon mask that was also a pivot piece of scenery in the brilliant japanese horror classic onibaba
well it was funny in spots this film is a 4 or maybe a 3 its a film that sits on the video shelf and gathers dust rent this one after you seen everything else beats boredom but not by that much my wife like like this film better then i do maybe its not that bad
i saw the movie last night and i really wanted to like it my expectations for the movie had been going up and down ever since i heard it was being made some days i'd see something spectacular and some days i'd be disappointed br br yet being the kind of fan i am i had high hopes for this movie but in the end i was sorely disappointed br br while i love the richard donner movies i didn't like their sometimes campy nature or the changes they made to superman's character and his powers br br singer however chose to take the worst elements of the donner movies and put them in his version br br while his lex luthor is slightly darker he's still nothing more than a shyster a conman and a common criminal he's no more intelligent than when gene hackman played him kevin spacey does his best to play luthor well but ultimately he falls victim to shoddy writing and unremarkable dialog br br his henchmen are more two dimensional than even comic book henchmen most of them literally have no dialog in the movie br br spoilers ahead kitty kowalski is almost exactly the same character as ms tesmacher she seems to be as evil and cold as lex luthor but she proves to be just an underling who melts after seeing superman in trouble and quite predictably betrays luthor br br the biggest disappointment in the movie was frank langella as perry white i wasn't a huge fan of the over the top perry white in the donner movies but at least he had a soul he was after all said and done a veteran reporter who cared about the truth and a good story langella's perry white is nothing but a corporate stooge he wants everyone to concentrate on the superman related stories because they sell papers even though every other paper is doing the same thing he doesn't care about the real stories the real mysteries like the black out and what lex luthor is up to now that he's out of prison br br the worst thing about langella is that he's dull some actors can be quiet and sober and yet have an undercurrent that lets you know that still waters run deep frank langella is puddle br br brandon routh is not a bad actor he's ok but again there is not a single memorable line in the whole movie not the actor's fault his movements are clearly meant to look graceful like even the slightest movement of his fingers effects the way he flies but it still looks choreographed and artificial br br lois lane while badly written was surprisingly well acted by kate bosworth unfortunately again for a pulitzer prize winning journalist and writer she is about as eloquent as any teenage on dawson's creek br br james marsden was my favorite actor in the whole movie mostly because he looks more like superman than even routh without any superpowers he manages to figure out lois lane's message flies a plane to the location gets on board luthor's yacht and rescues lois and her son br br the only moving moment in the movie is when they are all trapped pantry as it is flooding with water and the ship is sinking you see them slowly going being immersed in the water you know superman's going to come by at the last moment to rescue them but still you can't help but feel sorry for them br br as i said before the plot is very haphazard unlike singer has said this is not a movie about a superhero returning and trying to find his place in the world as soon as he returns the world welcomes him back with open arms lois is the only one who's not happy to see him back even luthor is happy to have superman back because it gives him a chance to settle the score with the man of steel br br superman is shown to be probably one of the dumbest heroes in the universe a big green piece of meteorite is stolen from a museum lex luthor is out of prison he now has knowledge about superman's powers and weaknesses and yet he's still not able to connect the dots enough to know luthor would be using kryptonite against him br br according to the movie the only thing superman is good for is lifting really really heavy things the action sequences are all incredibly predictable
i am surprised at imdb's low rating of this movie with all due respect its low rating is representative of the iq level of those who rated it so poor they would rather see a movie with cheap thrills a bigger budget and more gore br br the first misconception by people is that this is a horror film it is not nor does the film mislead you into believing it is one it is a psychological thriller it is for people who actually want an intellectual experience when watching a movie reel com's review is the perfect example of how i feel about this movie all the other negative reviews doesn't make much sense it's almost as if trying to make an original movie for a change very rare these days is something bad and not worth it br br i will reveal some spoilers for the morons who said it was boring and didn't make sense martha was brainwashing herself and performing experiments on herself to be a caring mother while she really was an evil nazi who would kill without warning the evidence is all in the pudding and the fact that at first viewing we sympathize with this cold blooded monster for the duration of the movie is a testament to the film's direction and writing br br i definitely feel that this movie should at least be rated in the 6's range on originality alone i recommend this movie for the people on the other end of the iq scale aka smart people since this movie is obviously being butchered by those who would rather watch scream or freddy's nightmare br br kudos to the acting as well for such a low budget film you are amazed that this movie didn't hit your local cinema with the great direction writing and acting please don't be fooled by the rating by imdb this movie is worth it i actually recommend buying the film since a first viewing on a rent will not do this justice
whattt was with the sound it sounded like it was all dubbed br br otherwise bad plot bad accents bad even dougray and we live in scotland acting bad harp bad sex scenes bad cringeworthy br br still we watched it until the end in disbelief how could such a good roll call of actors perform so badly will they ever get a decent job again br br bad bad bad by the way we gave it 3 because we at least were enticed to watch it to the end due to its bizarre plot etc br br and to the older reviewer i totally agree it was like a romantic farce from the 1940s how did it get made in 2004 br br ok ok there were some ok bits they had a nice house in bristol dougray had a nice boat jennifer looked nice in a little outfit but how come the sister got all the men
i wondered why john wood was not playing dr falken until i watched the film bad plot bad science bad acting and overall a bad film please don't watch this film rent the original war games if you are feeling nostalgic br br i didn't like the bending of the plot to beat the terrorist threat idea either in the first film w o p r was built because russia had 1000s of warheads pointed at the u s a in this film the idea behind the computer was to kill terrorist in training before they are a threat politics aside one of the good thing about the first film was the highlighting that even a stupid computer could grasp the idea of the pointlessness of war in the end no such insight is offered in this film
i enjoyed this movie as a kid when it came out and to this day still do a simple story involving the search for a kidnapped girl and an adventurer literally straight out of paperback lore it has actors that were more recognizable back in the day this shouldn't keep the viewer from giving it a whirl wayne crawford stars as the main character jake speed sure it might bite from certain elements of romancing the stone and indiana jones but this movie is done well enough to keep it out of the cellar i am surprised not too many people know about it it must have been overshadowed by other movies in the theaters back in '86 i watched it back then on cable tv it might be hard to find since it's out of print on both vhs and dvd i managed to get a dvd from ebay at less than 8 bucks cool flick
nick and kelly are ready to be married but travis kelly's dog leads nick to a strange blue wall that will change the honeymoon for kelly richard burgi and susan walters play nick and kelly and make a good couple nick loves to drink smoke and play pool with the fellas for fun but nick suddenly abstains from this type of fun sex is the one thing that he loves because he wants a child we find out that an alien race is dying and needs to interbreed with women from earth to save their population it becomes a battle of survival between humans and aliens with the dog population also being involved a fine film
the crater lake monster is easily one of the most awful amateurish film i've ever seen ranking right up there with manos the hands of fate in terms of poor acting useless direction and kindergarten level production values in this movie a silly looking claymation stop motion animated dinosaur wakes up after a meteor hits a lake in bumblebum ca and begins dining on the local hayseeds in the thrilling climax the creature described by one local as a giant alligator with flippers drags it's ponderous bulk over the ground to chase its would be lunch before a bulldozer bumps it a couple of times it dies from boredom every character in this moovie is a complete moron one pointless subplot shows a hick go into a liquor store to purchase a 4 75 pint of ripple instead of simply buying the bottle the idiot shoots the cashier and another bystander shoots at a cop gets chased towards the lake all so that he can eaten by the monster unfortunate close ups of the monster reveal it to be nothing more than a piece of styrofoam there's a fake magician struggling with a phony british accent to make him seem more legit two overly bumbling redneck boat renters some cheesy pre historic cave art done in crayon and annoying banjo pickin' background moosic in one painful scene the fake magician and his dopey wife girlfriend accomplice manage to pad the movie an extra 4 minutes by cowmenting on how may stars they can see in the night sky even though it is clearly day time still even on constant fast forward this moovie hurts and hurts bad moocow says call the fumigators 'cause this cow pie really stinks 8p
i rented this back in the 80's and honestly can't remember anything specific about the movie only that it is the worst movie i have ever seen this isn't one of those it was so bad it was funny this isn't one of those it was so gory it leaves you with a bad feeling movies it wasn't even one of those what the heck was that movies i can't recall the performance of the actors but it was poorly shot the story was disjointed and it had no definable style when it was over i was angry that i had wasted the time br br i've seen plenty of movies i didn't understand because of unfamiliar cultures styles and or story telling but it was clear that those movies had some of those properties the incubus has none br br i actually contemplated not making a comment on this piece for fear that someone may watch it out of curiosity but i am compelled to warn anyone who appreciates film to skip this movie
besides all of the technical mistakes br br how about a female flight attendant who's able to kill all by herself 4 out of the 7 terrorists including ex marines 2 of whom without even using a gun then she lands the plane perfectly we're not talking about sigourney weaver or linda hamilton we're talking about a regular frightened yet very well composed flight attendant d how about the leader in charge of the assault rescue squad having a full proof according to the logic of the script plan of sleep gassing everyone and having someone from his team fly the plane only he decides at the spur of the moment to change plans and instead lead an attack on the terrorists guns blazing not knowing where the terrorists are or how many and not securing a position of advantage so that his whole team gets easily wiped out yeah that's using the old noggin only later to decide to use the sleep gas anyway and it turns out useless for all intensive purposes br br bad as this movie was though i couldn't stop myself from watching and wondering what next d i can't help but imagine all the excellent unemployed script writers thinking to themselves it's not fair lol d
i saw the movie recently during the boston film festival the movie was very entertaining and is something that i believe the world and black america is ready to see it has comedy drama the soundtrack is great it is an all around good film the characters were well developed and the movie had a wide variety of prominent actors such as wood harris remember the titains paid in full brian j white trois 3 mr 3000 and the wonderful zoe saldana drumline pirates of the caribbean the movie tackles many relevant topics in todays society in a short period of time and does so with class and grace this is not only a story about life in the hospital however it is a story about people and their personal journey to discovering who they are or who they are going to be
or marlowe at sea yet another ridiculously overrated old film with bogey quite talky too bogey basically plays the same character as in the marlow films always in control of a situation never nervous no matter how dangerous a situation calls women slim and dames and other such nonsense is the only real male i e alpha male in the movie the only other alpha male male being the head of gestapo but he is only a fat alpha male male and naturally every attractive young woman who comes his way cannot resist his charms and wants his penis within hours of their initial introduction the character clichés are all here bogey is supposed to be the same type of cynic about to reform as in casablanca and naturally he often refuses money or other valuables when being offered them but how does that fit in with the tough cynic in him it doesn't so he can't be a cynic hawks wanted it both ways a character who is both the cool lone cynic and yet a well meaning humanitarian i don't think so bacall does her non chalant cool babe routine for the first time and there are plenty of overrated not all too interesting so called sexual innuendo exchanges between her and bogey these dialogues sound silly by today's standards just purse your lips and whistle a load of crap she was 19 when this was made but looks a lot older and is far less attractive than the female stars of the day her bony face with its sharp features is nowhere even close to radiating the kind of feminine beauty of a de havilland the cuteness of a myrna loy let alone the likability of an irene dunne bacall was more suited for playing vampires not femme fatales in real life she is very much like her face a hollywood bitch there is a scene in which bacall breaks into tears very unsuitable for her character there are two or three bad musical numbers but my fast forward button was ready br br if you're interested in reading my biographies of bogart bacall huston and other hollywood personalities contact me by e mail
i saw this movie in 1979 i was 17 or 18 when it was released the theater was perhaps 1 4 full when the movie started ten minutes into the movie me and the friend who went with me to see the film were the only two people in the theater the movie was really weird and had no plot or reason to its script and people demanded their money back we decided to stay for the entire movie why endure such torture here's why we wanted to be true movie critics to have a standard to base all other movies on it is hard to justify saying you have seen the best movie a 10 they always come up with something better but it is easy to be able to base all other movies off of the worst movie ever made and this is it a 1 at best there may be other movies out there that truly qualify as a 1 but i have yet to see them i now base all movies i see on a scale based on this worst i am a true movie critic he he
a difficult film to categorize i was never giving it 110 concentration consequently as simple as the plot appeared i couldn't say for certain exactly who was doing what amongst the american fbi characters what their roles were nor could i take the irwins seriously as film characters when their lines scenes were all in the style of one of his shows not acted out br br this is nothing more than a glorified episode of a discovery tv show with a largely insignificant sub plot going on which just seemed to get in the way however as any irwin show is always worth a watch this film is well worth a look too but not on christmas day talking of which i've better things to do too than be on here br br a high 4 10
slackers is just another teen movie that's not really worth watching dave devon sawa sam jason segel and jeff michael c maronna are about to graduate from holden university with honors in lying cheating and scheming the three roommates have proudly scammed their way through the last four years of college and now during final exams these big men on campus are about to be busted by the most unlikely dude in school the plot is very stupid and there's no reason why to watch this unless your looking to shut off you brain for a little while slackers is just a predictable teen flick that really adds nothing new to the genre the comedy in slackers is either hit or miss but there's no real true funny or original moment in the movie its really just a collection of gags and some are actually pretty funny though for every joke that works there's at least eight more that don't the screenplay is full of penis and breast jokes that some high school and college students may enjoy even if they do they probably won't remember this film after awhile as its not a very memorable comedy jason schwartzman plays the freaky ethan and after appearing in some good comedies he has stoop pretty low jaime king and devon sawa are the other main stars but they do a rather poor job in this film this is directed by dewey nicks and this is his first film so you can't blame him too much the funniest character was probably laura prepon though she's not in the movie very much the film is very short at only 86 minutes long however that may be too long for some people who don't really like this type of humor slackers isn't the worst film of 2002 but certainly is below average when compared to other films in the genre there's a lot better out there such as not another teen movie american pie and its sequels scary movie 1 2 etc so unless you have seen most of them and you're looking for something new then slackers might fit that bill but its better if you just watch something else rating 4 3 10 a below average teen comedy that's worth skipping
honestly i find this film almost too depressing for my own good it is very depressing until pretty much the very end there is no way i can justify passing judgement to any character who did things i didn't like well except for the disgusting character played by fredrick forrest but it's still so frustrating to see people behaving this way putting up walls around themselves when just a word or so could break the ice and promote healing br br a horrible tragedy strikes a montana family they believe they've lost one son but it turns out they've lost 2 the key is if they just communicate and face their grief together they won't end up losing their second son permanently br br but they just can't something is blocking this family from sharing their sorrows some family retreat into silence and resentment while certain others point fingers of blame and then go ahead and cheat on their poor pregnant wife by seducing the pretty girlfriend of the deceased that andy character truly is a snake the only member of the family that isn't threatening arnold in some way is his grandpa wilford brimley grandpa seems to be able to speak to the boy without judgements or even kid gloves he seems to know what the child is thinking about even though arnold isn't saying much these days it is truly a blessing for the poor kid to have that one someone he can turn to no one else seems to grasp the fact that arnold might be in shock in denial or that his way of grieving may not be the same style or at the same speed as they would expect it's so easy to judge and to be angry and to feel someone is made of stone just because they don't grieve in a way we believe they ought br br the story is very quiet and naturalistic you're not going to get some spoon fed narration or some hollywood feel good resolution i was very concerned by the fact that this child was so burdened with guilt that he felt it necessary to hitchhike several hundred miles to apologize to that piggy andy's wife for something he should not blame himself for arnold may have accidentally killed his brother but nobody is responsible for the end of that marriage which apparently was a lousy one anyway except for the two people in the marriage it's only dumb luck arnold didn't get into the car with a pedophile or a murderer br br robert duvall and glenn close are frustratingly effective as the parents who somehow cannot find it in themselves to communicate with their son to find out what arnold is going through jason presson whom i've not seen anywhere else except for a childhood favorite called explorers and a creepy ghost story called the lady in white did an incredible job as arnold a great performance from a child actor br br aside from being somewhat slow at times the stone boy is an excellent and very depressing movie
we all create our own reality or do we that is the core question behind this highly original and masterfully crafted examination of the illusionary nature of reality blending eastern and buddhist philosophies with the visual chicanery of m c escher this fascinating treatise manages to take on the rather cerebral question of who are we and what is our place in the universe ' and turn it into a captivating and fun filled 100 minutes the film centers on bart a writer struggling with his screenplay the sea that thinks ' as he sits at his computer the work begins to unfold as nothing more than a description of his sitting at the computer writing the screenplay before long he is stuck in a whirling conundrum in which everything he writes becomes reality director gert de graaff approaches his subject with an impish sense of humor and dazzles the viewer with a series of astounding visual tricks that confront the nature and validity of our perception ultimately de graaff's film challenges the audience at several levels to question whether anything we see or touch or taste is really what it appears to be or whether our entire understanding of the universe and our place in it is merely a trick played on us by our senses note after you've seen the movie check out the film's entertaining web site dutch with english subtitles eric moore
while browsing the internet for previous sale prices i ran across these comments why are they all so serious it's just a movie and it's not pornographic i acquired this short film from my parents 30 years ago and have always been totally delighted with it i've shown it to many of my friends they all loved it too i feel privileged to own this original 1932 8mm black and white silent film of shirley before she became popular or well known after reading the other comments i agree that the film is racy big deal i only wish it was longer it seems that i must be the only person who owns one of these originals for sale at least so i wonder how much it's worth
hurrah a space film that doesn't take itself too seriously and everyone can come along for the exciting ride that is space camp the film starts slowly the usual mix of idiots and high fliers mixed together into a dodgy soup but when the going gets tough the tough get themselves sorted out and it's not an un believable change in the characters as you can believe that there's some responsibility in their young minds br br the only flaw in the film is that kate capshaw is extremely annoying as the i'm right and you're all wrong instructor i would recommend this as a nice night in movie and a 7 vote
the fluttering of butterfly wings in the atlantic can unleash a hurricane in the pacific according to this theory somehow related to the chaos theory i'm not sure exactly how every action no matter how small or insignificant will start a chain reaction that can lead to big events this small jewel of a film shows us a series of seemingly unrelated characters most of them in paris whose actions will affect each others' lives the six degrees of separation theory can be applied as well each story is a facet of the jewel that is this film the acting is finely tuned and nuanced audrey tautou is luminous the stories mesh plausibly the humor is just right and the viewer leaves the theatre nodding in agreement
at least i was able to enjoy mocking the movie which is surprising since i was barely able to sit through it in all honesty my guess is the cover to the dvd case cost more than the entire movie and saying that it is the same director as the boogeyman when a new version of that just came out nice touch guys it was misleading enough to rope me in the only thing that frustrated me more than the insufferable acting of the copycat was his haircut usually you only see that kind of hair on a ten year old boy and the character acted like it the film looks like it was shot by a d grad student of some film school excited to use every film technique he ever learned while attending classes sometimes less is more buddy through out i would get lost by random plot twists that led nowhere or were unexplained all this makes a bad movie but when the ending doesn't even come close to pulling it together well that makes it an exceptionally bad movie without a doubt this is the worst movie i have ever seen and that includes my friends' french final video for senior year of high school but hey maybe i'm a bit biased i mean i did get to play an extra p s i don't even think this deserves a star not even a half none for you
if you want mindless action hot chicks and a post apocalyptic view of seattle then this is the show for you br br the concept of dark angel isn't anything new in fact there's controversy over whether james cameron stole the idea from a book but i spend the entire hour watching it every tuesday from start to finish br br jessica alba is smoking and max' friends original cindy kendra are just as hot br br the fight scenes are getting better but the dialogues between original cindy and max need to be a little bit better the slang sounds forced and it sounds like someone living in the suburbs wrote it br br in my opinion dark angel is a great guilty pleasure filled with everything an action fan could ask for but if you're looking for hard hitting award winning drama go watch the west wing or something

no didn't think so well in that case all you have to do is stay far far away from do you wanna know a secret as it's just the umpteenth pointless post scream slasher with absolutely no redeeming value whatsoever the plot is extremely ridiculous the characters are insufferably dumb the gore factor is negligible and the whole thing is just plain boring as you can derive from the title already this film is mainly inspired by i still know what you did last summer as the events take place in a similar setting and the killer's motivations are equally stupid why anyone would want to steal ideas from junk like ikwydls is a complete mystery to me anyway at least that film could depend on the precious rack of jennifer love hewitt whereas the girls in this junk are apart from brainless also terribly unattractive one year after the still unsolved murder of her boyfriend beth morgan her new adulterous lover and four other simple minded college students go to florida to spend their spring break holiday in a fancy beach house the killer hasn't made a move all year but now he follows the posse to florida and starts butchering them whilst leaving behind the titular message as some sort of business card you really don't need to be a horror expert in order to quickly figure out which face hides behind the unspeakably ridiculous mask and the writers' attempts to put you on the wrong track are downright embarrassing since the plot is so thin most of the film is purely irrelevant padding including the sub plots regarding the incompetent floridian police force and the 'mysterious' fbi inspector who seems to have a personal score to settle the murder inexplicably happen off screen don't you hate it when that happens there isn't even any gratuitous t a to enjoy and you better don't get me started on the quality of the dialogs suffering through crap like this only makes you realize that the delightful spirit of the 80's slashers is gone for good
please do not let the cover of this movie fool you and if you're looking for a cheap horror movie to laugh at this isn't it usually i will go for stupid if it's funny but this stupid was so stupid it almost or possibly did make me stupid br br the film quality is better than a handheld but not by much and it's quite possible the music was created by pressing the samba 2 key on a casio keyboard these problems should never really be a deterent from seeing a horror movie but add this amazing weep cast and you have a real humdinger br br the story is about a guy who invites his friends up to his family cabin in texas for the weekend he also extends the invitation to his lady crush in his office on the way there they meet a female in distress who is then invited to come along by the other girls br br the stay at the cabin includes sex and nudity and soon everyone's panties are in a bunch when one girl disappears and odd items turn up in the house br br from there you the audience and the morons um actors try to figure out what's going on and they soon begin to distrust one another overall i think i have made it sound better than it is the main struggle with this movie is that the characters are very underdeveloped the plot contrived the acting bad and the motivations clueless once more this could be forgiveable it it was the least bit funny but alas it is not br br the twist ending is only a twist in that no one would guess it simply because if you really thought back through the movie it would not have made sense anyway please don't let this review stop you from seeing the shear wonderment of this movie woah my nose just grew eight inches
i found this movie quite by accident but am happy that i did kenneth branagh's performance came close to stealing this movie from helena bonham carter but their strong chemistry together made for a much more enjoyable movie this movie brought to mind the excellent movies that branagh made with emma thompson carter's star turn here as a disabled young women seeking to complete herself was as good a performance as i have seen from a female lead in a long time portraying a disabled person is hard to pull off but with basically only her eyes to show her pain about her situation in life she made it so believable if this movie had come out after the current wave of movies with beautiful women uglying themselves up for roles charlize theron halle berry i fell sure carter would have had strong consideration for an oscar if you run across this movie on cable late at night as i did trust me it is worth the lost sleep
in our household like everyone else who has commented on this movie my brothers 7 4 years old at the time and i 10 would watch this movie over and over again we all loved star wars but we always went back to this one because of the great songs and the adventure we all loved the camel and would sing at the top of our lungs with him during his song there are some slow moments the time spent with king koo koo in his court and we generally got bored after the knight's song the reason that i sound effect is because i loooooove you but we loved the journey to rescue babbette and the ending and were all a little freaked out by the picture of king koo koo floating there dominating the entire horizon laughing maniacally at the end i still to this day sing hooray for me babbette of gay paris around my friends i'm 33 now who just look at me as if i've lost my mind however when i'm singing it i'm 10 years old again remembering the wonderful year of star wars
ronald colman plays a famous broadway actor who has begun to lose his mind and sense of identity after years of playing a wide range of parts he can't remember who he exactly is who are his roles and who is the self and much more serious he begins to see and hear his play even in regular everyday life so since he's currently playing in othello he begins to act jealous and suspicious just like the title character ultimately it leads him to the depths of insanity and murder br br i saw this film years ago and liked it i just saw it again and loved it now perhaps some of my enthusiasm is because i have always liked ronald colman and this is a great triumph for him and for which he earned the best actor oscar and looking at the competition that year gregory peck for gentleman's agreement john garfield for body and soul william powell for life with father and michael redgrave for mourning becomes electra i think colman was a very good choice as he stretched from his usual comfort zone and did a much more demanding role br br now i noticed that one reviewer hated this film because they hated shakespeare and this took up about half their review talking about their dislike for him however this film isn't really about shakespeare and it doesn't matter at all if you dislike shakespeare i am no huge fan of shakespeare but marveled at the small portions of the play that colman re enacted though as i said this is not a really movie about shakespeare instead it's a wonderful portrait of an actor losing his mind and mixing his stage role with reality it could have been any play though othello was an excellent choice because of the murder scene which gets acted out for real later in the film br br overall a very clever film due to a lovely script with some overtones of film noir fortunately the acting was terrific also as colman had excellent support from signe hasso shelly winters and edmond o'brien who was particularly good he played his part just right and considering the great george cukor was directing it's no wonder it's a wonderful film from start to finish
it really is that bad of a movie my buddy rented it because he well is an idiot but then again i must be an idiot too because i watched the whole damn thing the actors were on par with high school drama geeks who think that are going places the only place they will be going is back to waiting tables at luby's all i could think of while i was watching this gem was how it actually got made i mean some screenwriter actually thought that this premise was fresh original and lucrative then some moron with money believed in the script so much that he decided to fork some cash over with the naive misconception that he was going to make a return on it actors were cast locations were scouted make up artists were hired computer animators fresh out of al collins graphic design school were brought in and this turd started to take form br br there obviously were a ton of things that i hated about this move but the one thing the drove me the craziest was the overuse of music every single minute of this flick was scored there was not a single break in music and at times it was mixed higher than the dialogue not that it made you miss some vital plot point or anything br br after it was over we decided to watch mystic river it was like driving a 1980 vw diesel rabbit then switching to a bmw 740il you couldn't get two more opposite movies in terms of quality
a very enjoyable film that features characters who do bad things and who let emotions like anger and a desire for vengeance bubble over the cast is very good there's plenty of action and stewart gets the girl and his revenge with a twist in the end i've seen this film several times and always watch when it's on amc or cable highly recommended
when i saw that imdb users rated this movie the bottom 250 movies i thought it was too harsh but little did i know that the low rating was absolutely correct br br i am a big fan of the wayans brothers i loved their scary movie 2 and even enjoyed white chicks little man however had very few laughs and the jokes were stale br br obviously the joke will revolve around marlon wayans who plays a grown midget that was recently let out of prison he and his partner tracy morgan steal a diamond meant for a gangster things go awry and the midget has to place the diamond with an unsuspecting couple played by shawn wayans and kerry washington in order to get the diamond back the midget pretends to be an abandoned baby left on the unsuspecting couples doorstep of course he is taken in and the drama begins on quest for the diamond br br the movie has some actors and actresses from saturday night live like molly shannon and rob schneider as well from in living colour all these talents however cannot help the poor script and the jokes which simply was not funny br br the special effects to make marlon wayans to look like a midget was ok i mean it was not 100 believable but it was ok nothing great i just wish that the wayans brothers had put more effort into developing a script with good jokes rather than trying to shore up their poor script with cameos from their famous comedic actors and actresses br br wait for it on cable or television it really is not worth any amount of money
this is an embarrassment to everyone and everything used in making this joke i personally don't care one way or another about jessica simpson and her talent or whatever so many people find fascinating about her just as a movie this is something that wouldn't even get a passing grade in film school the script is a mess the acting is atrocious and the fact luke wilson co writer of bottle rocket did this makes me wonder what the hell he was thinking he did old school for crying out loud this doesn't even belong in the same state as my old school dvd please for whatever reason do not watch this i see there is a comment that this is so bad it's good but that frankly is too kind when will we stop seeing singers that obviously can't act keep trying to i hope ends soon the worst part is that there are actually some decent actors penelope ann miller rachel leigh cook luke wilson who are part of this dump as far as the plot well it is almost non existent and so poorly done and written yes i know it's another rehash i very much doubt anyone will remember anything about this please whatever you do don't waste your time but if you do feel sorry for the actual actors involved for wasting their time doing this bomb jessica simpson you're pretty but stick to singing although i'm not much a fan of that either and whoever did this film i wouldn't put this on your resume 1 10 because you can't give a zero
there's never a dull moment in this movie wonderful visuals good actors and a classical story of the fight of good and evil mostly very funny sometimes even scary a true classic a movie everybody should see
first nobody can understand why this movie is rated so poorly not only is this the first real horrific movie since a very long time for me who am pretty hard boiled with a decades long experience of horror starting with driving through dark rides ghost trains as a child second the main actress cheri christian has a face that lets you hope she will be the leading actress in major pictures of the future third this woman is that tremendously beautiful that i suggest the directors retire all those cameron diazes eva mendezes and how ever the names of these ephemeral bulb lights are mrs christian is not a light but a sun br br however dark remains is also of considerable metaphysical importance they idea that photographs shows creatures of the intermediary reign between reality and imagination that are not visible with one' own eyes is not new but i have never seen in a movie before that those creatures are visible on the photographs only for certain people and only to certain times this means that the photo is not just an iconic picture of reality by which reality turns into a sign but becomes an alternative form of reality which can change as the real reality can being a sign the changing of the picture means that it influences the photographed objects i e the sign behaves like an object now in our usual world of perception it is common that objects change signs f ex if someone grows a bird his photograph will show him with beard not without as it did before but the opposite the changing of objects by signs would imply that the photo with beard is first and only then the beard grows on the man this is very simply expressed the case that happen with the photos taken by the main character in the prison in this movie this is new and we must be thankful for everything new in horror movies which usually just repeat and reorder effects and features that are already well known mostly since the silent time
if you want to see a mystery don't watch this though there are elements straight out of elmore leonard territory this comes closer to an episode of dynasty since the filmmaker focuses on character development i e long boring talks between stupid un involving characters some people can make fascinating movies without real action see exotica but not this one avoid it especially if you like the actors involved in this one
it is amazing to me what passes for entertainment today maybe i am a dinosaur from the fifties and i am out of touch with todays movie going generation and apparently that is the case with regards to this movie since so many people loved it i found it foul and vulgar i haven't said that about many movies in my life but this one fits the bill the humor is sophomoric and crude i am not a politically correct person and even i found the gay jokes not only not funny but downright offensive i'm not gay the main character in the movie is not even a likable person just pathetic when the movie was finally over i heard a number of people comment on how disappointed they were in what they had just pay good money to see
what made the original killer tomatoes fun was it was made by people with no budget who were just being wacky for a couple of days br br this was something with a budget but it just wasn't as much fun john astin of adams family fame is actually making an effort here to be comedic but he is supported by lame actors cheap special effects and unfunny gags br br the plot dr gangrene astin escapes from a french prison and decides he is going to put a pretender on the throne of france the hero his french girlfriend and the gizmo like fuzzy tomato decide they are going to stop him br br forgettable direct to video nonsense
what percentage of movies does a person go to see these days that leave them wondering what happened to their eight to ten dollars answer too many this movie isn't like that it is a story about real people that are sometimes a combination of both likable and unlikable br br downside br br not enough character development some plot lines left twisting in the wind br br upside br br forces viewers to think about the choices they have made for good or bad in their own lives br br well acted by scott cohen judd hirsch susan floyd ato essandoh and elliot korte br br contains some good lighthearted humor
first some background i am english and have lived in london all my life i have been to many games at 'the den' and most other london club grounds i am familiar with the type of person who gets into hooliganism and i know just how they act and how they speak have to say this is a bad bad movie i can tell you that green street is one of the most unrealistic movies i have ever seen i spent most of the movie cringing with embarrassment i felt i should write a mini review because i felt i needed to point out a few things br br a people just don't talk like that in london in real life the filmmakers took the whole slang thing too far and made it sound stupid unfortunately hooligan types do exist but those you see in green street are more like parodies b the actor who plays pete dunham charlie hunnam unfortunately sounded about as 'english' or 'cockney' as osama bin laden he's from up north in newcastle and i'm just amazed any of the other actors could keep straight face acting alongside him how are we supposed to take him seriously why they didn't just get someone from east london to play that part is beyond me i could have done 'a bang up job' myself hehe c mr frodo i mean how can i be expected to take seriously elijah wood kicking the ass of people twice his size and who are genuinely nasty hooligans he'd be dead simple as that honestly as a brit it was hard to watch this film i'm pretty sure this film will bomb here in the uk it may do a little better in the states because the americans just wont know or care how inaccurate it is br br please my american and foreign friends don't believe a word of this nonsense yes these firms do exist but it's all extremely underground and hush hush and on a vastly smaller scale the movie only gets a 2 from me because they actually filmed some of it in london usually they try to film these things in cardiff wales or something and expect us all not to notice
a must see movie for anyone who ever went to camp or wanted to this film captures the absolute essence of what summer camp is all about it is funny it is compassionate it makes you want to watch more about the characters once the credits begin to role if you have not seen this movie what are you doing get off you butt and run the video store have a great summer

i used to have a fascination with the cartoon back in college when it was being made it had much the charm of get smart while it admittedly had its faults it was rather enjoyable br br naturally i was very interested in seeing the film version that was before i saw it afterwords i wished it had never been made br br besides being miscast all around who on earth though broderick was even close to the role it just didn't make the grade br br the effects were reasonable and perhaps the only thing i liked about the movie seeing a live action version of the gadgets in action what was missing was a story and treatment which made it funny or charming or interesting br br the original was a wacky cartoon with a very lighthearted attitude it was fun the motion picture became murky and took itself far too seriously if it had seriously had a great plot or went crazy enough to make it seem like a cartoon on film it might have been enjoyable br br as it exists it doesn't deserve to be considered part of the gadget legacy
one night i was waiting for my friends to come back to the apt and gymkata happened to be on i watched way too much of it it is indeed hilarious and horrifying really think about it this way if in your job you had an idea for something this bad and went on to execute it in as terrible a fashion as this how long exactly would you last not as long as this movie it's a must see obviously
the title should have been the walker the guy expend 90 of the movie walking he doesn't know what he wants or what he is go through life stealing peoples identity for nothing he gets no benefit no money nothing pretending to be another person br br no body was able to understand why he was pretending to be somebody else br br the only thing that was clear in this movie is that he love his father and was a good son but the rest was crap br br may be director is a looser that would like to be somebody else but what he really should do is to get a real job because after his movie i don't think he has a chance to make as a movie producer
this film along with westfront 1918 are my favorite pabst directed films and i enjoyed them more than his much more famous films which starred louise brooks such as pandora's box it's probably because both are very similar to the neo realist films that the italians perfected in the 1940s and 50s this style film called for using non actors just typical folks in everyday settings in order to create intensely involving and realistic films br br in this case the film is about french and german coal miners so appropriately the people in the roles seem like miners not actors the central conflict as the film begins is that there is a huge mine located on the franco german border instead of one big mine it is divided at the border and german workers are not welcome in the french mine despite there being greater unemployment in germany this language differences illustrated wonderfully in a dance hall scene and wwi conspire to create a huge rift between the factions resulting in a we vs they mentality later an explosion causes a huge collapse in the french and the germans refuse to sit back and do nothing risking their own lives they prove that there is true comradeship between miners and men in general br br the film is a strong criticism of xenophobia and tried in vain to get the german audiences to see the futility of war and hatred it was a gorgeously moving film with some of the scariest and claustrophobic images i have ever seen considering history though the film's impact was minimal at best it's a real shame as like this one westfront 1918 jÁaccuse gance and all quiet on the western front milestone had great messages of peace and harmony but ultimately were failures in positively swaying public opinion so from a historical point of view it's an amazing and sad relic that is well worth seeing
this must me one of the worst takes on vampires ever conceived by men how can one turn such a mesmerizing subject into a totally uninspiring story apparantly not such a difficult task first of all a conditio sine qua non of any vampirefilm is a dark and gloomy atmosphere with a nice sexy touch this one lacks all these things too much light the spots oh my god why in the name of christ judas was that about br br every time dracula came about he was devoured by light in the script to keep him weak for the record just weak there was only one scene that made it almost worth watching near the ending of the movie beatiful dancingscene with dracula and his new conquest i really enjoyed the first one the judas twist was defintely original but this one's just not good not in any way hopefully the third one will cary the vampire signature i like so much in other classics like herzog's nosferatu coppola's dracula or even interview with the vampire
soldier blue is a movie with pretensions pretensions to be some sort of profound statement on man's inhumanity to man on the white man's exploitation of and brutality towards indigenous peoples a biting unflinching and sardonic commentary on the horrors of vietnam well sorry but it fails miserably to be any of those things what soldier blue actually is is pernicious trite badly made dishonest rubbish br br another reviewer here hit the nail on the head in saying that it appears to be a hybrid of two entirely different movies what it is basically is a lame clichéd poorly acted odd couple romance strauss and bergen overcoming their prejudices about the other's lifestyle and falling in love ah bless bookended by two sickening massacres which wouldn't have been out of place in a lucio fulci splatter flick br br there is no excuse for the repulsive prurient gore drenched climax in which cute little native american children are variously shot sliced dismembered and impaled in loving and graphic close up and large breasted native american women are molested raped and strung up no excuse that is except box office the massacre itself whilst repulsive in its misplaced intention is very badly staged and shot a bunch of actors lying around with bright red paint smeared on them intercut with a few special effects sequences of beheading dismemberment dismemberments incidentally which utilised real amputees in their filming now that's what i call exploitation br br forget all the pap you've heard including the ludicrous commentaries that begin and end the movie about this being a protest an indictment of american brutality towards the native peoples this film doesn't give a stuff about the plight of the cheyenne had it done so it would have featured some involving native american characters would have led us to get to know and to care about the nameless faceless innocents who get slaughtered at the climax instead what we get is the silly white bread romance of bergen and strauss lousy actors both in this at least with plenty of blood guts and severed heads thrown in to attract the curious br br which is a terrible shame because there is a movie to be made about the sand creek massacre about all of the real life massacres the us and britain and all so called civilised nations have participated in over the centuries iraq this just isn't that movie
billy crystal normally brings the crowd to laughter but in this movie he and all the rest of them cannot bring any smile on my face or perhaps just one they call it comedy i say it's a waste of my time
this low budget erotic thriller that has some good points but a lot more bad one the plot revolves around a female lawyer trying to clear her lover who is accused of murdering his wife being a soft core film that entails her going undercover at a strip club and having sex with possible suspects as plots go for this type of genre not to bad the script is okay and the story makes enough sense for someone up at 2 am watching this not to notice too many plot holes but everything else in the film seems cheap the lead actors aren't that bad but pretty much all the supporting ones are unbelievably bad one girl seems like she is drunk and or high the cinematography is badly lit with everything looking grainy and ugly the sound is so terrible that you can barely hear what people are saying the worst thing in this movie is the reason you're watching it the sex the reason people watch these things is for hot sex scenes featuring really hot girls in red shoe diary situations the sex scenes aren't hot they're sleazy shot in that porno style where everything is just a master shot of two people going at it the woman also look like they are refuges from a porn shoot i'm not trying to be rude or mean here but they all have that breast implants and a burned out weathered look even the title deviant obsession sounds like a hardcore flick not that i don't have anything against porn in fact i love it but i want my soft core and my hard core separate what ever happened to actresses like shannon tweed jacqueline lovell shannon whirry and kim dawson women that could act and who would totally arouse you and what happened to b erotic thrillers like body chemistry nighteyes and even stripped to kill sure none of these where masterpieces but at least they felt like movies plus they were pushing the envelope going beyond hollywood's relatively prude stance on sex sexual obsessions and perversions now they just make hard core films without the hard core sex
spoilers when undercover brooklyn north det eddie santos nestor serrano was to meet his drug supplier tito zapatti larry romano in the williamsburg section of brooklyn in a buy and bust operation with tito being the one who gets busted that things went haywire with both det santos and tito ending up getting shot and killed by each other during the deadly shootout an innocent bystander six year old james bone jr jaliyl lynn was also killed in the cross fire br br with new york city slated to host the 1996 democratic presidential convention that summer that last thing that the city's flamboyant mayor pappas al pacino wanted was a possible riot over young james bones tragic death by a possible in was later determined that it was a bullet from tito's gun that killed young james member of the new york city police department br br what was far more shocking then even bone's death is that his killer tito zapatti was given probation by the well respected ny state judge walter stern martin landau when he should have been put behind bars for 10 to 20 years by being arrested with a kilo of cocaine in the backseat of his car it soon became evident that the person who got judge stern his job for a 50 000 00 payoff was non other the brooklyn political boss frank anselmo danny aiello it's anselmo who's involved with mayor pappas in a land deal involving the new york subway system that would bring him and his real estate friends tens of millions of dollars over the next two years it would also indirectly connect mayor pappas in the bone killing by connecting him to judge stern who made it possible for tito be be free who's a mutual friend of both him and his gomba or landsman frank anselmo br br to keep all this from blowing up the late det santons is framed by working undercover without the authority from his superiors in the bone shooting in fact those framing santos go as far and hiding some 40 000 00 in cash in his upstate summer home making it look like he was being paid off by tito's uncle mafia boss paul zapatti anthony francoisa for letting his nephew deal drugs with him getting a piece of the action which may well explain him as well as tito getting shot by tito welshing on his paying santos off br br as things turn out it's mayor pappas' deputy in city hall kevin calhoun john cusack who ends up messing everything up for his boss by being too honest in finding who was responsible in covering up tito's criminal record that allowed him to be out on the streets the facts that kevin uncovered lead straight to frank anselmo a major political supporter of mayor pappas who as it turned out was connected by the hip to tito's mafia chieftain uncle paul br br a bit over plotted city hall does show how big city corruption can filter up as well as down to everyone in city government without them like mayor pappas even knowing about it mayor pappas biggest sin was that he was friends with brooklyn boss anselmo who was putting people into jobs like judge stern who were subjected to being blackmailed from anselmo's real boss mafioso paul zapatti br br spoilers it only took a deadly shootout in williamsburg to set everything into motion not by only tito besides det santos and james bone being killed but why he was allowed to be out on the street in order to bring the very popular new york city mayor down mayor pappas was looking forward to much bigger things like governor or even president in his future political pursuits as it turned out his top deputy kevin calhoun in not looking the other way was responsible for his demise as well as that of the mayor's good friend frank anselmo and the person whom he helped put on the bench as a state judge judge stern who's decision in letting tito zapatti off made this whole disaster which resulted in at least a half dozen murders and one suicide possible
i didn't even bother finishing the movie because i was so bored i thought i was going to pass out i was watching it in the movie theaters and me and my friends just got tired so we got up and left to another movie if i ever have to sit through 2 min of that movie again i think i'm going to shoot myself and i do know the whole entire movie because my friend told me what happened at the end and i wasn't surprised at all i mean who didn't know she was going to do the right thing and let him be happy i mean for real you would have to be a complete idiot not to know that i know i didn't miss anything and if somebody ask's me to see that movie i would say over my dead body
in a word this film was boring it lacked life and spark a big problem is with the two leads jude law and gwyneth paltrow had no chemistry whatsoever he was boring and she was annoying br br the visuals were interesting but they didn't enhance the scenes if anything the visuals tended to detach the audience from what was happening on screen none of the action sequences felt real and hence the film failed to create any real drama or a sense of danger br br the film had potential but it needed a better script better acting and a better director i kept thinking during the film you know this movie would've worked if harrison ford was sky captain karen allen was polly and steven spielberg was the director br br ignore the critical acclaims for this film the critics i think are praising the film because they want to like it and want it to succeed even though it fails on so many different levels
i bought this movie and after i watched it i decided that i did not care for it the acting was bad was the principal a robot he had no personality and his facial expression didn't change through the whole movie at times the voices didn't match up people talking and their lips didn't even move
spoiler alert personally i don't understand why pete did not help to save williams life i mean that would be great to know why william was motivated or forced i think secret service members are every day people and there is a rumor the writer was a member of the secret service now he's motivations are clear well known but as a rental this film will not satisfy you cause the old but used twists the average acting these are just things in this film only for keep you wait the end clark johnson as the director of s w a t did a far better work like this time and i still wondering how the producers for example michael douglas left this film to theaters
i've now just realised that by watching this film i have lost valuable precious moments of my life i will never get back thsi film isn't just poor its dire it reminded me of every stereotypical black sitcom ever made br br i regret watching this film br br flixmedia reckons its a race issue apparently white people don't like it because it doesn't have white actors mate i think you'll find the reason why no one liked this was because watching paint dry is far more entertaining and funnier then this pile of drivel br br please stop making crap films
a friend of mine recommended this movie citing my vocal and inflective similarities with des howl the movie's main character i guess to an extent i can see that and perhaps a bit more i'm not very sure whether or not that's flattering portrayal br br this is a pretty unique work the only movie to which this might have more than a glancing similarity would be true romance not for the content or the style of filming or for the pace of dialogue whale music is just so much more well relaxed but instead that they both represent modern love stories br br in general i'm a big fan of canadian movies about music and musicians for example i highly recommend hard core logo and this film in particular it has an innocent charm des is not always the most likeably guy but there's something about him that draws a sterling sort of empathy
this is the first review i've wrote for imdb so bare with me but i caught this flick on hbo and was sure glad i watched it richard gere is great in this film as the passionate agent detective who bends the rules to get the job done i think the story is great and there's never a dull scene that slows the pace of the movie down some parts of the movie which have to do with demented sex addicts are pretty shocking but if you've ever seen a crime film like se7en you'll be able to stomach the scenes just fine br br so all in all if you're looking for a good detective suspense movie ignore the low rating this movie got on imdb and definitely watch it
i can't say this is the worst film of all time but only because there are still some movies i haven't seen yet this has to be the most pretentious attempt at making a movie of all time the director suffers from the same issues he had with there will be blood though he wasn't quite as bad in that film the whole movie it feels like you're watching a guy trying to hard to impress beyond his abilities it's like he sits in his little director's chair and thinks how would a great filmmaker handle this scene he just doesn't have it in him i don't know if this film could be saved by a great filmmaker there were certainly some nuggets of greatness that could have been polished but nothing was brought to ripen the scene where all the characters are singing was the worst moment in cinema history one by one as we see the characters singing and i squirmed in my seat i kept saying please please just don't have the guy on the brink of death singing too sure enough massive failure
i've seen better teenage werewolf movies in my time this one however takes the cake more comedy than horror full moon high puts the c in cheese fest the star quality in this movie is not bad just the way it was made just sends in rolling downhill adam arkin plays tony an all american high school football player of the 50's who ends up not aging due to a werewolf bite in transylvania the most annoying part of the movie was the violin player he drove everyone batty ed mcmahon plays his ultra conservative father who met his end of his own bullet adam's father alan plays a shrink who seems to be not top of his game after all these years tony seems to be very out of place due to the attack and then he'll get the chance to catch in his state more laugh than blood shed this movie is just a start in the 80's teen wolf was an improvement from this 1 out of 5 stars
this movie was excellent a bit scary but excellent at that for those of you that have heard of columbine and know the story it gives you a idea of what and why these kids did what they did in the back of your mind you know that people think of this stuff but you never realize just how bad it is and this movie makes you realize it's seriously that good it also makes you think twice before you make fun of someone that's for sure i read a book on the columbine massacre and it made me think this movie makes me worry and scares me to death on the downside it's like a how to kill someone guide for serial killers i recently received a threat and i blew it off thinking nothing of it but after this movie i think you should take everything seriously some people are crazy and you never truly know which they are so take it seriously and don't under estimate someone
feeding the masses is just one of many recent mediocre zombie movies to be after your hard earned dollars suggestion keep your hard earned dollars and let's just say that good old theatrex took one for the team on this one guess what the plots about zombies taking over this time though for the sake of originality this film takes place in rhode island and to be honest i'm not sure i've ever seen a zombie flick based in rhode island a tv station controlled by the government is supposedly keeping up normal broadcasts so that any remaining citizens won't think that there's any problem in the world that is those that never look or go outside anyway i will say though that a few of the commercials broadcast by this station were probably the most amusing part of this film there is actually somewhat of a story to this but i'm not bothering with that because after a while you'll either not care or have fallen asleep at any rate this has plenty of terrible acting to throw on top off all the seen it all before stuff that gets trotted out before the camera trust me you can find plenty of other things to do with your time than watch this 3 out of 10
this was a real guilt pleasure i saw the trailer and all the advertising so i figured 'why not check out this vh1 movie ' and as they used to say on t v 'i can't believe i watched the whole thing ' quinn and harris were believable beatle boys and although the accents were sort of over the top and difficult to decipher at times i found the dialogue believable as well the film touched upon the tenuous relationship of len mc and showed how deep down they were simply two guys who grew up close together and shared a passion for music coming at it though with different sets of issues and personal needs you find yourself wishing they'd hopped in the cab to snl for an impromptu reunion that would have knocked the world's socks off but you also gain a greater appreciation for why they didn't
not only does this movie have a poor plot bad direction and terrible acting its opens up a whole new meaning to racism br br in this film white chicks are the sluts white boys are the wana be gangsters and successful yes again white businessmen are revolting toilet shitters br br i just wonder what would happen if i made the exact same movie with the exact same story line and script only i made it about caucasians he dude its good to finally see your've stopped dating those black chicks br br nobody seems to notice it but watch this film again and you'll vomit at how they have portrayed the new zealand white boys all of a sudden its white folks who are the main cause of gang aggression and whores out for a quick bang only samoans girls have a heart there's no such thing as a non slutty white girl br br it disgusts me that they couldn't make this film without giving the caucasian community in new zealand a repulsive profile if you think i'm overgeneralizing go watch this film and see what you make of the white boys just because samoans choose to call us white boys in actual life doesn't mean its funny if i said hey black boy i'll loose my teeth br br don't see this movie don't waste your money don't be racist
i am an avid fan of violent exploitation cinema who would never attack a film for being violent or disturbing i consider cannibal holocaust a masterpiece and will always defend controversial films like day of the woman or last house on the left as genuine classics anyone who browses through my other user comments will notice that i am actually very pro violence gore when it comes to films however i do think that there should be at least some point to the violence this piece of crap doesn't have any point whatsoever the first film in the notorious guinea pig series the devil's experiment 1985 is widely controversial but as opposed to many other controversial films this stinker has nothing at all to be recommended for i must say that before seeing any of the guniea pig films i already had a feeling that i would hate this one knowing what it was about due to its status as one of the most controversial films around however i decided i had to see it i am very glad i didn't waste any money on this pile of crap and i sure wish i hadn't wasted my time with it either br br this thing's story i don't even want to call it a 'film' it doesn't have one three scumbags torture a woman to death for some excruciating 40 minutes that's it there is no artistic value no 'shocking' story no suspense nothing simply the disbelief that a film that shows nothing except for a woman being tortured for no reason enjoys an enormous cult following it is disturbing i give it that of course it is disturbing to watch a torture video for 40 minutes what is more disturbing however is the fact that many people actually seem to regard this pile of garbage as some kind of masterpiece i really cannot figure why the fact that the gore effects look realistic cannot be the reason i hope the girl who plays the victim isn't a very good actor and reacts very calm to all the torture that makes the film look less realistic which is in this single case a good thing this is a film that is sickening not for its gore but for its redundancy its existence for the sole purpose of showing 40 minutes of torture br br i strongly oppose any form of censorship since this is 100 fake and nobody got hurt during its production it is legitimate to make such a film however i cannot think of a single reason why anyone would like this other than the morbid desire to watch suffering and the enjoyment of torture this film's sequel flowers of flesh and blood gained notoriety when actor charlie sheen mistook it for an actual snuff film and informed the fbi fortuneately the film turned out to be fake overall the devil's experiment is a fake torture snuff film that seems to have the sole purpose of looking as close to a real snuff film as possible br br the devil's experiment is one of the worst films i have ever had the misfortune of sitting through don't torture yourself by giving this piece of crap a try for its controversial status do yourself a favor and avoid it zero stars out of 10 i wish there was a negative scale in order to appropriately rate this pile of crap
having seen three other versions of the same film i am afraid for me this is by far the weakest primarily due to scott's rather dull and leaden performance his emotions throughout are so bland it makes it difficult to engage in the film alistair sim portrayed the role infinitely better when scrooge was at his meanest you don't get the sense scott is saying the dialogue with much conviction and when he undergoes his metamorphosis he is similarly unconvincing i cannot think of any actors in this film who match those from the alistair sim version even the musical version and frankly the muppets take on this are better executed very disappointing
i saw the the bourne ultimatum last summer with a friend and wow i had already seen the first two films and i liked them but ultimatum i loved br br matt damon plays jason bourne a amnesia suffering cia agent on the run trying to discover who he is br br like i already said i loved this movie from start to finish no plot holes slow scenes everything was paced just right and it fit in well with the other films but in all senses it was much better br br best stunts car chases actors and effects i've seen in an action movie all summer surprisingly due to spider man 3 pirates etc but i it wasn't just action in this film jason doesn't just kill and run he has a soul and the audience feels for him so drama is included but that doesn't slow it down br br of all the threequels that came out last summer this was the best
october sky is a highly lauded movie and it¡¦s easy to see why the story is easy to comprehend and many turning points are gripping the actors and actresses do fairly good jobs especially jake gyllenhaal and chris cooper the hero finally gets what he wants and it¡¦s a true story frankly i think the director¡¦s achievement is not comparable to the sparks and heat the original story generates we don¡¦t see any special narrative or cinematography the power of the movie relies much on the riveting plot and tough situation the young hero is trapped in that most audience will find themselves identify with the characters we feel homer¡¦s desire to earn his father¡¦s recognition and create his own future and his resilience wins our respect ¡§october sky¡¨ reminds me of a later 2001 japanese production of mini series ¡§rocket boy ¡¨ which might owe some of the inspiration from this movie actually these two works shot from two different cultures provide interesting comparison when october sky unfolds a story of a young man crying out loud to claim his right over his own destiny ¡§rocket boy¡¨ offers a more compromised description that could sometimes constitute an acrid criticism of modern society starring the outstanding actor yuji oda ¡§rocket boy¡¨ focuses on three men as ordinary as can be a travel agent who has a dream of becoming an astronaut a boastful advertising agent who is on the brink of being torn apart by his inferiority complex resulted from the extreme success of his father and older brother like what homer feels in his family and a food company employee who is about to getting married but scared of this idea the collected social consciousness superimposes its definition of success on its constituents and steps further to force them suffocate their dreams by claiming them ¡§impossible ¡¨ to compensate for his lost ideal kobayashi yuji works in the tour operator because it¡¦s called ¡§galaxy ¡¨ when his client fails him and his girlfriend decides to leave him he finally finds strength from his father¡¦s words who had determined to be a sailor but later found life on the sea less attractive as he had presumed ¡§but i don¡¦t regret it ¡¨ his father told kobayashi ¡§at least i tried ¡¨ it is his father¡¦s confession that encourages him to resign his job and apply for astronautships despite the fact that he hurts his legs and needs to move around on a wheelchair kobayashi¡¦s effort finally fails and he goes back to the travel agency but his ¡§crazy¡¨ courage inspires his friends and everyone loves him more just before the end of the series kobayashi is on the job as a guide of a space camp meant to let children learn more about astronauts after the tour is over we see him leaning against a tree unfolding a sheet of poster he tears from the bulletin board that says ¡§astronauts wanted for 2004 ¡¨ kobayashi looks at the piece of paper and laughs and laughs just like a kid looking at his ticket to disneyland kobayashi may never get what he wants but he dares his destiny and ¡§just does it ¡¨ this series is so heart gripping not because the hero exhibits any heroic deeds but his ordinariness and unstoppable urge to realize his dream which make us wonder and envy unlike dilbert or other sarcastic writings this show enlightens us and teaches us something homer and kobayashi both have the dream and they do what they can despite other people¡¦s opinions i recommend other imdb users to see the japanese tv series if you are a nine to fiver you will feel more touched i feel sorry that imdb doesn¡¦t have its data maybe you can ask somebody from japan to help you
as a movie this barely rates a 4 but for movie fans of the 1940s period it's almost a must see and rates a 9 as a variety show i was drawn to watch this by the presence of richard captain midnight webb who plays the colonel in charge of the event what surprised me was the stunning performance of doris day outside of 'calamity jane' i've never seen her put over a song better than she does here randolph scott is memorable as well even if he doesn't see much screen time it's been a while since i saw the movie but i was almost sure humphrey bogart put in an appearance with so many familiar faces it's hard to keep track if it ever turns up on a tv station near you be sure to catch the doris day sequence if nothing else br br
i saw this on tv the other night or rather i flicked over to another channel every so often to watch infomercials when i couldn't stand watching it any longer it was bad really really bad not so bad it's good just flat out bad how did it get funded who thought this was a good idea an actor friend of mine auditioned and was told he wasn't good enough to play a bad guy but i think what they meant was save yourself and runaway from this steaming pile of i bet the rest of the cast had been given the option to be fair the acting was hard to judge because of the appalling fake american ascents the shooting was dullllllllllll the action was awkward and stilted the dialog was inane by far the saddest thing was ship in real life the interislander ferry is a shabby boat and on film it doesn't scrub up well instead of trying very unsuccessfully to make it look like a new crews liner with bits of tinsel wrapped around rusting polls i kid you not they could have change the script to explain or even celebrate the shabbiness dumb dumb dumb don't watch this movie not even as a joke
citizen x tells the story of the butcher of rostov nickname for a heinous and perverse russian serial killer who claimed 52 lives from 1978 92 the film focuses on the novice detective rea who doggedly pursued the killer against all odds in the face of an uncooperative bureaucracy in self serving and convenient denial an hbo product for t v the film offers a solid cast good performances spares the audience much of the grisly details but plays out like a docudrama sans the stylistics of similar hollywood fare an even and straight forward dramatization of a serious and comparatively little known story more interesting than jack the ripper b
fever pitch isn't a bad film it's a terrible film br br is it possible american movie audiences and critics are so numbed and lobotomized by the excrement that hollywood churns out that they'll praise to the skies even a mediocre film with barely any laughs that's the only reason i can think of why this horrible romantic comedy and i use that term loosely because there's nothing funny in this film is getting good reviews br br i sat through this film stunned that screenwriters lowell ganz and babaloo mandel would even for an instant think their script was funny br br the brilliant nick hornby usually translates well to film he adapted fever pitch for a british film starring colin firth and ruth gemmell in 1997 peter hedges found hornby's voice for about a boy 2002 and when high fidelity was americanized for a movie in 2000 writers d v devincentis steve pink john cusack and scott rosenberg didn't go wrong because they kept the essence of hornby's wit and humor they made one of the best films of that year br br so why does the american version of fever pitch go so painfully awry the british version wasn't a masterpiece but it was charming funny unexpected and gave us two characters we could like respect and understand br br but ganz and mandel have excised everything funny in hornby's work in americanizing the story they've butchered it removing all that was good and unique about hornby's work and replacing it with conventional drivel br br they've transformed a funny story into a formulaic romantic comedy never once veering from the wretched formula lindsey drew barrymore has three girlfriends each of whom has a distinct function one's overweight the second's cynical and ambitious and the third's a romantic want to guess how many male friends ben jimmy fallon has br br what made high fidelity such fun was not only a good leading man and lady but engaging supporting characters in this fever pitch the six supporting friends do or say nothing especially funny they're so insignificant they're not even decorative the only reason they're in the film is because the formula demands it poor ione skye winds up as one lindsey's pals in a thankless role the lovely skye must have been wishing lloyd dobler would swoop in and take her away come to think of it cusack would've made an excellent ben of course cusack is too smart to attach himself to such an utterly tedious script br br there isn't a single solitary moment in this film that seems original or unforced every plot turn is predictable every lame joke telegraphed ganz and mandel labor for laughs the first 45 minutes are so excruciatingly slow you wonder if these chaps realized they were writing a comedy you can mark the plot turns in this film by your watch it's almost as if ganz and mandel penned this with some screen writing guru's formula pasted on the wall when they got to a certain page they looked up at the formula and said ok the guru says this has to happen now and presto br br directors bobby and peter farrelly don't help the film any they have no concept how to introduce their story and characters they hand over the v o narration not to the protagonist but to another guy who sits behind ben at fenway park thanks to some extremely clunky writing we have to watch barrymore and fallon stumble through their unfunny initial meetings br br barrymore does cute and adorable better than most she's as good at it as goldie hawn in her heyday but even her cuteness can't save this extraordinarily awful film she tries hard to wring some energy and humor out of this story about 30 minutes into the film lindsey tells ben you're funny the only explanation for her remark is that it was in the script for fallon's ben never says anything even remotely funny fallon is neither witty nor funny when he does comedy he overacts br br fallon was never any good on saturday night live he was quite possibly the least funny person on that show remember that lame sketch about a radio dj who did all the voices the only reason weekend update worked occasionally was because fallon's cohort tina fey knows a thing or two about comedy br br actors who think they're funny and behave that way rarely if ever are actually funny that's true of fallon he thinks he's hysterically funny when he barely raises a chuckle his stuttering unsure of himself shtick didn't work on the small screen it's lousier on the big screen br br unfortunately for fallon his role in this picture also requires a few dramatic moments if you thought his comedy was bad wait till you get a load of his dramatic stuff two scenes in particular the first in a park the second in front of ben's school are painful to watch the scenes require an actor with a smidgen of dramatic ability but fallon has neither the knowledge nor the ability to make them work his range of emotions doesn't even run the gamut from a to b br br ben has no personality or depth often he comes across as an oaf and not a lovable one at that it boggles the mind what lindsey would find attractive about him compare fallon's performance to firth's in the british version and you'll understand how terribly flat unfunny and forced fallon's ben is and how wrong he is for this role watching fallon in fever pitch makes one long for the dramatic depth and comedic nuance of ashton kutcher br br just as high fidelity did an americanized fever pitch could've worked brilliantly it just needed better writers more competent directors and most definitely a stronger funnier smarter leading man do yourself a huge favor avoid this rotten film rent the 1997 british version and read hornby's book instead
the van is a simple teensploitation picture made especially for the drive in that goes out of it's way to make you feel comfortable providing many opportunities to laugh and cry with your friends danny devito has a small yet plentiful role as the manager of a car wash and almost steals the show all the leads are well acted the characters complex and the directing quite competent for this type of picture a crown international release
the movie has the longest most tortured and agonized ending of any movie i've seen in a long time unfortunately it starts right after the opening credits january jones gives such a wooden performance i was surprised she didn't go up in flames when she got near the candles in the film i don't really remember her from the other films she's done a blessing i have to believe i never criticize an actors performance because in film there are too many things which can affect it but in this case it is so bad that it actually stands out from the atrocious script granted she's given lines and situations meryl streep would have trouble with but i swear at times shes reading from a cue card off set at other times i thought she might actually be learning disabled or slow in some way for real the plot dialog and pacing are as bad as you'll ever see but there is still no excuse for this performance nor for the director that let it be perpetrated i feel sorry for the other actors cruel intentions 10 little indians breakfast club shoved into a rotten burrito then regurgitated by a grade school writer director take that back this has studio exec crayola all over it
seriously crappy movie br br first off the movie starts with a cop and his partner parked outside of a warehouse furniture store the bad cop takes a girl which they had pulled over into the warehouse's attic while the newbie cop sits outside and ponders what could be happening up there the bad cop eventually returns with a heavy duffel bag and the newbie cop doesn't think there are any problems but he still wonders what was in the bag so he asks gets a bullshit response and then he thinks everything is ok for now br br the bad cop repeats this process and even once with a tit scene made it slightly better but eventually people start to catch on which took awhile considering how f ing obvious it was one girl gets a voodoo curse placed on her just in case she dies like ya do now the bad cop eventually kills this magically protected bitch and then he gets rid of the duffel bagged body br br since she had the oogey boogey magic put on her she comes back with lots of eye shadow on which is supposed to indicate that she may be a zombie also the magic curse causes all of the other girls to become eye shadow monsters some of the girls meet up with a dude who is apparently a currency specialist and he offers them a ride they look normal to him apparently but when the girls see other people such as the one girls husband he freaks out because she is hideous some people freak out but others don't even notice massive plot hole br br so to wrap it up the eye shadow monsters kill the bad cop who in turn ends up becoming a zombie in the last scene it was as though they were trying to prep us for a sequel like anyone would want to see part 2 of this cow dropping
i really have problems rating this movie it is directed brilliantly there is obviously a lot of money in it gere and danes are intense although her screen personality could use a bit more defining and spicing up editing and cinematography are excellent on the other hand it is one of those really really sick movies where one cannot help but wonder whether the director himself likes to stage specific scenes and yes one cannot help but wonder how many copycats will such a movie inspire br br in purely artistic terms it is a 9 but i really have to ask myself who these people are giving their money to produce such a movie
this movie is another on the list that i did not want to see i was talked into it and dragged into the theater but boy am i glad for that i thought it was going to be just another love story but it turns out to be sooo much more than that definatly an intellectual flick one of those movies you have to pay attention to
shower is an story about loyalty about the unstoppable advance of modern world in the detriment of rather traditional and more human ways of life a man forced to choose between his successful career in business his big city life his wife and his retarded young brother the eternal doubt between what we want to do and what we should do the modern china versus the ancient one the public baths with its gatherings its cricket fights versus the shopping centres and the skyscraper lots of old men and women that are no longer needed china one country two systems as xiao ping said though one of them is killing the other br br tender moving full of funny moments and of bitter sweet ones the sensitive ones will cry and laugh equally the actors are enormous especially the one who performs the role of the retarded boy and yang zhang makes a good job easy simple letting the story just flow by itself br br my rate 8 10
i won't spend a lot of time nor energy on this comment i just want to add it because all the comments were so positive i felt like i just had to let people know that not everyone is so thrilled let alone intellectually provoked by this attempt at creating a captivating philosophical cinematic enigma some scenes seemed promising playing with visual dimensions but couldn't hold up the rest i felt like i was stoned for the first time again having semi philosophical conversations with fellow adolescents br br what a futile attempt to raise dutch cinema to new heights i'd rather watch jesus is een palestijn without all the pretentions and with straight forward humor also raising questions about life and the realities we create for ourselves br br gert de graff is not jean luc godard or tarkovsky and appearantly never will be
the movie was actually a romantic drama based on three sisters who had desires to become a famous girl group in their endeavors the oldest sister meets a drug dealer and street hustler called satin whom sister goes after because she believes he is the big time who will give her everything she ever thought she wanted out of life though he could be accused of killing her he really kills only her spirit and will to live after which she becomes a drug addict and ultimately dies from an overdose the story isn't about the street life or the italian mobster who tries to buy stix off then threatens him it's about how love can overcome even the worst tragedies in life as portrayed in song and style and the character that was the life in the times for young women trying to be discovered back then
i lived in tokyo for 7 months knowing the reality of long train commutes bike rides from the train station soup stands and other typical scenes depicted so well certainly added to my own appreciation for this film which i really really liked there are aspects of japanese life in this film painted with vivid colors but you don't have to speak japanese to enjoy this movie director suo's tricks were subtle for the most part i found his highlighting the character called tamako tamura with a soft filter making her sublime a tiny bit contrived but most of the directors tricks were so gentle that i was fully pulled in and just danced with his characters or cried or laughed aloud wonderful a
i think that the idea of the plot is perfect for exploring first of all the emotional experiences of the people involved and second as someone else wrote in a comment the implications of this kind of relationships incest and lesbianism in the romanian society br br so to begin with the second aspect to make it short it wasn't visible at all br br as for the first as i said it had much more potential i think that those kind of relationships carry much more tension much more tension and the potential tension didn't get through br br i think the soundtrack could've been more than those few songs on the background and the theme wich was nice but not enough and not always in the right moments yeah i could feel the absence of a better soundtrack br br the actors i think that they were somewhere from 7 to 8 10 not enough sensuality in the key moments br br a total of 7 10 mostly for the story
what is most striking about this semi musical set in 1920s berlin is the marvelous cinematography and editing it's top of the line from first national in these departments the story is mildly engaging and similar to the plots of miller's other two films sunny sally where working girl is romanced by rich boy with family disapproval complications and final clinch all the four musical numbers are bunched at the beginning of the film and we go for a long stretch without any further musical buoyancy miller sings parts of i think of baby and reprises because of you there are also don't ever be blue and though you're not the first one br br miller here is very engaging and delightful quite reminiscent of irene dunne in manner and delivery sad she does not dance as that is her forte sally remains her finest film with this trailing as second and the rather poor sunny a vastly inferior runner up her life was tragically cut short by a sinus infection before the days when hospitals and antibiotics made such tragedies preventable it's worth visiting these films though to see ziegfeld's top star of the twenties
this movie documents a transformative experience for a group of young men and the experience of watching it is in itself transformative for the viewer few movies even aspire to this level of transcendence and i can think of no other movie documentary or drama that achieves it there is no other movie in which i have both laughed so much and cried so much yes it is about dmd and accessible travel on those issues alone it is a worthwhile venture but it is more it is about friendship it is about life itself about living every day that you're alive and it's a great fun adventurous narrative this is why god created the cinema see this movie
words cannot begin to describe how blandly terrible this movie is i wish it were so bad it's good but it's not it's just dull lifeless and boring it's so bad i couldn't even laugh at it br br in response to other posters anne marie frigon is not the highlight of the movie the only person less charismatic is the director brett kelly who as a true statement on vanity cast himself as the male lead they both look like inbreeds sister and brother br br the gal sherry thurig is a looker the complete opposite of anne marie attractive this girl is tall and willowy and can act although you can tell she's holding back br br all the actors seem to be holding back especially the supporting male mark i've seen less wood in a rain forest but he's still better than kelly why would kelly keep his actors from acting is he really that bad a director everyone else has summed the story up perfectly there isn't one kids are kidnapped and kelly steps in poo to solve the crime i know how he felt stepping in the poo it's how i felt after watching his movie br br yes i tried to get my money back from the rental store this is a home movie best left to be seen by the friends of the director and if you search them out you'll see those same friends were the one who gave the movie positive marks
is it possible to give a movie no stars i suppose not however many stars imdb displays this just think zero and you'll get my drift director and photographer timothy hines didn't have much of a budget compared to spielberg's herculean effort with the same material rumored to be the most expensive movie ever made but that need not be an insurmountable handicap i've seen some wonderful work done on a comparative shoestring soldier and saints is a recent example with hard work integrity and above all talent it is certainly possible to realize a faithful rendition of wells' novella and at fraction of what was spent by dreamworks on its war of the worlds unfortunately hines failed in all these departments even if he had had spielberg's budget and tom cruise signed for the lead his movie would have stunk just as badly as this barnyard animal he's foisted on us br br primarily hines seems unable to tell a story thanks to digital video technology he can record images and sound but he shows little aptitude for assembling a narrative with what he records a guy walks down a country lane a lot he talks badly aped received english to some other guy then he walks down the same lane only shot from the back this time to show he's returning clever eh walking and talking for nearly an hour that's all that happens ok i'll grant that one extended excursion from the main character's house to the impact site on horsell common to show that it's a considerable distance from one place to the other might be useful a first year film student could storyboard a more economical and more aesthetical establishing sequence than this btw but half a dozen times back and forth back and forth et cetera et cetera with some yakkity yak in between remarkable the only explanation for this surfeit of redundancy other than total artistic ineptitude is a desire to pad out thirty minutes of wretchedly amateurish cg works into something that could be offered as a feature length film finally the martian fighting machines appear and the walking and talking becomes running and talking or shrieking later we get staggering and wailing for dessert br br thankfully much of the dialogue is lifted straight from h g wells' text else we'd have no idea what is going on but is it not the whole point of cinema to illuminate a text to realize what words alone can't convey if a film relies on dialogue or monologue to tell us what we see or how to feel why bother why not do a radio play orson welles made himself a household name doing just that however hines thinks he's a filmmaker so he's content to mouth the words and swallow the meaning br br secondly hines was able to buy some cg effects of a sort for his movie but he has no idea how to use them now i for one have no unquenchable sweet tooth for eye candy i believe good science fiction cinema doesn't need dazzling technical effects some really potent sci fi's have flourished on virtually none at all but the war of the worlds as film requires a certain baseline effort wells tells a story that hinges on things can be seen and heard and even smelled the effects don't need to be complex they can even be crude e g fighting machines on wires gliding over miniature streets as seen in the george pal byron haskins 1953 version but they must be handled well unfortunately hines' effects are both crude and incompetent  tripod fighting machines higher than a cathedral spire stomp around making a noise like a pogo stick bouncing on linoleum  martian squidoids even though oppressed by four times the gravity of their native world scurry and flit about without perceptible effort  skeletons totally denuded of flesh and muscle writhe and scream the same damn horse and buggy greenscreens its way across the foreground a dozen times flipped left for right occasionally in hope that we might not notice  and on ad nauseum crude technique is forgivable so you have a cg fire effect that's less than convincing fine we can work around that just don't use it too often and only show glimpses of it that stomped woman sequence looks more like a crushed plum throw it away it's not necessary you say your martian flyer looks like a toy on a string if you must use it go ahead but please don't show it twice but no hines won't listen we get the worst looking stuff used again and again gotta get those 180 minutes somehow boy br br next we have acting or more precisely too much acting whether in a speaking role or just paid to die on queue everybody in this film is acting his little heart out evidently hines thinks he's getting a bargain more fleeing in terror over there you quaking behind that tree let's have a real conniption fit this take you call that writhing in agony nonsense my grandmother can writhe better nevertheless the cast as a whole and individually stink they aren't even good amateurs but this needn't prove fatal many a good movie has been made with rancid acting that's what directors are for and editors which brings up another point who the hell let tim hines edit this cheese factory if america's butchers were as adept at meat cutting as hines is at film cutting your next hamburger would be all fingers and no beef in spite of the near three hour running time there is lots of stuff missing from this movie not sequences but single frames creating a herky jerky effect that's nauseating to watch maybe hines intention was to simulate the effect of a hand cranked cine camera of the 1890's if he was i can say he doesn't know how to do it
i was in second grade 12 years ago i remember it clearly we were learning about space all little kids want to go to space right well after i saw this i was so scared to death that i would 'accidentally' get flung into space by some psychotic robot with a one track mind i had no idea that this was a movie i thought it was some news program or something i guess it was my own version of when people were freaked out by the radio program 'war of the worlds ' so recently i get this movie again to watch realizing my favorite actor joaquin phoenix was in it then known as leaf phoenix i can tell you i was laughing at the dramatic parts and laughing even harder at the acting i mean when andy is in space she moves in slow motion did you ever notice that i don't think being in space makes you talk that slow or think that slow br br the best part is when andy is knocked unconscious by the oxygen tank and begins to float backwards as the security doors close little max is trying to pull her in suddenly we get a major close up on max's face as he shouts in slow motion whaaaaatttt'ssss happpeniiiinngggg i had no idea
this is a very bad movie i laughed once or twice and the storyline sucks there is maybe one funny joke it is stupid and it is boring through the whole short movie i was falling asleep and wondering when it was going to end br br no one acts human and everyone acts stupid and ridiculous rob schneider acting like an animal isn't something i would pay to see it looked funny but the bottom line don't waste you're precious time on such a ridiculous and stupid movie br br i was wondering when it was going to end even though it is a short movie in the beginning we thought it would get better but it gets worse stupid all the way to the end i walked out of the theater and i would remember that movie as extremely bad forever br br the writer and co producer of this film is a simpsons tv writer but this is nothing like the simpsons this movie sucks
prussic gas a murderer donning a red clansman suit and hood wielding a white whip and the murders of college school girls at the hands of paid convicts enlisted by a mysterious mastermind who keeps his face hidden within an office containing aquariums of turtles and fish the inspectors at scotland yard higgins ijoachim fuchsberger and his superior sir john siegfried schürenberg certainly have their hands full with this case it all seems to center around student ann portland uschi glas who when she turns 21 is to inherit a great deal of wealth the girls who are targeted share a room with ann but the reason for their murders remains a mystery sy's finest must figure out the staff of the girls' dormitory all seem to be hiding something and certain members of the faculty are falling prey to the killer in the red monk robe disguise talented enough to precisely strangle the necks of those attacked with the whip two prisoners are commissioned by a mystery man to use the newly created toxic gas created by a scientist murdered at the beginning of the film during what was supposed to be a monetary exchange for his creation it's a clever scheme where a driver greaves günter meisner meets the convicts who hide in a barrel who are assisted by a corrupt prison guard taken blindfolded to the secret room of the mastermind he gives them orders on who to kill and how uncovering this operation is a top priority for higgins and sir john for it will lead them to the truth they seek in regards to the murders and why they are happening under suspicion are girls' dormitory headmistress her author brother a sweaty incredibly nervous chemistry teacher a snooping gardener and the bannister some are red herrings until they are disposed of throwing the viewer for a loop each time until the real mastermind is discovered the ending features multiple twists br br out of the krimi films i've seen the college girl murders is the closest to a giallo with it's colorful killer a convoluted plot yielding lots of surprises and potential suspects sordid shenanigans between adults and the college girls at the dormitory i think you can also see the influence of james bond on this particular krimi film with the villain mastermind's secret hideout with an alligator pit which isn't used the fake bible water pistol when opened fires the gas into the face of startled victims the greaves' royles royce which has latches that cause flaps to darken the windows without revealing the passenger in the back seat and the peep holes used to spy on the girls in their rooms and while swimming many might consider sir john a liability due to his bumbling buffoonish behavior and how he often undermines higgins' abilities to get at the truth perhaps poking fun at know it all british inspectors who harm a case more than solve it i felt he was used as comedy relief particularly with his attempts at psychoanalyzing suspects and potential victims often misunderstanding what are told to him higgins using the skills adopted over his years as an investigator instead follows the clues facts often avoiding sir john as much as possible capable direction by the reliable alfred vohrer who keeps the pace humming at a nice speed and the screenplay is full of interesting characters and lurid content the fact that so many of the adults surrounding the dormitory are suspect any of them might be the one wielding the whip or calling the shots behind those murdered girls' executions i'd say this may be one of the best if not the best examples of the krimi genre for it keeps you guessing always one more ace up it's sleeve the revelations unearthed at the very end are quite eye opening and you even get a literal unmasking of the real mastermind pulling the strings to top it all off
i watched fido on some movie channel and i have to say that i've become an instant fan the film feels like a comic book that perfectly captures the look and feel of the surreal 1950s you know the wholesome decade when they danced to elvis while dropping nuclear bombs in the desert just for the heck of it people were so naive back then that it's frightening and the idea that those clean cut folks would find it normal to have zombies as pets actually works here br br kudos to this canadian production the colorful crisp cinematography and the excellent cast including carrie anne moss billy connolly henry czerny and the kid br br it's a shame this film wasn't a bigger hit it deserved more recognition it's much better than the stuff from tim burton or the shaun of the dead team oh well it's an instant classic nonetheless
cosimo luis guzman ends up in prison for car burglary and there he's given the plan for the perfect heist from a lifer in prison so he has to get out of jail fast he tells his girlfriend rosalind patricia clarkson to find a man who will do his time in prison for some money but no one wants to do the time for cosimo's crime and yet everybody seems to know a guy who will do that soon bad boxer pero mahalovic sam rockwell founds out the details of this so called perfect job br br first of all i think this movie was very funny and from my point of view i would recommend it to everyone this movie is remake of italian comedy i soliti ignoti i didn't watch the italian original so i cannot judge or compare those two movies but welcome to collinwood is great comedy for itself about four people trying to rob the money from the vault in one house everyone gave their part of brilliance from this movie cast really excellent movie for these actors sam rockwell william h macy great isaiah washington michael jeter great luis guzmán patricia clarkson jennifer esposito and finally george clooney gave their share in this project br br maybe to say that this movie is only comedy isn't fair this is more then that because of one difference all of thieves in this movie have very small wishes when they are asked what will they do with their money it is mostly securing their future in very humble way this fact goes beyond comedy into the soul of that criminals and not only them but also cop babitch who is presented like corrupted one so here directors russo presents us fact that criminals and cop are the same actually all in collinwood are and not only in collinwood cause all people chase money on legal or illegal way i don't like all movies were audience eventually likes and cheers for thieves but this one is exception you have to love them all riley with his little baby and wife in jail toto with his pants cosimo with his line your mother's a whore and all others they are just like characters in my favorite comic alan ford they all trying to make some money but simply they are out of luck but they all did one good deed they gave money to riley so he can get his wife out of prison they are all heroes in my eyes cause lots of honest people wouldn't do that
this was the most pointless film i have ever seen as there was no plot and the actors did not seem to care 90 of the film had absolutely no plot whatsoever i laughed so much my ribs began to ache the bit where the old men when to capture robert duvall was ludicrous on a directorial level making a noir film does not involve lots of raining sequences and pointless closeups on the main character this is a failed attempt to create a noir thriller and instead alienates the viewer with incoherent scenes seeing as this was based on a 'manuscript' by john grisham i do not count this as one of his book to film adaptations as it displays none of the suspense and engaging storyline as films such as 'the firm' or 'the rainmaker'
i appreciated the photography the textures the colours and often unlike one comment the lighting what was lacking for me was a coherent storyline i found it often disjointed badly edited and at times difficult to follow my version was 110 minutes imdb shows one at 125m possibly the cuts and subtitles didn't help i applaud any films that escape from the hollywood mould but this left me disappointed miss gillain was luminous and the performances were all fine i just wanted a little more dialogue if anyone would like to see another film that has some affinity with this one try 'hideous kinky'with kate winslet
foley's noir quality in this saturated and intense pulp film is seemingly perfectly fit together shot by shot edit by edit the film unfolds itself around a disturbed boxer discovering his own purpose or lack thereof the other comments around perhaps indicate a lack of pulp interest but i personally think this is a superbly put together cinematic piece
this film was an interesting take by hollywood on the novel by of the same name by pearl s buck while some today might think it is rife with racial stereotypes for the time the very idea of chinese protagonists was progressive in and of itself i found that the white actors playing chinese was not as bad as i expected that it wasn't the asian equivalent of blackface back then there were not really any asian actors in america not even george takei was acting and rainer did a good job with her part it wasn't the greatest performance i have ever seen but for old school pre method acting it was nice the locust scene was very well shot and contained convincing special effects br br i wonder that the timing of the release during the great depression sort of turns this film into an allegory especially the political upheaval bewildering the peasant farmers and how them seem to be left behind by all of it br br the film had some parallels to the john ford style but i think the eastern influence affected it as well if this had been an western family the locusts would have won at the end punishing the farmer for his pride lust and gluttony however here he learns his lesson then wins
five minutes into this movie you realize that you have seen it all before it is boiler room it is the firm and it is the devils advocate and there are no new elements here except for the all to clear bill gates allegory conpsiracies are always good stuff for movie making but why does it have to be so extreme boiler room is a good movie because it for a while at least seems realistic in antitrust everything is wrong how realistic is it for example that your boss pay an impostor to be your girlfriend in order to make you work harder and control you i'd give it 1 but the soundtrack is ok so 2 10
of the three remakes of this plot i like them all i have all three on vhs and in addition have a copy of this one on dvd there is just enough variation in the scripts to make all three entertaining and re watchable in addition has any other film been remade three times with such all star casts in each of course the main stars in this one are great but the supporting actors are also superb i particularly like william tracy as pepi he was such a scene stealer that i have searched to find other movies he is in he appeared in many but most are not available as the other comments i also say buy this one
i'm a big fan of italian films from the seventies and i wouldn't hesitate to list the beautiful barbara bouchet among my favourite actresses of all time so i did go into this film with some hopes however it soon becomes apparent that this is a largely pointless film that isn't going to go anywhere clearly nobody would go into this expecting much more but the fact that this is pointless gets more annoying when you consider that it's also rather dull and none of the characters are interesting as the title suggests the film focuses on a 'rogue' in this case one that steals womanises and smuggles stuff that's basically all the plot that this movie has the film does have a real 'seventies style' to it and the idea of it all being very carefree gets across well it sometimes seems like directors boro draskovic and gregory simpson were trying to put across some sort of point although whatever that point is doesn't come across very well seeing barbara bouchet on screen is always a pleasure and that is the case here too she's definitely the best thing about the film and the sequence in which she hangs out of a car naked is the best part of the film overall the rogue will probably have some appeal for people who love the seventies style but unfortunately it doesn't have much else to offer
john leguizemo a wonderful comic actor is a new york latino able to get inside a myriad of characters both male and female to show the bizarre foibles of an ethnic group trying to cope in an alien culture he is not however italian he doesn't look think or behave italian especially sicilian or calabrese immigrant groups who live in bensonhurst or bayridge brooklyn every scene in which he interacts with his gumbas rings false as though he'd wandered in from a college production of west side story while the other guys were doing a low rent mean streets that's only one problem with this ill conceived mean spirited flick spike blew this one big time btw cbgbomfug means country bluegrass blues and other music for uplifting gourmets or possibly gourmands ask hilly crystal who founded the club br br
this film may seem dated today but remember that it was made in 1974 before saturday night live before howard stern back when george carlin was just getting beyond the hippie dippie weatherman and into heavy satiric humor this film is the granddaddy of them all enjoy it for its historical significance as well as for its strong entertainment value
i'm not sure why spike lee made this train wreck of a movie and conned poor stevie wonder into eternally pairing his beautiful music with this theatrical mess i also resent the way he uses profanity as a part of the normal prose of professional blacks the abuse of his hold on ethnic movie goers is a shame scenes which seem to be contrived out the blue and have nothing to do with the theme or sub themes play as if some college kid wrote this i especially detest the ludicrous scene where the two leads are playfully sparring for no reason at all and the cops come and rough up snipes the overacting of the leads makes one feel as if spike has no respect for his viewers or he has no clue what a movie is all about the final scene appears to be thrown in to justify the use of a sledge hammer to tack a point in this movie also supports the myth that all people of culture use the f word in casual conversation i am hoping he will realize that the rest of his movies are in the same pool as this one where he is not growing as a film maker i think his union with scorcesee in clockers was a wise move he should stick to making documentaries like the four little colored girls shock movies do not an oscar make
this is a badly made poor remake of bimalda's classic parineeta the story is based on sarat chandra's book of the same name and it is a distortion of the original well one can appreciate some degree of creativity but not sham creativity the acting by everyone is affected and the entire movie is a sham shekar's father's choice of words in abusing lolita balan sounds cheap and morbid and destroys the spirit of the original story again the scene where shekhar saif slaps lolita is quite out of place with the flow of the movie and the characters is quite jarring to the senses and could have been easily avoided similarly the sex scene between saif and balan is quite unbecoming the movie and a cheap gimmick to attract the audience when a creative work is not faithful to the original and destroys it's spirit the work falls apart the song piyu bole is quite ok another silver lining in the dark cloud of this movie is the scene where saif stands up for himself and rebels against his father this is a positive departure from the original and deserves credit on these counts this movie deserves 3 stars the song and dance by rekha smacks of artifice and it is a put on the song is tuneful but i remember having heard it somewhere before and if iam not mistaken the tune appears to have been plagiarized br br well agreed the times have changed from then to now but then this movie is not even reflective of the modern times br br this is what happens when the modern bollywood film makers get increasingly obsessed with impressing the nris and grabbing the lucrative nri entertainment market such movies end up neither belonging to india nor to any other part of the world
while the original first blood had its far fetched moments it was at least exciting in parts in rambo first blood part ii the emphasis is shifted very much onto comic book action plausibility is totally rejected logic nose dives stallone becomes so impregnable that there can be no doubt he will succeed in his mission just like any other wish fulfilment actioner of that time e g invasion usa commando red scorpion rambo first blood part ii cancels out its own opportunities for real excitement by presenting a hero too invulnerable to fear for if you can tell from the word go that rambo is going to wipe out hundreds of enemy soldiers what is left to get excited about br br imprisoned after the events of the first movie john j rambo sylvester stallone is offered a pardon if he will join a covert operation in the far east the year is 1985 and a mission is being arranged to find out if there are any american pows still trapped in the jungles of vietnam rambo is encouraged to take the job by his old mentor colonel trautman richard crenna but the assignment is actually the brainchild of a government outfit fronted by marshall murdock charles napier rambo's job is merely to head for a prison camp in the jungle and check out if it contains any american pows  if it doesn't he is to rendezvous with a chopper if it does he is to get photographic evidence of their existence so that they can be rescued at a later date aiding him in his quest is a lady soldier with local knowledge the beautiful and resourceful co bao julia nickson sure enough rambo discovers that there are pows in the camp but he exceeds his orders by rescuing one of them when he reaches the rendezvous point the rescue chopper abandons him on the orders of murdock who it seems doesn't really want to find any pows because of the political and military implications rambo is captured by the enemy and tortured but following an explosive escape he sets out to free the pows and get his revenge on the treacherous murdock br br the few good points of the film come from jack cardiff's polished photography jerry goldsmith's exhilarating score and the sheer professionalism of the stunt team in performing various action antics beyond these scant pickings the film is a failure the actors are reduced to macho posturing the plot rings false the action sequences are soulless and suspenseless the dialogue is absurd even the violence becomes numbingly predictable at the time of its release america was under the presidency of ronald reagan a man with simplistic and near hysterical anti communist sentiments for this reason contemporary audiences lapped up this commie bashing shooting fest as if it was the greatest movie of all time transforming it into an undeserved box office success thankfully times have changed  nowadays we can look upon it as a simple minded action flick with a ludicrously high body count ludicrously dumb politics and a ludicrous hero
taiwanese director ang lee whose previous films include 'sense and sensibility' and 'the ice storm' turned to the american civil war for his latest feature based on a novel by daniel woodrell it follows the exploits of a group of southern guerrillas known as bushwhackers as they fight their northern equivalents the jayhawkers in the backwater of missouri br br as one might expect there is plenty of visceral action but the focus is on the tension that the war put on the young men who fought it many of whom were fighting against their former neighbours and even family jake roedel tobey maguire is such a man or rather boy as he is only seventeen when the war reaches missouri he is the son of a german immigrant but instead of following his countrymen and becoming a unionist he joins his lifelong friend jack bull chiles skeet ulrich and rides with the bushwhackers despite a lack of acceptance because of his ancestry and an unwillingness to participate in the murder of unarmed union men he remains loyal to the cause so does his friend daniel holt jeffrey wright a black slave freed by another bushwhacker and so fighting for the south br br lee handles the subject with aplomb never rushing the deep introspection that the plot demands in favour of action and this lends the film a sense of the reality of war long periods of boredom and waiting interposed with occasional flashes of intensely terrifying fighting the action is unglamorised and admirably candid recognising that both sides committed a great number of atrocities br br the performances are superb with maguire and wright both courageous and dignified up and coming irish actor jonathan rhys meyers is particularly chilling as a cold blooded killer while skeet ulrich is enjoyably suave and arrogant lee never flinches from the reality of war but his actors do an admirable job of showing the good that comes from it the growth of friendship the demonstration of courage and on a wider scale the emancipation of oppressed peoples ride with the devil is a beautiful and deeply compassionate film that regularly shocks but always moves the audience
well the previews looked funny and i usually don't go to movies on opening night especially with my kids because well you never know here is a movie that doesn't appeal either to children or adults as the jokes are too perverse for children and falls completely flat for entertainment purposes for adults i was actually embarrassed to be with my 9 and 6 year old and having to explain to my 6 year old what s h t spells essentially what happens here is a total twisting of dr seuss's classic it adds an evil and lazy neighbor who wants to marry the children's mother for her money if that was a subplot then maybe that would have been fine but it ends up being the major plot around the whole movie and the cat plays more of a subplot role in exposing the neighbor to the mom for who he really is take my advice and read the book and pass on the movie
this crap is like watching paint dry i'm so disappointed because i was so eager to see it br br there simply is no meaning to this film if it were never made no one would notice or care it's hyped up because of all the big names in it but if nobody's were in nobody would give this film any love br br seriously i was at the point where half way through the film i would look at vanessa redgrave and think hurry up and die already this is like the joy luck club without any of the friggin' joy it's the ocean's 13 nothing but a big named cast of mother daughter movies and completely anti climatic oh until it's finally over br br i'm sure they'll all be nominated for oscars br br 4 stars for cinematography and the ability to convince great actresses to commit to this junk
i was hoping that this film was going to be at least watchable the plot was weak to say the least i was expecting a lot more considering the cast line up i wonder if any of them will include this on their cvs at least i didn't pay to rent it the best part of the film is definitely dani behr but the rest of the film is complete and utter pants
dressed to kill has been more or less forgotten in critical circles in the past 20 years but it is a true american classic a film which is much more than just a glossy thriller br br i sincerely hope the dvd release will give more people the chance to hear about it and see it
this wasn't really a very good movie there were lots of implausible and predictable things that happened during the course of the film but i think that most of the reviewers are missing the point of why this movie should be enjoyed by a wide audience this movie was produced by magic johnson isn't that enough to inspire us all to check out this film a film produced by a former nba star doesn't come along every day you know beautifully stupid kids in a big house getting slashed by an axe wielding psycho every cliché trotted out for us to groan over teen sex and it was all produced by magic johnson i can't say enough about this movie teen drug use college hijinx and it was all produced by magic johnson yippeeee
audiences today will probably watch a film like ossessione and not really consider how unprecedented it was during the time when it came out the structure of the film really divorces from sap happy hollywood conventionsas well as other major theatrical elements it relies more upon depicting reality in a very grim and sober light films of this naturethe neo realist filmswere made to reflect the darkness felt during post world war ii times ossessione tackles some fairly provocative issues that were probably unseen on screen prior to the war including adultery conspiracy murder pregnancy etc aside from the one crane shot and certain musical swelling moments the film aesthetic is very raw and gritty shot on location uses natural lighting and most likely non popular actors all of these elements helped convey the issues explored in the film yielding the following theme negative karmic repercussions will haunt those who deliberately act immorally br br the two leadsgino and giovannaare polar opposites yet both carry the mentality we're bored and we want to be entertained gino is a drifter a lone traveler who embraces life and its constant fluctuations giovanna is a bored house wife cemented in the familiarly of marital permanence she doesn't want to leave her home and husband but would rather remain where she is because it's safer gino's lifestyle represents the ideal lifestyle giovanna craves the only difference is that she's too afraid to live it herselfthat's why she falls in love with gino he represents everything she wants but doesn't have the courage to get she wants to live in a world free from the monotony of living with her corpulent husbandgino is the perfect ticket into that world the affair that ensues between the two most likely left audiences back in the 40's feeling somewhat uneasy i mean films prior to the neo realist age never showed such scandalous behavior on screen before to say the least it was probably a bit alarming br br in conjunction with the theme the neo realist style helps show the negative repercussions of adulterous behavior succinctly put adulterous behavior as shown in the film leads to depressing and ultimately deadened lives when gino and giovanna conspire with each other to eliminate giovanna's husband karma comes to haunt them like a plague after the deed is done they return to their home the atmosphere is dark and biting as can be expected from the neo realist style they are not happy they're actually more depressed they thought that by eliminating giovanna's husband that they'd live happier lives but they were duped the film ends with giovanna's deathit being in karmic similitude of her husband's death i think this is a very satisfying ending for several reasons here's why br br there's a lot of talk as to whether or not evil should be depicted on screen and if so to what extent i think depicting evil is very necessary if and only if the evil depicted is not being glorified but rather shows what negative consequences evil actions have as the subtext of ossessione asks is adultery and murder evil i think the film eagerly responds yes the adulterous behavior between the two reveals how unhappy they are ironically though towards the end of the film when they seem to be healed of their depression and are seen basking in each other's arms inside the car the author of the film shows that their happiness is in fact a façade the car crashes off the cliff and into the river killing giovanna the police arrest gino i think it was the author's intention to say that even though people sometimes try and justify their immoral behavior in the end karma will come back to haunt them i agree i think the two got what was coming to them because they both were incredibly selfishalways wanting instant gratification and not willing to endure through hard times this was especially made clear after the first sign of difficulty that gino and giovanna experience in their relationship he can't handle the pressure of living in giovanna's husband shadow so he leaves giovanna and sleeps with another girl such is typical of the insatiable hedonistic personality br br all in all the film seemed very risky for its time the audience however was prepared to see such a film because of the sobriety the war brought those pre war happy go lucky films were no longer being believed movie going audiences were ready to see and contemplate difficult films with complex characters they wanted to see characters whose lives were entangled in so called 'sin' because it was a reflection of their own life problems ossessione then acts as a great catalyst for where the future of film was heading that is a lot of the naturalism pieces we see today can be said to have been influenced by the neo realist film movement
if you want scream or anything like the big studio horror product that we get forced on us these days don't bother this well written film kept me up thinking about all it had to say importance of myth in our lives to make it make sense how children interpret the world and the violence in it our ransacking of the environment and ignorance of its history and legends all here but not flatly on the surface you could technically call it a monster movie even though the wendigo does not take physical form until the end and then it's even up to you and your beliefs as to what's happening with the legendary spirit beast some standard thriller elements for those looking just for the basics and the film never bores though in fact the less you see of the creature the better fessenden successfully continues george romero's tradition of using the genre as parable and as a discussion forum while still keeping us creeped out
this is the kind of movie that leaves you with one impression story writing is what movie making is about br br incredible visual effects very good acting especially from shue everything is perfect except the story is just poor and so everything fails br br picture this if you had the power to be invisible what would you do well our mad scientist here played by kevin bacon could think of no other thing to do but fondle and rape women this is all his supposedly genius mind could think of does he try to gain extra power no he doesn't even bother research a way to get back to being visible the guy is basically a sex crazed maniac br br add to that the lab atmosphere you have all these young guys throwing around jokes like they were in a bar if it wasn't for all the white coats and equipment you would think this is a bad imitation of cheers very shallow and poor personalities and very little care is put into making you think these guys are anything but lambs for the hollow man's wolf br br even as a thriller the movie falls way short because most of the thrilling scenes are written out so poorly and are full of illogical behaviors by the actors that are just screaming this is just a stupid thing i have to do so that the hollow man can find me alone and kill me br br if you read the actual book while the scientist cane goes after women there is a lot of mental manipulation and disturbing thought that goes into his character in the movie cane is just the sick guy who goes to a crowded marketplace to rub his body in women and get off on it just sad
a very straight nice old lady desperate for money to save her house and possessions grows pot in her house smokes it with a few old biddy friends and then sells it that's the story for this low key comedy emphasizing the absurdity of the situation and some of the humor the predicament brings for much of the film it works the humor isn't of the laugh out loud variety but it does keep you entertained for an hour and a half so i guess it serves its purpose br br there are funny moments and brenda blethyn is fun to watch in the lead role but the ending really ruined a cute movie with insultingly bad messages that only the ultra liberals of the film world would like to see happen br br like most people i would prefer a happy ending too but it should not all warm and fuzzy for those who blatantly break the law also in here are the typical 1 children out of wedlock but that poses no problem and is deemed okay 2 clerics portrayed as morally weak people and 3 even a medical doctor who gets stoned too br br hello and reviewers here blast hollywood this is exhibit a how a secular society has lowered the standards in the uk and europe in general hey people at least have a trace of morality instead of nothing but a timothy leary if it feels good do it message
police story is one of jackie chan's classic films that helped shape the hong kong cinema it is a masterpiece that should not be missed by any action movie fan from the beginning it is obvious that jackie chan's stunt team literally risked their live to make this film both the action and the stunts are extremely realistic and innovative even today no movie has outdone police story in dangerous stunts many people were hospitalized in police story including jackie chan the fighting is not as indisputably exceptional as the stunts but the fighting in this movie helped change and define jackie chan's use of props throughout the film chan uses odd object to stop attackers and is constantly throwing assailants through thick glass the action feels real because the stuntmen are giving the movie all they have to give and jackie chan's coordination is outstanding br br the rest of the aspects of the film are not without flaws but they will not disappoint any action fan chan not only plays a believable risk taking cop but shows the powerful changes that his character goes through as he falls into escalating desperation the plot is powerful but a modern viewer may find it tedious at times while the comedy will provide a good number of laughs it does not always distract the audience from the lack of action however for the time period it was made in the driving aspects of the plot are entertaining there a good number of interesting and well played characters dispersed throughout the film as well br br overall police story is without a doubt one of the best action movies ever made and even in hollywood the influences of this one film are not to be ignored
when i saw the dentist i thought it was very cool but this movie is not for everyone especially people who do not like gory scenes as the dentist has lots of gory scenes that's why it has it's r18 rating it's about a beverly hills dentist dr alan feinstone who finds his wife brooke cheating on him with the poolman it's best to go to your dentist before you watch this but if you don't like going to the dentist already then it's best not to watch this as you may be put off going for life the dentist has the best bloody revenge in it that i've ever seen who has ever seen a movie that has a dentist spoiler pull out all his cheating wife's teeth and cut out her tongue with no anesthetic overall awesome flick but not for everyone
earth is a must see for children and adults my son had great fun watching all these funny birds and ice bears we can learn a lot from this movie and we should be proud on our great treasure on earth there are some animals in danger to disappear exactly that problem should prevent all the authorities of our planet br br this documentary offers many exceptional pictures that i have never seen before then it is well accompanied by a heavenly music the director did a great job here that gets high respect nothing can stop me and my family to give earth the highest rate i hope so much that the stuff will create a sequel
this musical is decidedly mixed and none of the elements really fit together but it somehow manages to be mostly enjoyable the plot contains some of the elements of wodehouse's novel but none of its virtues though he co wrote the script the songs though charming have nothing to do with this particular film and are unusually crudely squeezed into the plot even by pre oklahoma standards burns and allen do their usual shtick quite competently but it misses the tone of the rest of the film by about forty iq points br br there are a few high points reginald gardiner does good work when he remembers that this is a talkie and stops mugging like a silent actor and there are a few bits of writing which could only have been written by wodehouse though most of the film feels like the production of one of the hollywood meetings he later parodied
there is nothing unique in either the tv series nor the movie which is a prequel to the tv show that isn't found everywhere else in life and entertainment both before david lynches disgusting style of story telling and after br br from the moment the body of a poor misguided girl washed up on the beach and being introduced to some of the most mind numbing shady immoral character of the twin peaks br br to the mind numbing almost pedophilia disgusting way the movie seems to romantically tell of the destruction of a human life through some random psychedelic phenomena in the movie twin peak fire come walk with me br br i watched it all just to make sure i wasn't missing anything i didn't it's is simply one mans obvious sexual fetish extended over long series fallowed by a ridiculous overly pornographic movie save your self the agony the suspense and watch anything else that at least has the ability to tell a story rather then seduce you into some kind mental porn movie br br i have heard a lot of reviews rants and raves about how great david lynch because of his ability to define misery and and tragedy and making it into some kind of a wonderful thing this is not life imitating art as much as it is some sick twisted version of art doing its best to inspire complete mindless life br br do yourself a favor and avoid this garbage
any film that deals with bigotry in a positive manner is a film that should still be seen by current audiences as the message and moral of the story will always be relevant as long as we have a world full of bigotry br br aside from that the film is really an old fashioned love story boy meets girl boys loses girl boy gets girl back br br the weakest role goes to the late kent smith as lt general webster riccardo montalban is a close second my question would be how did he ever get to be a 3 star general the character is such a wimp in the presence of his wife and military subordinates it's a wonder they show him any respect at all br br brando's southern accent is a little overdone and some scenes have a few holes but overall i enjoy the film every time i see it br br red buttons is great i always love seeing comedians in dramatic roles as in button's case often a comedian can better portray the tragedy of a person than a more traditional dramatic actor
house of games has a strong story where obsession and illusion play a big part a psychologist offers to help a patient with his gambling debts and gets caught at the game br br have you ever felt fascination for something that was both dangerous and wrong watch what happens if you pursue this urge and go all the way sit on the edge of your chair as tricksters are being tricked and victims turn into perpetrators you're never sure of who is exactly who in this movie br br this is both a quality and a drawback of the script as the movie ends you feel that the story lacks a bit of consistency but all this is largely compensated by the excellent psychological development br br this is definitely one of the best movies about gambling
i think that this film was one of kurt russels good movies kurt russel is my favorite actor so i think that he is a good actor in any role he plays but this movie had a lot of action in it and i know that it should have more then a 5 6 out of 10 on the meter but many people did not like this movie oh well i thought it was good so i think that every one should see this movie if you see this movie and like it i think that you should see back draft also with kurt russel i give soldier 1 2 out of
cartoon network seems to be desperate for ratings beginning with the cancellation of samurai jack the network seemed hellbent on removing all the shows that made it so popular such as the powerpuff girls dexter's lab dragonball z etc when the ratings started to plummet cn began putting up some pretty mediocre shows though total drama island action and chowder stand out because of their clever writing and audience pleasing gimmicks there are plenty of other shows that either terrible remakes george of the jungle or rip offs of other shows such as the marvelous misadventures of flapjack where the title character acts just like spongebob and then there's johnny test which is something of a replacement for dexter's laboratory though it's much more of a sheer rip off than anything br br the show's characters are clearly derived from dexter's lab only this time the focus is on johnny a blonde or fiery haired character who torments his twin sisters susan and mary who just happen to look just like dexter from the orange hair to the glasses the impossible technology there is even a rival genius named bling bling boy or eugene who appears to be sitting in for mandark then there's dookie johnny's best friend and talking dog one of dexter's i mean susan and mary's early experiments br br dexter's laboratory was probably one of the best cartoons on television with its simple but effective art style lovable main character and episodes that don't seem to be a long drag johnny test is a lot different the art style here isn't nearly as eye pleasing in fact it looks absolutely awful the characters have motivations that make them really annoying or repulsive like how most of the series' episodes consist johnny and dookie's quest for havoc on the neighborhood girl sissy whom johnny secretly likes or the twins' obsession over a boy next door seeing these two geniuses swoon at the sight of abs and the fact that johnny appears to be someone you would never want to associate with there is no real connection between the viewer and characters br br one thing the series heavily exploits in its name is that johnny is susan and mary's guinea pig for their experiments these range from turning johnny fat ugly monstrous and even into a woman the twins then help johnny in whatever scheme he's planning in return for his services whenever there's an episode involving this kind of win win deal it usually comes undone at the seems and those that doesn't come completely off the rails never ends satisfyingly br br the writing ranges from mediocre to horrid however the 'fat' episode constantly repeats it's phat with a ph there's a difference you know which is a line that should never be repeated especially when the episode seems to promote child obesity with johnny becoming a famous star with money and videogames just by becoming fat br br let's talk about how the show doesn't completely rip off dexter's lab the show tosses in a lot of characters from two men in black named mr black and mr white a military general who seems to need all his problems solved through johnny and his sisters and lots of super villains though even here the show again steals ideas for other sources like a mr freeze teenage clone an evil cat with a butler who wants cats to rule over man like the evil talking cat from powerpuff girls a bumbling maniac mastermind a trio of evil skater 'dudes' and even a mole man which is probably the most cliché villain in the media br br to top it all off alongside its ugly animation and unlikeable characters the voice acting is either passable like the voices for mr black and mr white to just plain ear splitting johnny dookie and just about every villain in the show the theme song seems to be the only catchy thing to this show but then it was redone just a few episodes with a band that just ruined it br br so in the end johnny test is not a good cartoon its horrible references and jokes about teen culture will dismantle little children's interest in the show while its bright coloring ripped off characters and dragging episodes will ruin the experience for teens it's just another one of those crappy shows that cartoon network is over promoting to trick people to watching it like mtv toward rap if you need a show that will satisfy your children for a half hour you'd better stick to spongebob because johnny test is more of a test of patience than anything else
i found this to be a so so romance drama that has a nice ending and a generally nice feel to it it's not a hallmark hall of fame type family film with sleeping before marriage considered normal behavior but considering it stars jane fonda and robert de niro i would have expected a lot rougher movie at least language wise br br the most memorable part of the film is the portrayal of how difficult it must be to learn how to read and write when you are already an adult that's the big theme of the movie and it involves some touching scenes but to be honest the film isn't that memorable br br it's still a fairly mild nice tale that i would be happy to recommend
the three stooges has always been some of the many actors that i have loved i love just about every one of the shorts that they have made i love all six of the stooges curly shemp moe larry joe and curly joe all of the shorts are hilarious and also star many other great actors and actresses which a lot of them was in many of the shorts in my opinion the three stooges is some of the greatest actors ever and is the all time funniest comedy team br br this is a good three stooges short it funny and its cast includes christine mcintyre symona boniface gino corrado fred kelsey sam flint chester conklin theodore lorch lynton brent judy malcolm vernon dent john tyrrell heinie conklin and bess flowers the stooges performed very well in this short i recommend this one
i don't have words to describe how good this movie is only a genius like amrita pritam could have written such a real depiction of the days of partition the movie kept haunting me for many days br br urmila did the role of her life in this movie she put life in the role of puroo and manoj vajpai did no less in his role as rashid it is hard to imagine anyone other than these two doing the role of puroo and rashid the punjabi costumes looked so natural on urmila and manoj looked like a natural punjabi mussalmaan br br sandhali sinha as lajjo and suri as ramchand did fabulous job priyanshu chattarjee did good work as triloki br br some of the scenes you just can't get out of your mind when puroo meets lajjo for the first time it brings tears to your eyes the climax is just killer i was expecting a tragic ending but thankfully the ending was wonderful br br this movie is in the same category as pakeezah mughal e azam banaras etc not to be missed
now i recently had the viewing pleasure to watch the hilarious comedy bachelor party one of my new favorite comedies laughed until it just hurt type of movies so i naturally wanted to see the sequel hoping it would have the same laughs but instead bachelor party 2 the last temptation is made by the american pie generation where it's tasteless and defeats the hole purpose of the first film yeah the first film has nudity but it doesn't show in every single scene also the plot is exactly the same from the first it's not always a complaint with me but this could have been a little more original the only thing is that i'm glad that at least no old actors from the original appear in this movie because it would have been cheesy or really silly looking br br ron and melinda are engaged after only 2 months of dating everyone is against it melinda has a rich family but they're pretty happy with ron and melinda's brother todd is scared that ron will take his job so they go out on a weekend to miami for a bachelor party and todd is going to make sure that he'll trap ron into a picture that will make melinda change her mind about the marriage br br bachelor party 2 the last temptation has a couple laughs here and there but over all fails to deliver what the first film accomplished these guys ron's friends were more obnoxious than likable except for seth he was kinda funny the only likable characters other than seth is ron and melinda everyone else just more or less gets on your nerves you wanna watch this film just watch girls gone wild it's the same thing only it doesn't try to pretend that it's a film stick to the original bachelor party that's the movie that's going to get you in tears of laughter br br 3 10
i couldn't give this film a bad rating or bad review for two reasons robin williams and toni collete the film has the potential of being a thriller and there are some slight disturbing elements that lean to the psychological which was something the film could have focused a little on robin williams plays gabriel noon a storytelling night time deejay who is going through personal issues his lover moves out and gabriel is having what seems to be a case of storyteller's block one day he receives and reads a story written by a dying 14 year old boy named pete boland rory culkin pete tells the story of his life and the abuse he suffered at the hands of his parents he lives with his adopted mother and social worker donna boland toni collette gabriel is fascinated and begins a friendship with pete but things seem strange when gabriel attempts to meet him and discovers the possibility that pete boland may not even exist i won't go into detail because i don't want to spoil the film but i will tell you this it is quite predictable fascinating atmosphere for telling a story and good performances from robin williams and toni collette who i thought was the film's key character collette is without question one of the most talented and loveliest actresses her ability to tap into the psyche and personality of the characters she portrays is very uncanny and i hope to see her win an oscar hell i think she might pull off getting a best supporting actress nod for this one if the script were a little better the film starts off as a psychological thriller but a predictable one at that if your curious to know the film's ending and twists then see the film otherwise i would rent another predictable thriller called hide and seek
will they ever make movies without nudity and sex this came on at 3 00 on sunday afternoon and i couldn't believe what they showed thank god my son was outside or i would have been freaked out if he had seen the soft medium porn do people who make movies not care who they offend or corrupt kids could have been watching after church and that is what they show the acting was good and i enjoyed the suspense but gee there was violence and bad guys but that is to be expected in a western movie randy travis was really good in his role if the writers directors and producers would just quit putting on so much uncalled for sex scenes what has to happen to get them to quit going in that direction where can i complain
with that line starts one silly boring british sci fi film the great vorelli from the movie devil doll builds a teleportation machine only to have his funding cut off by blanchard a bearded man who has a thing for bow ties and men with large eye brows when his experiment fails the good doctor learns that lembach the man who controls all of the grants in the world will be staying in london for a few days he attempts to project himself into the house of blanchard with the help of his comely lab assistant sheila needless to say something goes wrong and he winds up looking like a rat the rest of the movie is devoted to the good orange haired doctor walking around london shocking people with his mutated hand and wearing a diaper on his face there are some more killings some modest paper work and finally the doctor vanishes to where ever rat faced doctors go thankfully no one decided to make a sequel
this is a frank loesser masterpiece of amusing lyrics competent themes and solid construction by those who adapted damon runyon material to the musical's book what is surprising about the film is how seamlessly the musical numbers flow from the storyline abe burrows did the book with contributions from loesser michael kidd was the choreographer and the outstanding art direction was contributed by joseph wright the storyline can be told in two sentences nathan detroit played by frank sinatra needs cash to finance his permanent floating crap game to amuse big julie a chicago mob boss he bets odds player sky masterson well presented by marlon brando that he cannot get a salvation army girl to go to havana with him masterson wins the bet saves the mission falls in love with the girl gets the gamblers and riffraff at the crap game to attend a service and tells everybody the lady was impervious to his charms a complete lie of course he ends up with the lady and detroit marries hi long suffering fiancée vivian blaine others in the cast include stubby kaye johnny silver robert keith b s pulley as big julie the mobster sheldon leonard regis toomey mary alan kokanson kathryn givney as the salvation army leader veda ann borg and jean simmons as the tepid salvation army girl sarah brown the famous musical numbers in this award winning broadway smash include fugue for tinhorns guys and dolls luck be a lady i'll know a person could develop a cold and the oldest established permnanet floating crap game in new york joseph l mankiewicz of cleopatra and letter to three wives fame directed the proceedings and the flow of the work is very interestingly and successfully kept moving he is equally adept at getting fine dialogue acting and directing such huge numbers as luck be lady the varied and challenging brawl section the havana a woman in love section created for the film that precedes it the presenting of the title song guys and dolls and pet me poppa set in the club where blaine works the acting is very uneven simmons seems wrong for the part at times brando gets by with the singing and is very good much of the time on instinct charm and underplaying even in the comedy scenes sinatra tries hard but is wrong for the role for several reasons as nathan detroit blaine is a bit too theatrical in selling her numbers which she of course sings professionally leonard toomey kaye keith and pulley do what is asked and more at all points the stylized opening and closing are made to work well all in all this film is a triumph for loesser's amiable and subtle lyrics for director mankiewicz as ringmaster and for the genre of musicals itself so ably justified in this instance delightful and very different
obviously written for the stage lightweight but worthwhile how can you go wrong with ralph richardson olivier and merle oberon
yikes did this movie blow the characters were weak the plot weaker i figured this couldn't be too bad because it has christoper walken oops he must have done this because he was bored and needed the money the characters were supposed to be irish but noone had an irish accent i am desperately trying to find something nice about this i can't except walken did a fine job with a wooden character find something to read or watch discovery don't ever see this movie
let me set the scene it is the school holidays and there is absolutely nothing at the movies i am with my friend deciding what to see we look for a movie that is starting soon and the grinch comes up we buy tickets not knowing what to expect what we got was a roller coaster of fun br br jim carrey who may i add is my no 1 actor in the whole world was absolutely magnificent as the grinch in this ron howard's best movie next to apollo 13 the way that this movie was made the scenery the actors the props and the music was just amazing it really brought this childhood movie to life br br the story is based upon the story of the grinch as we all know the grinch is a horrible person who just can't stand christmas he lives high above whoville and has never mingled well with the townfolk but one little girl is going to change the grinch's look on life and on others in a drastic way br br cindy lou who played by adorable new actress taylor momsem meets the grinch as finds the kind part of him straight away she attempts to break the barrier and to help the grinch move in and mingle with the towns people br br all up this movie is a barrel of laughs for the whole family both kids and parents a solid 10 10 well done jim br br
amazing movie i saw this movie for the first time on a flight and could not believe that i had not even heard of it before getting on that plane while it may seem at first to be a chick flick it is a film that everyone should see and will enjoy men watch this movie with someone you love you will enjoy it as much as she does and it will score you big points
i truly wish i was not writing this review i'm a christian so i waited anxiously to see this movie it seemed great a christian movie with some fairly famous stars and a plot that seemed intriguing not that i buy the bible code itself you can make it say anything you want i do however believe everything inside the bible so i'm sitting on the edge of my seat enjoying the previews when the movie comes on and manages to destroy my mood in a matter of minutes i had to bite my lip to stop from commenting on the terrible writing and acting while i was in the theater i would have been torn to pieces by the people cheering at the rather clumsy but basically uplifting scenes and gasping at the insanely obvious and predictable tension scenes i'm sure once the final credits began to roll however i could reflect there were many parts of the movie i liked some mostly unexpected plot twists some effects that were indeed special i'm not counting the visions those were poorly done and some interesting technical work fades sets that type of thing unfortunately i got the distinct impression that if i read the book of revelation to a monkey and set the monkey in front of a typewriter for an hour i could've gotten a better script and the music was beyond cheesy even for a bond fan who likes kinda cheesy music in scenes of action and intrigue so i wish i could be like everyone else in the theater like the people who came out crying and breathless because of how incredible it was but i'm not someone who can be appeased by a writer who throws some words over a biblical shell and slaps a christian stamp on it i need a good plot and believable dialogue before i can enjoy most movies and this just didn't have either i'm sorry but i wouldn't recommend this film to anyone and that's the tragedy when will we see some intelligent christian fiction it has to be out there somewhere
i generally find loretta young hard to take too concerned with her looks and too ladylike in all the wrong ways but in this lyrical frank borzage romance and even though she's playing a low self esteem patsy who puts up with entirely too much bullying from paramour spencer tracy she's direct and honest and irresistible it's an odd little movie played mostly in a one room shack in a hooverville unusually up front about the depression yet romantic and idealized tracy playing a blustery hard to take regular guy who would be an awful chauvinist and bully by today's standards softens his character's hard edge and almost makes him appealing there's good supporting work from marjorie rambeau and glenda farrell who never got as far as she should have and jo swerling's screenplay is modest and efficient but the real heroes are borzage who always liked to dramatize true love in lyrical close up and young you sort of want to slap her and tell her character to wise up she's too good for this guy but she's so dewy and persuasive you contentedly watch their story play out to a satisfying conclusion
girlfight is a story about a troubled teen named diana guzman michelle rodriguez diana is burdened by her mothers suicide and a sexist father living in a sexist community a short temper and plenty of things to spark a fire shes about to get kicked out of school for fighting her brother tiny ray santiago is training with hector jaime tirelli in boxing diana is told by her dad sandro paul calderon to deliver that weeks payment for tiny's training while diana is walking through the gym she realizes thats what she wants to do she wants to box diana asks her dad for money to train but he refuses because shes a girl and should do more 'girly' things all diana wants is to be treated like any other guy not looked down upon because she is a woman she steals money from her father to begin training br br great movie genius pure 'effing' genius recommend to anybody who needs to see a good clean movie with no 'monkey business'
this motion picture has a steady haunting pace backed up with great acting one of chamberlain's best performances and a story that is revealed to us over time br br beyond that the music fully establishes the mood and assists in maintaining an uneasy cautious and somber tone br br weir's story is enhanced by using aboriginals their stories and their tensions with the dominant white population to deliver a fantasy tale that is ominous br br although they are unrelated in story as well as genre this maintained the same feeling within me as ursula le guin's lathe of heaven 1980 br br the last wave is a dramatic thriller with some shocking moments remember hacking and slicing doesn't make a film a horror movie it's the psychological element of fear and trepidation that rests within us all
if you liked watching mel gibson in million dollar hotel then you might enjoy watching burt reynolds in yet another film so bad it could never be distributed i can only attest to the dvd version so maybe the vhs version is better quality wise but the movies night and dark scenes have been so poorly done that everythings seems red i first thought my dvd players was messed up it wasn't if you insist on watching it i recommend you adjust the color on your tv until it is black and white if you don't you will never be able to get through the film if you do it will simply remind you of a poor film students attempt to revist the style of pulp fiction
just saw this movie on tv and i have to admit i was a bit surprised it was even on there were so many goofs mess ups and bad editing that an old episode of sesame street would have been better to watch the acting was ok but please you can really feel the straight to video feeling the cast crew made this movie a bad melodrama yes there is a message in the movie but just wait until ten minutes before the ending to hear it trust me you wouldn't even tell the difference
frank capra's creativity must have been just about spent by the time he made this film while it has a few charming moments and many wonderful performers capra's outright recycling of not just the script but considerable footage from his first version of this story broadway bill 1934 is downright shoddy it is understandable that he would re use footage from the climactic horse race which is thrilling but he uses entire dialogue scenes with minor actors then brings back those actors and apparently expects us not to notice for example that ward bond is 14 years older unless you want to see one of the last appearances of oliver hardy skip this one and watch broadway bill instead
criminals perry smith and richard dick hickock believe mr clutter of holcomb kansas keeps a large supply of cash on hand in a safe on november 15 1959 at two a m they end up murdering mr and mrs clutter and their teenage son and daughter after a little police investigation the two men are found and sentenced to be hanged in cold blood 1967 is directed by richard brooks now i haven't read the truman capote novel this movie is based on so i can't make any comparisons the movie does a brilliant job telling of those horrific events that actually took place robert blake is excellent as perry of course blake had the murder case of his own a few years back being accused of murdering his wife he's free now but we still don't know the truth what ever that may be he's still a very fine actor scott wilson does remarkable job as hickock john forsythe is terrific as alvin dewey paul stewart is very good as jensen jeff corey is marvelous as mr hickock same thing with charles mcgraw who plays tex smith john mcliam portrays herbert clutter ruth storey is his wife bonnie brenda currin is the daughter nancy and paul hough is the son kenyon great job by each of them there is much to remember from this film let's start from the lighter side it's pretty great when perry wants to go hunting for gold in mexico and says to hickock remember bogart in treasure of the sierra madre and blake himself was in that movie as a boy and it's a fun moment when they giving a ride to that boy and his granddad collect bottles and turn them in for refund money those darker moments are the most haunting ones the flashback sequence where you see the murders happening is extremely terrifying when perry goes to kill the girl nancy last and she says oh please don't the brutality of man it's impossible to explain then the hanging scene first there goes hickock and then perry first talking to the minister in the last image of the movie we see perry hitting the end of the rope sure movies and books may try to sympathize these villains especially perry's character is someone you could feel sorry for he thinks of his mom and dad who he hates but still loves but it doesn't change the fact both of these men these actors portray are brutal murderers who don't feel sorry for anybody they go to this house and murder an entire family in cold blood how could you sympathize these people
i truly enjoyed this film the acting was terrific as was the plot jeff combs has more talent than he is recognized for the only part of this flick i would change was the ending the death of the creature was far too gruesome for the sci fi channel br br there were some interesting religious messages in this film jeff combs obviously played a messiah figure and the creature or shark if you prefer represented the anti chirst there were some particularly frightening scenes that had that 'end of the world feel' i only noticed this after my third viewing of this classic creature feature i know many people won't get the references to christianity but if you watch close you'll get it
i rented this film on netflix after it won all the oscars to see if it was really that good br br the hurt locker is a very realistic portrayal for the most part of a group of soldier's rotation in iraq the film centers around will james a reckless soldier who gets his adrenaline fix from taking risks and defusing bombs br br where this film seems to lack in my opinion is the plot and direction of the movie this film has no clear plot unlike other films such as black hawk down what this film tries to do is focus more on the characters and their different attitudes about the war bigelow does an okay job of focusing on the characters but there are many points in the film where the dialogue seems to drag hurt locker is 131 minutes long yet it feels like a 3 hour movie br br one scene in the movie that was particularly awful and ruined the films perfect credibility was the sniping scene halfway through the movie it was both unrealistic and very long br br overall i thought this film was okay but the reason i gave it a 6 instead of a 7 was because it was a major letdown for winning best picture at the oscars i felt like this film could have been so much better considering saving private ryan lost best picture but was much better than this film another notable mention is black hawk down which only won 2 oscars i honestly do not know how this won best picture br br if you are looking for an action packed war flick rent black hawk down this film will be forgotten in a year or two
after a fairly lengthy partially pixelated nude shower scene we're off to the races for this blair witch project esquire horror film about three girlfriends venturing to a desolate cabin deep in the woods to get away from their hectic lives for a girls' weekend out and smoke pot they meet two guys who seem friendly enough so they drink and tell ghost stories until late in the movie some of them get picked off br br this is a fairly slow movie with needlessly drawn out 'suspense' scenes the bad acting can't carry the myriad of scenes where nothing happens but mindless banter and the movie as a whole is a dud a deathly boring dud at that nothing at all happens until the last half hour and when it did i was to numb to really care br br eye candy ashley totin shows t a evy lutzky gets topless briefly and jennifer hart shows her right tit br br my grade d
it is a great movie if you have ever named your cars or are really into old fast or exotic cars it has a plot and a lot of action the car scenes are great except for the totally fake car jump scene all of the other scenes are great i really enjoyed it and i hope everyone else does as well
believe it or not inspector gadget's last case is what got me hooked on the whole gadget thing br br my name is miriam and i am twelve years old so obviously i wasn't around when inspector gadget was at the top of his career sure i'd heard of him but i didn't really know him br br while reading note that i never saw the original series i would if it came on this is just about the only gadget thing i've ever watched even though i am now obsessed and i will be focusing on what i liked about it since everyone else is so negative for all you pessimists i've got some cons down there too p first off for a childish sense of humor you could deem this movie pretty funny i thought it was so sue me i also thought the animation and character designs were good and i'm also happy there was more gadget in it since he's my favorite character i do not like penny then there was claw his voice was awful though and the madcat i thought they were done fairly good too gadget's idiocy seemed pretty well in place if not a bit exaggerated i e sucking his hat hand thing's thumb would make a good screen shot though p oh and i liked the song that ran in the credits yes i am strange br br and like all movies there are some negatives too br br talking cars what's up with that you can tell this was aimed at younger boys that wouldn't bother me quite so much if there wasn't the fact that the cars basically saved the day i would have much preferred if penny and brain had taken their place and apparently gadget loved his car more than would be called natural a bit weird to say the least br br oh and the chief was downright mean to gadget i mean sheesh yeah he wasn't always the most cheerful of people but he didn't hate gadget from what i've read like the inspector his personality was exaggerated br br well that's pretty much all i have to say about this movie i thought the animation made up for the car centered plot and that it was overall pretty decent more so than the live action gadget films butchered butchered butchered at least maybe i'm just biased because this is what got me into gadget in the first place or maybe my mind is twisted or maybe i'm just odd but i really liked this movie even if i'm the oldest it's recommended for

i think this cartoon is one of the worst cartoons i have ever watched i would recommend this cartoon to people who are under 5 i did used to like this show when i was 4 and 5 i still only watched it when there was nothing on now i am other 5 and i would rather do my homework than watch it the cartoon used to be a bit funny but they were not enough to make me burst out laughing now i am older i am interested in show witch are not rated us i have started to watch doctor who 12a torchwood 15 and sarah jane adventures pg i am interested in things to do with doctor who so i am not interested in 5 year old cartoons this cartoon didn't last very long it only had 6 seasons it got cancelled because of it was low on viewers but some people say it was because the writers ran out of ideas but for most other shows they have at least 8 seasons
this is a movie which attempts a retelling of thai history set in the ancient city of ayutthaya i decided to watch this film because i thought it was along the lines of many thai films i've watched and enjoyed one that has thai actors speaking thai and martial arts craziness well it's none of that this film is shot entirely in english is chock full of anglo actors and has production values so terrible it is laughably bad but not funny who can we blame for this rubbish the acting dialog and most of the sets were quite bad some of the fight scenes looked like they were choreographed by the local high school drama club the special effects were also mostly bad but a few were just cheap animation patched onto the screen that provided an especially cheesy effect it has one large epic style outdoor battle scene where a few thousand extras get to run across a field in costume but when we see the two armies collide in combat ha what a joke the film does feature a couple of beauties what a pity they didn't show a little more skin at least that would have been something for the guys to appreciate don't bother
i'm studying catalan and was delighted to find el mar a movie with mostly catalan dialogue at my art house video store br br hmmm not so delighted to have seen it br br yes as other reviewers have said it's well made and beautifully photographed although the opening sequence of the children is shockingly violent it's well acted and convincing for the most part that is would the mallorquins strip a corpse in preparation for burial right in the middle of the town square in full view of the dead man's 10 year old boy oh well minor detail up to this point it had something of the feel of a non magical pan's labyrinth also set in the spanish civil war br br fast forward and the three children who survived the opening incident have come of age francisca is a nun working at a tuberculosis sanatorium and the two boys manuel and ramallo both are patients i know but hey coincidences happen br br the problem as with so many spanish movies apologies to almodovar fans is that with one exception francisca the characters are just so dang weird their motivations personalities and dialogue are often simply incoherent br br what's more it descends into some horrific wretched excess be prepared for lots of pain and lots of blood the reviewer who called it a potboiler is quite on track if it had been made 40 years ago the poster would've said see forbidden love rape murder mutilation fanaticism animal cruelty betrayal br br the opening sequence is not nearly enough to make the personalities and relationships of the characters believable to work this should have had multiple flashbacks to flesh out the characters as it is it seems a bizarre and depressing cross between brother sun sister moon and pulp fiction if that sounds like something you've got to see by all means enjoy i think i go with something that doesn't make me feel i need to take a shower to wash off the gore and gloom br br as for the catalan it's the mallorqui dialect fairly different than the barcelona dialect though i was surprised by the comment that said that even barcelonans apparently needed catalan subtitles to understand it
what's to like about this movie br br it is in colour br br it has some impressive underwater photography br br it has a rhythmic musical score in the background that works well at times br br so 3 out of 10 br br sometimes the music is speeded up especially when the shark or the baddies are about to move in br br sometimes it is slowed as if to convey to the audience it's about to be time for sympathy br br as another one bites the dust as if in a spagetti western this has much similarity to br br it's not that the italians can't produce quality productions there was a series of tv movies with a heading like octopus numbered about 1 to 7 screened on sbs tv in australia in the 1990s about mafia type conflicts and they were excellent but alas you won't find it here br br i assumed it was made about 1960s sadly it was 20 years out of date as evidenced by a funeral scene near the end br br then there was the razor sharp bite of the speedy shark that makes for a red dust repeatedly emerging in the bluish waters br br amidst it all either in bar room brawl or in observing the latest sea side bloody demolition by the relentlessly hungry shark the mate of the hero looks on through his glasses of little concern as if he too was bored in his relentless role amidst a lack of much evidence of plot or anyone's character development br br at least the hero indicates a fleeting concern belatedly for his ex wife br br but of course even if the music fails to awaken our realisation we have the sinister sound in the baddies' voices as if to nudge us that another dark deed is about to emerge br br and near the end someone thought of a twist just when we thought it was all totally predictable but stay tuned folks for you may find another twist if you are watching closely to more or less warm your heart br br follow the advice of the hero and have a few beers along the way it'll make your viewing of night of the sharks more enjoyable br br then you'll be ready for something like a 007 movie to ease your way back into reality when this is over
br br the main question i pose concerning this film is how do you film a cole porter musical and only use 3 of his 15 songs merman and lahr played the lead roles on broadway here they are replaced by the weaker red skelton and lucille ball plot changes abound and the fun is lost br br skip it
revolution is a terrible movie i don't care if you're a history teacher news writer al pacino fan there's no way this movie can possibly earn a legitimate '10' br br the key point to the plot is tom dobb al trying to get money from a note he got for radical patriots taking his boat everything revolves around that note tom's son joins the army to make up for the note making tom join the army as well they go on an adventure trying to get out of the army years later the war is over and they can finally turn in the note for their boat the end br br it had a few battle scenes and they were pretty mediocre at best transistions between scenes used five months later and magically put the characters in some famous historical battle the love story is a joke and the movie as a whole is just hard to follow so save your notes and watch the patriot instead
this was directed by ruggero deodato a true icon to many horror film fans after he directed the seminal and notorious cannibal holocaust however don't expect to find any such notoriety in the film reviewed here as it proves to be incredibly tame in comparison and plays more like a conan inspired outing for a young audience br br such a description may instantly put off most fans of the whole conan inspired sword sorcery genre but before you turn your nose up at this it has to be said this movie is just so much fun br br it's mostly played for laughs and features two huge and highly likable heroes in the form of david and peter paul aka the barbarian brothers who both seem to be having a ball with their characters br br b movie favourite richard lynch turns up as the main villain in the piece and it's also great to see roles for big george eastman and michael berryman br br added to this the ladies are stunning to behold and suitably scantily attired throughout the films duration a staple and much welcomed ingredient in the genre br br what can i say this simply is a really fun and lighthearted take on the genre and i recommend it wholeheartedly
after life is a miracle i did not expect much it's hard to believe that these films were made by the same man as do you remember dolly bell for instance zavet is two hours of silly antics with no story the wild and unbridled humor of underground seems to have degenerated into pathetic buffoonery here it appears that kusturica has been going steadily downhill since he started making life affirming comedies beginning with black cat white cat which i think was great but already had some disturbing signs of dementia i liked his early films so much and this is why it's especially disappointing to see something like this let's hope his next one will be great
i decided to watch this because of the recommendations from this site i would have to say it was worth the effort however you should take heed that this film will go on for 210 minutes if you don't have the staying power get it on tape and watch it over a couple of nights br br now to the film what i say will contain spoilers and if you don't mind here goes br br alexandre is a promiscuous bum a womanizer and a gigolo he lives with an older woman called marie marie owns a retail shop and she provides for alex alex spends his days at cafés and restaurants the story reveals that alex had previously impregnated gilberte whom he used to live with gilberte dumped him for a less attractive man that she did not love because alex had abused and battered her at this point alex was willing to get a job and and help raise their child before he found out gilberte had aborted it and planned to marry someone else br br by chance alexandre meets a nurse nymph called veronika and they striked up a relationship veronika fell in love with alex for the first time after all the sordid sex she had with men in the past marie and veronika struggles for alex's affection and had a ménage à trois to boot finally at the end it's revealed veronika is pregnant with alex's child and alex asked her to marry him we assume as aforesaid with gilberte's situation alexandre will even get a job and be the provider for his new found love and family there is hope br br with the title of la maman et la putain i deduce jean eustache was relating to françoise lebrun's character of veronika she was a whore and then she became the mother hence the mother and whore is the same person anyway what do i know french films are mostly not all very chatty aimlessly political preaching theatrical insipid lamenting and full of quotes lebrun and léaud played their obdurate characters well and held the film together as some part of the script became a little lost and disjointed br br not a bad effort 7 10
icy and lethal ace hit man tony arzenta a divinely smooth and commanding performance by alain delon wants to quit the assassination business but the dangerous mobsters he works for won't let him after his wife and child are killed arzenta declares open season on everyone responsible for their deaths director duccio tessari relates the absorbing story at a constant snappy pace maintains a properly serious and no nonsense tone throughout stages the stirring shoot outs and exciting car chases with considerable rip snorting brio and punctuates the narrative with jolting outbursts of explosive bloody violence delon's suave and charismatic presence adds extra class to the already engrossing proceedings this film further benefits from sterling acting by a bang up cast with praiseworthy contributions by richard conte as wise mafia kingpin nick gusto carla gravini as arzenta's supportive lady friend sandra marc porel as arzenta's loyal pal domenico maggio anton diffring as ruthless calculating capo grunwald and lino troisi as the venomous gangster rocco cutitta silvano ippoliti's glossy cinematography boasts several graceful pans gianni ferrio's funky score hits the get down groovy spot erika blanc and rosalba neri pop up briefly in nifty bit parts better still there's no filler to speak of and we even get a decent dab of tasty gratuitous female nudity the startling conclusion packs a mean and lingering wallop right to the gut a solid and satisfying winner
wow this one sucks i'm gonna sum it up as quickly as possible   br br a count invites 4 naive sluts back to his castle a bunch of nothing happens for a long time some lame and un erotic soft core sex scenes happen some girls get their heads cut off off screen the end br br the only things going for this one are the decent looking sets and costumes some bad dubbing which leads to some unintentionally funny dialogue and a few brief nudie shots and believe me those things are not enough to redeem the 90 minutes of tedium that this film is in fact the best part is the tacked on beginning from the distributor that features some slutty goth chicks covered in blood and showing their tits and again this is definitely not worth the price of admission for this garbage as everyone else has noted the title of the film is completely nonsensical as there's absolutely no bloodsucking nor dancing of any sort in the film at all it may as well have been called 'the goat raper leads the circle jerk' and at least then it would have had a better title that also pertains to nothing in the film an accurate title would have been '90 minutes of torture' another alluring title that would have at least been truthful for the viewer honestly the trailer that's on the disc shows all the best parts and i use the term 'best' extremely loosely so i highly suggest watching that instead if you're still curious  i can't imagine anyone liking this wreck of a film please take my advice and leave this one on the shelf 2 10 
a doctor who is trying to complete the medical dream of transplantation is experimenting secretly on corpses from the hospital with varying success his final best chance comes when he lovingly wraps his girlfriend's head in his jacket as he rescues it from a burning vehicle br br i was looking for cheese and with this premise i believed i found it it has everything everything that bad movie hunters look for chest and brain surgery with the surgeons leaving with pristine white scrubs unique camera angles i always love watching the rear passenger wheels of cars cheesy clarinet stripper music and one of the longest death scenes in movie history but unfortunately these so bad they are good moments can't overcome the too bad they stink stretches br br jan in the pan annoyed me with her droning monologues in a hoarse whisper the somewhat less than evil laughter and the fact she was kept alive with some columbian home brew coffee and 2 dd batteries br br i couldn't even entertain myself with dr bill's horrid overacting and moral self righteousness usually such ham makes these movies a must see in my opinion in this case i was bored with it br br the best part of the movie in my opinion was the 1960's version of body shopping and i even found myself nodding off during that br br don't spend money on this one there are better bad movies out there to entertain your sick sense of humor
there are no people like show people marion davies as peggy pepper and william haines as billy boone my introduction to ms davies was a clip from this film the delightfully spoofy one in which she lowers a scarf to reveal different emotions my introduction to mr haines was in viewing this film presently though it's possible i've seen him in a less memorable role haines makes an incredible impression when he joins davies for a commissary meal tossing his hat into the ring with some wonderful bits at the dining table indeed haines and davies deliver great comic performances br br the story starts off with dell henderson colonel pepper driving daughter davies into hollywood certain she will become tinseltown's newest sensation indeed davies and the already arrived haines become comedy stars but davies yearns to become a true drama queen davies leaves haines and partners up with the dashingly dramatic paul ralli but audiences prefer davies in more comic roles perhaps director king vidor is offering up a case for art imitating life br br full of great hollywood location footage both on the set and off full of great cameos at a studio lunch at the stars' table davies sits between douglas fairbanks and william s hart the best bit player however is charlie chaplin who has enough nerve to ask davies for her autograph while the cameos are fun they and the episodic sequences do help show people become less of an important film and more of an important historical document br br show people 11 11 28 king vidor marion davies william haines dell henderson
it's really unfortunate that most people outside of canada think that the only things that canada produces are snow mounties and hockey players this film is the second superlative canadian film i have seen within the past few weeks the first was the red violin far better than all but the best hollywood efforts br br gustad noble is anything but that he is a middle aged parsi bank employee in bombay in the 1970s this film sensitively explores various things that happen to him concerning his family his friends and his work and their effect on him at the same time it is a fascinating and i would assume accurate portrayal of middle class urban life in india at the time br br however i was somewhat prepared for this having read rohinton mistry's book a few years ago the film as might be expected cannot capture all the complexities of the book but if you want to read a really good book and see a really good film read and see such a long journey
i really wanted to like this movie it has a nice prison setting conspiracy theories bloodthirsty zombies a perfectly hideous 80s touch and it is a directorial effort by actor john saxon who also plays a bad you guessed it a bad guy it reminds me of some beloved italian horror flicks but the direction is very wooden and there is no nightmarish frightening moment in there it just goes on and on and on and then it logically has to end more suspense and more daring visuals and its destiny as a cult classic would have been sealed
joe don baker he was great in walking tall and had a good bit part in goldeneye but here in final justice all hope is gone the dark side has won br br as with most of humanity my main experience with this one was on mst3k and what an experience it was mike and the robots dig their claws deep into baker's ample flesh and skewer this flick completely it's obvious they were just beginning with mitchell on their anti joe don kick and here lies their continuation on a theme br br it makes for a funny experience though there are plenty of choice riffs my favorites john rhys davies for sale it's 'meatloaf texas ranger' none of them are sponge worthy why was she wearing her prom dress to bed and my favorite 'son of a ' what what was he the son of son of a preacher man br br by itself final justice is as joe don puts it in the movie a big fat nada but here it actually has some entertainment value you get a chance catch this version of final justice br br two stars for final justice ten for the mst3k version only br br oh and try not to visit malta when joe don's in town
i saw this movie on the film festival of rotterdam jan '06 and followed the discussion between director and public afterwards many people reacted shocked and protesting he will get a lot of negative critics but the world is cruel like this and it's not funny people don't like it that itself doesn't mean that the movie is bad i can see that difference don't shoot the messenger that shows us the world outside our 'hubble' nevertheless i think this a bad movie film technically it's a good one nice shots and script most good fitting music great actors the director pretends to make a psychological movie the psychology however is of poor quality describing such a powerful violence itself is not the art the art would be a powerful description of the psychological process behind that violence how does a shy boy come to such a cruelty the director pretends to describe that but is not good in that br br the director used several times the word the 'selfishness' of people mentioning for instance the teacher only this teacher wasn't selfish just someone in several roles caring for his pupils ánd worried about his script i think it's a simplification to call him selfish the atmosphere in the village is creepy and the mother made awful mistakes 'you terribly let me down' but it doesn't become believable for me that there is caused súch a lot of pain that the shyest boy comes to such terrible things in fact reality is far more complex than the way this film describes  and it needs far better descriptions the interesting thing would be how does it work describe that process for me please so that we understand br br with the written phrase on the end the director said to point to an alternative way of life it was the other extreme and confirmed for me that director and scriptwriter are bad psychologists promoting black white thinking the connection between violence in films and in society has been proved use such a violence gives the responsibility to use it right there are enough black white thinkers in the world causing lots of war and misery i hope this movie won't be successful
i absolutely loved this soap it has been one of my favorite will highly recommend i just love brazilian soaps they deal with real life events i'm really sad that the soap ended but i'm sure i'll be able to find it somewhere for those of you who have not seen it please see it i loved the characters the plot and how things turned out in the end for the villains the only thing i would have changed is the end for xica and her long life love i can't wait to see it again and highly recommend it xica has been by far the best soap i have ever seen forget everything else go xica hope you all like it as well
why has this not been released i kind of thought it must be a bit rubbish since it hasn't been how wrong can a girl be this film is in a word enthralling br br you will be captivated it holds your attention from the start and its pace never slows br br the final part of the film the episode as it were not giving anything away you saw that in the trailer is also unmissable you will chose a favourite you will be shocked you wont be able to go and make a cup of coffee because you need to find out what happens the adrenalin rises and you cant not watch cudos to the actors it's very believable and it doesn't stop there they have a final shock for you br br it also makes you question reality tv and if you would watch and how far away from this are we really endemol who make big brother made a tv show in holland last year offering a dying woman's kidney to patients in need of a transplant the show was revealed at the end to be a hoax ostensibly to raise awareness of organ donation but are we getting too close for comfort
carriers follows the exploits of two guys and two gals in a stolen mercedes with the words road warrior on the hood hightailing it down the highway for the beach with surfboards strapped to the top of their car brian chris pine of star trek is driving and his girlfriend bobby piper perabo of coyote ugly has shotgun while brian's younger brother danny lou taylor pucci of fanboys and his friend not exactly girlfriend kate emily vancamp of the ring 2 occupy the backseat this quartet of twentysomething characters are living in a nightmare apparently a viral pandemic which co directors co scenarists alex pastor and david pastor tell us absolutely nothing about has devastated america naturally the lack of exposition shaves off at least fifteen minutes that would have slowed down this cynical melodrama about how humans degenerate in a crisis and become their own worst enemies br br this lethal virus gives you the shingles and then you bleed and die most everybody runs around wearing those white masks strapped to their nose and mouth by a thin rubber band initially this foursome encounters a desperate father frank christopher meloni of runaway bride and his cute little daughter jodie kiernan shipka of land of the lost blocking the highway with their suv brian swerves around frank when he tries to waylay them but in the process the oil pan in their mercedes ruptures and they wind up on foot reluctantly they hitch a ride with frank after they seal jodie up in the rear of the suv she wears a mask over her nose and mouth and it is speckled with blood frank has heard that doctors are curing ailing people at a hospital and they head to it sadly somebody has lied to frank the hospital physician is giving the last couple of kids some kool aid that will put them out of their misery the cure did not improve their condition everybody else in town is dead kate tries without success to get a dial tone on every phone frank realizes that there is no hope for his daughter and he lets the heroic quartet appropriate his suv and take off br br indeed carriers qualifies as a relentlessly depressing movie about the effects of a pandemic on four sympathetic people who degenerate into homicidal murderers to protect themselves they reach a country club and frolic around on a golf course until another four show up in suits and masks with pump action shotguns incredibly our protagonists manage to escape without getting shot but brian has a scare when he almost falls into the water with a floating corpse eventually they discover that one of them has become infected later as they are about to run out of gas brian blocks the highway like frank did at the outset danny tries to stop a pair of older christian women driving the car danny lies that his pregnant wife is about to give birth and he needs their help brian throws caution to the wind and blasts away at the ladies with his automatic pistol when they refuse to help them brian catches a slug in the leg from the passenger but he kills her br br no carriers is not a beer pizza movie that you can either laugh off or laugh with because the humor is virtually non existent by the end of this 84 minute movie our heroes have turned into villains who only care only for themselves and their plight chris pine makes quite an impression as fun loving brian and his energetic performance is the only reason to hang with this hokum while the only other well known actress piper perabo is relegated to an inconsequential girlfriend role as bobby she makes tragic the mistake of showing compassion to a dying little girl and pays an awful price it is a testament to pine's performance that he can change his character to the point of putting himself before others essentially pine has the only role that gives him the ability to pull a one eighty from happy go lucky guy to heartless guy br br the two directors are spanish brothers and they never let the momentum flag since there is no relief in sight carriers sinks into predictability irréversible cinematographer benoît debie does a fantastic job with his widescreen lensing and as unsavory as this road trip becomes debie makes it look like a dynamic film aside from the lack of a happy ending or closure in any sense of the word carriers suffers because it is so horribly cynical the scene when the german shepherd attacks danny conjures up the most suspense but even it could have been improved unfortunately the pastor brothers do not scare up either much tension or suspense by fade out you really don't care what happens to anybody
i am a motion picture production major at wright state university in ohio and yesterday i was sadly given the opportunity to watch this god awful film in class we were informed by our professor that it would be very funny to us but the reason we were watching it was because it was one of the first sound films a complete disaster br br the problem with early sound films was that hollywood actors only knew how to do silent movies and they weren't good at memorizing lines so producers and directors would look to the stage to get actors sounds like a great idea right well the kind of acting one does on stage doesn't show up too well on film most of the actors in atlantic look and sound like they're acting in a play which results in lots of hearty laughs at the over acting another limitation of early sound film was the technology of microphones you couldn't move the mikes like you can today you had to keep them static or it would pick up the sound of air moving through there was usually one mike used in any given scene in this movie in one particular scene there is a man sitting at a table someone walks right up to him and delivers their line then walks away another actor comes up from behind him delivers their line then walks away it goes on like this for a couple more people the microphone is obviously right by the man at the table making for a laughable actor carousel br br those are only technical problems if you get into the story and direction then it gets even worse the story is a fictionalized account of what happened on the titanic the characters are unbelievable and pointless a story about a man cheating on his wife and their teenage daughter has no place in the movie it is barely resolved and leaves you wondering why it was there in the first place a lousy attempt at high drama the actors take long pregnant pauses between lines many times it is tiresome and you can't wait for this 90 minute feels like 180 at least movie to get over with i'm not going to talk a whole lot about the issue of racism at this time in our country but it really offended me that there were only two blacks in the whole movie and they were portrayed as animals they both pushed past the women and children to try and get in one of the lifeboats they were ordered to stop or be shot and of course they didn't so they were shot i was appalled br br i give this movie a 2 10 i would have given it a 1 10 the lowest rating possible but i gave it an extra point just because it was one of the first sound films and i tried to put it into context if you want to see a good early sound film check out alfred hitchcock's blackmail that also came out in the year 1929 you will find that the best directors were able to adapt to new technology immediately
i lost my father at a very young age so young in fact that i have no recollection of him over the years i have learned many things about him one of those things was that he loved westerns and watching bonanza every sunday evening was an absolute ritual for him i myself remember the tail end of the series' run having been 8 years old when the show ceased production in 1973 watching this show over the years somehow makes me closer to my long ago lost father it has all the right elements to make a show successful laughter tears edge of your seat suspense and it even angered you at times my most vivid memory of the show's original run came shortly after the death of our beloved hoss cartwright dan blocker one particular episode and the end of the closing credits flashed a picture of blocker and faded to black and i can also recall my oldest sister with a tear in her eye at the sight of this i can remember this as though it were yesterday on behalf of my late father who is not here to say so himself we love bonanza long live the cartwrights
without a doubt 12 monkeys is one of the best films of the sci fi genre and director terry gilliam is no stranger at pulling off such cinematic originality an apocalyptic film that holds you completely spellbound 12 monkeys never lets up and has you guessing all the way throughout excellent use of philadelphia locales and netherworld sets create a gothic sense of tragedy and two people caught in time at the wrong place br br bruce willis escapes his macho image and portrays a true loony who happens to be right about all that will happen he is actually sane but the people of the future or present if you will distort this guy's head so bad through time travel no wonder he unravels he gets sent to world war i just after beng sent to the wrong year to find out how the army of the twelve monkeys pulls off the annihilation of civilization as we know it they finally get it right and in what is truly a remarkable screenplay to match the performance we get to see willis madeleine stowe and an ominous brad pitt cross referenced over the course of 6 years br br stowe is sensual and solid as the risk taking shrink who slowly starts to realize that willis may not be as cracked up as he seems a captivating element of the relationship between her and willis is their sense of seeing each other before in another place or time 12 monkeys is essentially about time and the madness the futuristic people immerse into it and the times of the present when killers and a psychotic genius can alter the world br br the brooding city of philadelphia is a dark and gothic backdrop for willis' plight to complete his mission which is against all usual hollywood stereotype not to save the world he is gathering information the film plays tricks on the viewer as well placing willis in a new setting at the drop of a pin this must have been an extremely difficult picture to make but gilliam seems to be the master of hard boiled movie making he even drops in some humor reminiscent of other great works like time bandits and brazil the screen is this man's canvas and he knows how to paint a sometimes terrifying picture of the world and its possible future within the mainstream atmosphere of big budget films if you want sincere madness and ironic tragedy see 12 monkeys br br rating 9 of 10
i was not expecting much from this movie but was very pleasantly surprised as it is light and funny and very well observed the central trio of deadbeat bikers were surprisingly likable as they staggered and clowned their way through their drug centred trip to wales the humour was gentle and subtle as indeed were the three characters witness their sympathetic treatment of the little old lady shopkeeper the atmospherics of rural wales were captured perfectly and the soundtrack was very well chosen cleverly and carefully scripted with great attention to detail i have never seen such a realistic portrayal of alternative culture i felt i was there with them very light in touch and full of fun not what you might expect from a movie about bikers and drugs a delight on all fronts and difficult to criticise though i thought the last two scenes were a bit lame the film should have ended when they left wales but overall an unexpected treasure of a film
holy crap this was the worst film i have seen in a long time all the performances are fine but there is no plot really no plot a bunch of clowns talk about this and that and that's your film ug robert duvall's character is senile and keeps asking the same people the same qestions over and over this earns him the same responses over and over i am pretty sure this film got upto a six because people think they should like it good performances with famous and well regarded actors but the actual complete work is a steamy turd well maybe that's a bit deceptive since steam rising from a fresh pile sounds a little like something happening and in this film nothing happens sack
there is a reason this went straight to video the story is smarmy nick cage plays johnny in a sleazy way sex in churches and other scenes that border on tasteless like the scene in the laundry room taint this movie judge reinhold as the cuckold is okay but the movie itself with its themes of degradation and revenge are not well done but it is a good film for trivia contests because so few people saw it
i don't know what it is about donald sutherland's acting style or vocal style but he always seems to be acting from behind a massive wad of soggy kleenex he's just i don't know thick somnambulistic on meds weird br br that said i just saw the flick again for the first time since its original release and frankly i don't remember it ending anything like that a bad ending too because nothing gets tied off what about the dead husband the annoying child and was the kid dubbed the scotland yard and military pursuers i would have liked something wrapping things up and giving some dramatic closure to it all not just the big panoramic pull away br br and what woman sleeps with the man she knows just killed her husband even if she was trying to allay needle's suspicions to protect her kid she could always have had a headache that last encounter made me feel way too itchy and uncomfortable
this was so far the worst movie i have seen in my entire life and i have seen some really bad movies i saw this movie at my local video store and the cover looked like it could be a decent horror movie little did i know that the cover would be the best part of the movie where to start the filming of the movie was scattered and boring at one point there is a one minute scene of no one talking just a car driving to a ranch on a normal sunny day nothing happened they just drove in silence the whole movie is boring with annoying unbelievable dialogue and basically no plot to speak of if you rent this movie watch it with some friends and it might make a good comedy otherwise when you see this movie run
it seems like anybody can make a movie nowadays it's like all you need is a camera a group of people to be your cast and crew a script and a little money and walla you have a movie problem is that talent isn't always part of this equation and often times these kind of low budget films turn out to be duds the video store shelves are filled with these so called films these aren't even guilty pleasures they're just a waste of celluloid that are better off forgotten troma entertainment is known for making trash cinema but most of their films are b movie gold however some of the films they've put out they had nothing to do with making and some like 'nightmare weekend ' didn't deserve any form of release at all br br pros the cast members do the best they can with the lousy material some unintentional hilarity moves at a good pace should at 81 minutes br br cons awful writing which includes putrid dialogue and countless plot holes poorly lit especially the night scenes and the ending which you can't make out at all doesn't make a lick of sense badly scored cheap and very dated effects total lack of character development and you won't care about anybody this is supposed to be a horror film but it's lacking in that area and isn't the least bit scary nothing interesting or exciting happens loaded with unnecessary padding br br final thoughts i never expected this to be some forgotten gem but i never imagined it would be this bad i don't know if it's the worst film ever made but it's a definite contender troma should have let this film rot instead of giving it a release don't make the same mistake i did and let your curiosity get the best of you br br my rating 1 5
i usually don't comment anything i read the others opinions but this this one i have to comment i was convinced do watch this movie by worlds like action f 117 and other hi tech stuff but by only few first minutes and i changed my mind lousy acting lousy script and a big science fiction br br it's one of the worst movies i have ever seen br br simply don't bother br br and one more thing before any movie i usually check user comments and rating on this site 3 7 points and i give this movie a try now i'm wondering who rate this movie by giving it more than 2 points
okay but just plain dumb not bad for a horror comedy film i was reading how people switched it with the michael version and that is a good trick in my opinion because some grown ups hate horrors and when they see this one it will get them interested in horror films like this one or maybe never seen it the horror possibly comedy uncle sam i'll have to see about renting or buying that film but the 2nd is way better then this one but i bought this one on vhs of amazon and got it november 21 the day before thanksgiving worth the four bucks l o l at this film br br 9 10
in his 1966 film blow up antonioni had his hero question truth against a backdrop of british youth protesters by setting such questions against a fabric of hippie youth movements antonioni questioned intentionally or not the effectiveness of these organisations how can you fight for a cause when what you think is true may actually be a lie on the flip side the film said that we must fight and actively challenge what we see precisely because others may be deceiving us with false images and false truths though the hippie aspects were the most tacky parts of blow up they created a nice texture and gave the film more meaning than it might otherwise have had it was a very cautionary and mature little film br br with zabriskie point antonioni throws away all the ambiguities and subtleties of blow up and goes full blown hippie the result is a film awash with bad metaphors stupid ideas and heavy handed storytelling how could somebody who across his career displayed such restraint and intelligence make something so silly br br the film opens with a nice series of close ups as we watch a group of radicals discussing the meaning of revolution suddenly one man mark gets up and leaves he hates the rigid and ordered nature of revolution he recognises that though revolutionaries fight for freedom to bind oneself to such a militant cause is to effectively give your freedom away and so like jack nicholson in the passenger mark just wants to be free br br as such mark buys a gun and goes solo he takes orders from no one when police raid his university campus mark shoots a guy and runs away he then flees to a nearby airfield steals a small private plane and flies out to the desert antonioni treats the desert as a peaceful utopia and contrasts it with the ruthlessly capitalist cities with their billboards and hollow modern appliances he sees the desert as a sort of garden of eden br br in the desert mark meets daria and quickly falls in love antonioni then gives us a ridiculous sex scene in which hundreds of hippies have sex in the sand free from the constraints of modern life these tree huggers and student radicals can now celebrate their individualism by humping in the sun br br the film ends with mark dying and daria fantasising about blowing up the mansions and stately homes of the rich capitalists who killed him it's antonioni's challenge to his audience pick up the guns pickets and explosives he says tear the walls down before they cage you in br br of course the film had no effect on its audience they recognised zabriskie point as being just another self centred commercial attempt at being radical a sort of commodified radicalism it felt untruthful and tame br br thematically the film is pretty stupid antonioni basically says that if you are unhappy with the modern world and the fat cats who exploit you you should either flee to the desert mark or actively fight the system daria that's all well and good but though artists constantly warn us of such dystopian nightmares they're all mostly unable to show us how to effectively administer change like the end of fight club nihilism and violence achieve nothing in the real world social change tends to be instigated by humble inventors spurred ahead by minor technological advancements i mean what liberated women more than contraceptives br br 3 10 a very bad film the problem is antonioni does not really believe in rebellion he is a quiet and contemplative man an introvert who seems to have made an extroverted film simply to garner more adoration from the counterculture who embraced his earlier film blow up as such zabrinskie point comes across as a very pretentious and stupid film it's essentially a 50 year old man say look at me i'm a daring rebel br br there are many films in which the audience is encouraged to fight the system but they all fall into one of four categories in the first category you have films like network cool hand luke cuckoo's nest and spartacus these all show that the lives of freedom fighters all end in failure though in each case the spirit of revolution survives the message is that you can not effect change but by dying or failing the optimistic notion of change survives through martyrdom essentially we must keep on failing rather than give up hope br br then you have films like fight club zabriskie point and falling down which simply encourage you to explode tear it all down blow it all up everything is a lie so you might as well go out guns blazing these films are borne out of angry reactionary feelings rather than any sort of common sense br br then you have the flight rather than fight category terrence malick and antonioni are the masters of this genre films like the passenger red desert and badlands show human beings running from worlds they do not like and forging islands or peaceful havens for themselves both directors are pessimists in that malick has his islands destroyed and antonioni has his islands offering no sense of happiness or solution br br then you have the fourth category films like donnersmarck's the lives of others ashby's bound for glory and kubrick's a clockwork orange treat artists as a force of change and rebellion in these dystopian worlds in which everyone is content to be a slave to the state it is the unbridled creativity and freedom of will of the artist criminal who keeps the system in check by simply existing outside of the herd you create waves your comments actions and critical eye challenges the status quo as such donnersmarck's film has novelists and artists undermining nazi germany whilst kubrick has alex the artist criminal fighting nazi droogs painting the town in blood and sperm
this film exceeded my expectations i thought and have heard that it was going to be rubbish so i wasn't expecting much however i was pleasantly surprised at first i didn't take well to the lead girl and didn't really care if she lived or died after a while she definitely grew on me and became a likable character it's not just some slasher film where people die for no reason there is a background story that only takes a few seconds of the film but explains a lot i would recommend this film to everyone if you're not sure just watch it anyway it's only an hour and a half of your life you're going to live for 80 years anyway
with the current trend of gross out humor this film is the granddaddy of them all while some of the humor is dated every skit will either shock repulse or make you laugh out loud most memorable is the sex games commentary and of course the vd commercial it doesn't always work but pays off when it does i give this a 7
a very tired looking burt reynolds plays a mercenary battling his former employers for some gizmo these non heroes plan to sell to the iranians low rent video nonsense by the producers of silk stalkings offers some decent action footage and a lot of ineptly staged drama a lack of logic and truly dreadful dialogue are the defining aspects although the final twists and allegiance shifts could've been a nifty end to a better movie burt still has presence although it also means you notice more when he mouths insultingly half baked one liners
the first film ever made workers streaming from a factory some cycling most walking moving right or left along with melies the lumieres are both the starting point and the point of departure for cinema with melies begins narrative fiction cinema fantasy artifice spectacle with the lumieres pure unadorned observation the truth there are many intellectuals who regret the ossification of cinema from the latter into the tired formulae of the former br br but consider this short again there is nothing 'objective' about it the film is full of action a static inhuman scene burst into life activity and the quiet harmony of the frame is ruptured decentred from the back to right or left but never of course the front where the camera is and yet the camera stands stock still contains the energy the possible subversion subordinates it to its will the cinematograph may be a revolutionary invention but it will be used for conservative purposes to map out the world edit it restrict it limit it br br worse is the historical reality of the film these factory workers are lumiere employees the bosses are spying on their workers the unseen eye regarding his faceless minions the film therefore describes two types of imprisonment behind the gates the workers are confined in their workplace the opening of the gate seems to be an image of freedom escape but they face another wall the fourth wall further confining them the first film is also the first example of cctv surveillance an image of unseen all seeing authority entrapping its servants a frightening all too prophetic movie
very good martial arts film and jet li is the best since the master himself bruce lee li is excellent as the low key librarian cop who saves all time and time again he has a presence and a look that is riveting and believable as the kung fu king that you don't mess with francoise yip is simply beautiful in that mixed race original way that is unique because of her mixed heritage she has an innocence and an allure all at the same time that i found unforgettable the villain the man with the sunglasses and long hair was very good as well but i can't find his name in the credits can some one help me out with that thanks enjoy hak hap or black mask in any language its good entertainment
i saw brigadoon on tv last night 12 sept 2009 i am 61 years old and have been watching films as long as i can remember i can truthfully say that brigadoon stands alone as by far and away the worst film i have ever seen the accents were shameful the local children's club would have produced better sets the characters were so wooden that they probably contracted dry rot from the tears of the patrons who had the misfortune to watch them it is to be hoped that the stars of this film had hides thick enough to protect them from the embarrassment which they must have suffered on seeing this film the owners of this tripe should perform a great service to mankind and destroy all copies of this film
little edie and big edie are characters that anyone can feel compassion for even though their house was filthy this is somehow understandable considering their mental illness on the message board a poster wrote that little edie has the coping skills of an eight year old this reminded me of when in the dramatized 2009 version big edie says to little edie if you're stuck it's only with yourself these women had everything beauty talent intelligence firm belief in their opinions and actions perhaps if little edie wasn't so hard on herself the first time things didn't work out losing her hair her job and the love of her life she would have made it this somehow ties into what i believe is her mental illness her inability to pick herself up when times are hard and see that good times lie ahead the world will never know what have happened if she didn't listen to her mom's plea come home edie let me take care of you br br yet these understandably insecure women somehow manage to be brilliant heartbreaking and lovable even in their extremely filthy home these women were extraordinary and their interaction with each other bring humor and sadness when edie had one of her emotional breakdowns dwelling about what could have been or about how she wants to get out of her home because she feels like a little girl one gets the intense urge to hug her and tell her that everything will be okay br br great documentary br br 9 10
this was a favorite christmas special that i wish that they would release on vhs or dvd since my 33 rpm got lost and any cassettes i made are also long gone br br i am not even a big john denver fan but was very impressed with the music which was mostly traditional favorites with a muppet spin esp little st nick it also contained a few little known songs original br br even though it was done at the end of the '70's this show had a timeless feel to it hoping to find a copy soon
it's hard to imagine that anyone could find this short their favorite if they have seen most of their shorts but i know that humor is very subjective i have seen all of their sound shorts by far the best of their stuff imo and i found this one of their weaker efforts br br in the year this was made 1930 stan and babe made 15 shorts and one feature they were extremely popular and their boss hal roach took full advantage by keeping them working constantly in addition this was a time of experimentation for the writers and stan i would say this was an experiment that really did not work as someone else said it does not play to their strengths too much dialog and plot br br the best part of this one for me is the largely improvised sequence with stan as agnes the maid and the great thelma todd talking about girl stuff br br if you really want to see the boys at their most creative and funny check out blotto or brats from the same year br br they made so many shorts in such a short time that i think they can be forgiven for turning out a few less then par shorts they made something like 108 films altogether very few except for the ones made at fox were outright failures but there are some county hospital me and my pal the live ghost the fixer uppers come to mind as essentially weak ones but other then those i find something wonderful in just about all their shorts quite a record in my book br br if you have seen and enjoyed all their other shorts then by all means check this one out but i would be willing to bet that this one was less then memorable to stan and babe
coming shortly before the imposition of a morality code darkened the spirits of writers directors and actors the first film adaptation of w somerset maugham's of human bondage titillated countless moviegoers it has no shock value today just fine acting br br while the cast is excellent this is bette davis's first great role and one of leslie howard's best performances howard is english wannabe parisian artist philip carey who is gently and firmly told that he lacks any talent and that his dedication is no substitute for true genius taking the lesson to heart he returns to london and enrolls in a medical college one by the way that seems to have no female students at that time there would have been at least a few perhaps author physician maugham didn't care for distaff medicos br br having tea one day carey is entranced by a waitress mildred rogers bette davis in a role as a morally loose and basically wicked farrago her cockney accent is as sharp as eliza doolittle's his repeated attempts to date her are greeted with the less than enthusiastic reply i don't mind a sure sign for any man with his head screwed on straight that he's plumbing the depths maugham's mildred supplemented her waitress tips with a bit of old fashioned street walking something not clearly brought out here br br carey's besotted prostration serves rogers' avaricious need for support of the financial kind he is desperately in love with her she plays him as a sunday church organist effortlessly plies her instrument no sex here recognizing that he is getting nowhere he begins a chaste relationship with norah a woman who adores him re enter mildred replete with a baby and in her usual need of being taken care of exit heartbroken norah br br another separation from mildred and carey begins a long term friendship with sally abetted enthusiastically by her dad who seems to view eventual marriage as both a good thing for the two young people and a chance to be relieved of one of his nine offspring br br the movie reasonably but not entirely follows maugham's excellent novel howard's carey is naive and vulnerable and for much of the movie his sad eyes remind one of a doe facing a double barreled shotgun mildred is unrestrainedly wicked a user of the worst kind her sole preoccupation with her own needs barely disguised when she tries to wheedle carey with a thin patina of affectionate words and offers at one point she promises she'll do anything he wants a daring statement for the times and one i'm sure audiences fully understood br br pre code it may be but mildred's quick march dissolution would have satisfied the league of catholic decency the ending is conventional sin loses principled behavior triumphs br br director john cromwell wrought excellent performances from his two main stars one well established the other established largely because of this film the atmosphere is 1930s london and the trip back in time is worth taking br br available on dvd br br 9 10 for davis's and howard's performances
a rousing adventure form director george stevens before he would turn to more serious fare such as 1948's i remember mama and 1956's giant that set the standard for all future action yarns to follow loosely based on rudyard kipling's poem of the same gunga din follows the journey of three military officers in 19th century india the noble trio must brave a series of battles and other various dangers including a thuggee cult and a temple full of gold their screen adventures remain thrilling even after more than six decades and have lent inspiration to nearly everything from the cliffhanger inspired space opera star wars 1977 to the similarly plotted raiders of the lost arc 1981 br br the biggest reason for the picture's success however is the pitch perfect performances by the film's trio of extremely charismatic actors victor mclaglen has rarely been better as the strapping tough guy cary grant is the ultimate comic foil and douglas fairbanks jr is as suave a swashbuckling hero as imaginable perhaps even more so than rival errol flynn the chemistry between the three actors simply could not be improved upon and such warm and believable comradely is precisely what's missing from most modern action pictures and they receive tremendous support from the marvelous sam jaffe who overcomes the obvious physical miscasting and makes the title character a beacon of humane sweetness and quiet strength a huge hit in its day the film was reportedly the second biggest money maker of 1939 behind the outrageously successful gone with the wind and it remains arguably the best film of its kind
this movie is just horrible it's boring it's low quality the actors are just the worst actors i have ever seen and the scenario is so bad that it's hilarious br br the main actor is supposed to be the hot guy who gets all the girls but he's ugly overweight and looks like he's from the early 90's br br all the characters are away for the week end for a get together amongst friends but nobody are actually friends the married couple hasn't seen the main guy in over 5 years and even back then they weren't really friends the date of the main guy only knows him from work and than there's a girl they pick up at a bar now tell me that you would risk losing your job to spend a week end at your cabin with people that aren't even your real friends because that's what he does at the beginning of the movie br br do not waste even one minute of your time on this lemon i've made home movies scarier than this br br
i saw this in a sneak two days before the official opening and i must say i was extremely disappointed and i have to put the majority of these problems on the decision to cast claire danes in the lead role depending on what you think about danes she was either horribly miscast or is so far in over her head that she should be the early favorite for the 2007 razzie for worst actress i think we were supposed to be sympathetic to her instead she is completely unlikeable the other great actresses do an ok job but certainly don't light up the screen out of all the great actresses in this movie i'd say the one who did the best job was natasha richardson streep is barely in the picture and only appears near the very end br br horrible screenplay as well it comes off more as them reading lines than truly being in character
with the advent of the imdb this overlooked movie can now find an interested audience why because users here who do a search on two time academy award winner glenda jackson can find 'the return of the soldier' among her credits so can those checking out oscar winner julie christie fans of ann margret can give the title a click as will those looking into the career of the great alan bates not to mention the added bonus of a movie with supporting heavyweights ian holm and frank finlay any movie with so many notables in it is rewarded by the imdb given all the cross referencing that goes on here so why isn't this movie out on dvd don't the producers realize the internet movie database is a marketing gift for such a film and 'the return of the soldier' is definitely a gem waiting to be discovered get with it people
there's nothing worse than renting an asian movie and getting an american movie experience instead br br it's only my opinion but a good thriller is dependent upon the establishment of likable intelligent characters as far as likability is concerned the protagonists in say yes are a quaint married couple nicely done unfortunately they are stupid beyond belief let us count the ways they mishandle being terrorized by a stalker br br 1 after a hitchhiker threatens to kill you be sure to tell him what hotel you're staying at when you drop him off br br 2 beat the hell out of the stalker in broad daylight and in front of dozens of witnesses thereby allowing him to press charges of assault br br 3 don't bother telling the police about the stalker and simply assume for no apparently good reason that the cops were bribed by him br br 4 while trying to escape let your lady out of your sight as much as possible to ensure that the stalker kidnaps her br br 5 after getting help from someone to find the stalker after kidnapping your wife be sure to send them away as soon as possible so you can face him one on one no point in being unfair right br br now i'd never expect that any person would be immune to making a few mistakes under these stressful conditions but the characters in say yes are so dense and make so many unbelievable mistakes that it's effectively impossible for the viewer to care about their safety since they are victims of their own doing this kills the enjoyability of the entire film br br in case you were wondering the scriptwriters didn't stop with dim witted characters since they themselves are surely dim witted for writing this crapfest they decided to make situations so absurdly unrealistic that all sense of reality goes out the window br br 1 the stalker kills a cop inside a police station  while the protagonist is asleep no more than ten feet away br br 2 the stalker engages in all sorts of dubious activities in broad daylight and around tons of people yet no one other than the married couple seems to notice his odd behavior br br 3 the stalker survives an absurd amount of violence that would have killed any human being br br 4 the suspense scenes had no imagination whatsoever in fact some scenes were direct rip offs from american movies br br the only positive is the decapitation near the end which was a pretty brutal scene since it was inflicted upon the wife it's too bad the filmmakers followed it up with an outrageously stupid ending that comes out of left field br br truly the koreans behind the making of say yes should be ashamed of themselves better yet they should just move to california and take employment with people who make movies with a similar disregard for quality and intelligence
this movie is even a big step down form the typical fare dished out by bollywood the performances were horrible even boman irani who always manages to shine goes completely ott as the villain the soundtrack is not memorable either and in spite trying hard the female leads don't manage to be sexy vivek oberoi is capable of far better projects while fardeen khan seems to be stuck in similar fare for the time being but this monstrosity is even beneath his limited capabilities as an actor esha deol and amrita rao are horrible in badly written cliché roles it's high time for indra kumar to hang up his directorial hat hope he never directs another eyesore like this future of hindi movies are in better hands now to sum it up stay far away from waste of celluloid
2 stars for kay francis she's wonderful and she didn't deserve this horrible tripe that warner bros threw her way br br the two pronged premise that this movie is based on is ridiculous and unbelievable in the extreme kay is a small town wife and mother who yearns for something bigger she wants to be an actress when a big shot actor comes to town and invites kay to his hotel to talk about possibilities kay tells her husband she's going to the movies the hubby's biddy of a mother puts a bug in hubby's ear that kay's not being truthful and he sets out looking for her he finds her w the actor in the hotel they are only talking and he slugs the guy who falls over a railing lands face first in a pond lake and dies now here's the two unbelievable premises upon which the rest of the movie is based br br 1 the judge tells the jury that if it's determined that the man died before his head went into the water that they must find the hubby guilty of first degree murder whaaaaa i think slugging a guy in a fit of rage would count for manslaughter or murder 2 at the most not first degree murder give me a break but the plot required him being found guilty of murder 1 so that he could be sent to prison for life whatever br br 2 the hubby's lawyer after the conviction and sentencing tells kay that it's all her fault his reasoning is that if she hadn't gone over to the actor's room then her husband wouldn't have had to go after her and slug the guy and kill him he tells her that she's the guilty one not her husband and she nods and agrees what the hell the rest of the movie is all about kay trying to achieve fame and money in order to get her husband released from prison and right the wrong she committed by causing him to kill the actor dude in the first place br br i can't even go on with this review the movie was just all too painful four years earlier in the pre code days you'd never have caught kay playing such a wimp in true kay francis fashion though she did do her best to make us believe that this woman was a believable character i give her much credit for trying to breathe some life and credibility to this thankless role this character was a far cry from pre code kay roles and real life spitfire kay francis br br steer way clear of this one there are much better kay francis vehicles out there from personal experience i can highly recommend mary stevens md and jewel robbery also good are dr monica and one way passage i'm sure there's other great kay flicks as well but i'm only mentioning the ones i've seen and can recommend
i have loved this book since my 5th grade teacher read it to our class many years ago and i have read it to every one of my 3rd and 5th grade classes over my past 18 years of teaching supposedly a movie had been made in the past but i'd never been able to locate it well my students and i were all so excited when we heard that disney had brought madeline l'engle's excellent book to the screen br br as i watched the movie i had the highest of hopes as the film went on i became more and more despondent they had botched it badly never had i been so let down by a favorite book to film adaption i understand that films can't stick strictly to a book but they don't need to change things for the sake of it most if not all of departures from the book were totally unnecessary br br i kept my opinion to myself at first and just listened to my students discuss the movie well it wasn't just me nearly every single one felt the same way cheated out of the great story that madeline l'engle had so skillfully created br br why they wondered did aunt beast look like chewbacca from the star wars movie why couldn't calvin's hair have been red why did mrs which not have the proper witch like outfit that was such a clever play on her name basically we all wondered why did nearly every single detail have to be changed br br i have always dreamed of how wonderful a movie this book would make i am still waiting for that movie this one was a wrinkle in time in only the broadest of senses i'm going to write to peter jackson and try to convince him to take on the task
somebody owes ang lee an apology actually a lot of people do and i'll start i was never interested in the ang lee film hulk because of the near unanimous bad reviews even the premium cable channels seemed to rarely show it i finally decided to watch it yesterday on usa network and wow br br spoilers for ang lee's hulk and the incredible hulk br br was it boring i almost didn't make it through ang lee's hulk eric bana was expressionless nick nolte was horrible sam elliott was unlikeable and that's no fun he's usually a cool character in fact i honestly think they chose eric bana because his non descript face was the easiest to mimic with computer graphics and it was clear that the ang lee hulk was meant to facially resemble bruce banner in his non angry state when hulk fought a mutant poodle i was ready to concede hulk as the worst superhero movie ever br br but then something happened about 3 4 of the way through this tedious movie there was a genuinely exciting and dare i say it reasonably convincing extended action scene that starts with hulk breaking out of a containment chamber in a military base fighting m1 tanks and comanche helicopters in the desert then riding an f22 raptor into the stratosphere only to be captured on the streets of san francisco this was one of the best action sequences ever made for a superhero movie and i have to say the cgi was quite good that's not to say that the hulk was totally convincing but it didn't require much more suspension of disbelief than is required in a lot of non superhero action movies and that's quite a feat br br of course the ending got really stupid with bruce banner's father turning into some sort of shape shifting villain but the earlier long action sequence put any of iron man's brief heroics to shame and overall apart from the animated mutant dogs it really did seem like the cgi in hulk tried hard to convince you that he was real and really interacting with his environment it was certainly better than i expected br br ok but what about the incredible hulk guess what it's boring too it has just a few appearances by the hulk and here's the thing the cgi in this movie is horrible maybe the hulk in ang lee's version looked fake at times and cartoonish at others but it had its convincing moments also the incredible hulk looked positively ridiculous it had skin tone and muscle tone that didn't even look like a living creature just some sort of computer generated texture it was really preposterous the lighting environment and facial effects didn't look 5 years newer than ang lee's they looked 10 years older and there really is no excuse for that we truly are living in an era where computer programmers can ruin a movie just as thoroughly as any director actor or cinematographer ever could br br worse the writer and director of this movie seemed to learn almost nothing from ang lee's failure all the same mistakes are made bruce banner is practically emotionless the general is so relentlessly implausibly one dimensional that he seems faker than the hulk the love interest is unconvincing i have to give liv tyler credit for being more emotional than jennifer connelly though both are quite easy on the eyes tim blake nelson overacts almost as much as nick nolte even though he's only in the movie for a few minutes the hulk really doesn't do much in this movie certainly not any more than in ang lee's version the incredible hulk was slightly more fast paced but since nothing really happened anyway that's not worth much oh yeah the villain is every bit as phony looking as the hulk he's actually much more interesting as a human than as a monster br br this is how i can definitively say ang lee's version was better if i ever have the chance to see ang lee's version again i might be able to sit through it to see the good action sequences or else to try to appreciate the dialogue a little more more likely i'd just fast forward to the good parts but there is absolutely not a single scene in the incredible hulk that is worth seeing once let alone twice it is truly at the bottom of the heap of superhero movies the cartoonish cgi is an insult to the audience at least in ang lee's version it seems like they were trying to make it realistic except for the giant poodle of course br br it is absolutely mind boggling how the filmmakers intended to erase the bad feelings associated with ang lee's hulk by making almost exactly the same movie br br it is to edward norton's credit that he seems to be distancing himself from this film
so i rented still crazy instead when i described hardcore logo to the guy at the video store he said that sounded kind of like still crazy so i rented it was i disappointed well yes as still crazy focuses on a classic rock band rather than a punk band but that's ok still crazy tells the story of the strange fruit a rock band that broke up in the 70s at the peak of their popularity at a large rock festival twenty years later the band members are all struggling to make a living and are offered the opportunity to play a concert at the twenty year anniversary of this festival they take up the offer and decide to reform on a permanent basis touring europe in the process some quite funny hijinks ensue and all the characters go through subtle changes watching this movie you feel more like a viewer of a carefully edited documentary than a participant and that's not bad at all
i feel like i've been had the con is on don't fall for it after reading glowing reviews the director was a film reviewer with sky for years so must have a lot of mates in the press ready to do him a favour by writing favorable reviews i expected solid acting atmosphere suspense strong characterization an intriguing plot development and poetic moments sadly 'sixteen years of alcohol' doesn't deliver on the critics promises for the most part sacrifices these qualities in lieu of cheesy low budget special effects what was that clichéd cobweb scene in there for unrealistic fight choreography and mindless mind numbing narration cliché edits and camera angles br br 'sixteen years of alcohol' starts off interestingly with some beautiful location shots in scotland but it's straight downhill from here unfortunately instead of spending some time building atmosphere creating characters we might care about or building suspense the director opts to begin driving you crazy with self indulgent heavy handed twaddle voice over's the lead characters are so unsympathetic and are so badly acted the audience doesn't care what happens to them desperate actors do desperate things like this movie to make matters worse the 'homage's' typical of a director trying to pay his dues to past masters are either utterly cliché or unconvincing the soundtrack is the only thing that lifted me and kept me in the cinema but even that failed to support the dramatic narrative other connecting a period of time to the action br br for some reason the movie got increasingly flawed and to be quite honest annoying i still watched the whole damn thing br br i guess i liked the attempt at gritty realism in the film but even that was destroyed when they were often inter cut with weird and abstract sometimes pointless scenes you don't need a huge budget to make truly moving film so much has been said about how little money they had to make this film half a million is not a little bit of money so no excuses sometimes i wonder what the actors or their agents were thinking br br pass on this turkey unless you're masochistic or mindless anyway not my thing br br 1 5 10
this movie is a great way for the series to finally end peter the boy from puppet master iii is all grown up and is now the puppet master well this girl comes to destroy the puppets and learn toulon's secrets but instead she listens to the story about the puppets most of this movie is footage from puppet master ii puppet master iii puppet master 4 puppet master 5 curse of the puppet master and retro puppet master sorry but i guess paramount wouldn't let them use scenes from 1 personally i wish puppet master vs demonic toys would finally be made but the way this movie ends they basically say this is the final movie in the series
ok for starters taxi driver is amazing this this is not taxi driver or amazing what it is is bad but i thought it was bad funny which means that it did have some redeeming qualities like the dialogue wow there was more or less no plot the characters were all stupid and the movie was preachy there were some places were i thought the movie would dive into taxi driver type violence which would have hit the message at the end of the movie on the head much harder i can't even believe that there are like 20 other people who have seen this movie yeah it's worth watching if you are real bored and you want to reaffirm the fact that anyone can make a movie or at least can try to
well when before i saw this film i really wasn't sure whether it would be my cup of tea how wrong i was i thought that this was one of the best films i've watched for a very long time a real family classic the story of a young evacuee and his new 'foster' dad this film ticks all the boxes i've not read the book maybe that's a good thing meant i enjoyed the film more but with regards to the story i really can't think of any bad points hence scoring it 10 out of 10 and i hardly ever think anything warrants top marks by the time william proclaimed 'i can ride my bike dad ' i was sobbing my heart out anyone who's seen it will understand i'm sure really heartwarming and definitely recommended
cinema is dead long live the cinema said peter greenaway one of the most innovative and productive contemporary directors at the last year's romanian film festival anonimul which got to the third edition and takes place in the danube delta this year the direction prize went to jafar panahi's offside i got to see it this evening in bucharest at the festival's retrospective cinema is dead but still very lively panahi's film tells in a compelling manner how iranian society looks digitally filmed offside is a story inspired by a real life event happened to panahi's daughter the trouble and risk took when decided to attend a football match this is forbidden in iran as we are informed what panahi manages to do is to render with few means but with probably a lot of work intelligence and humor the cultural patterns in a society that places women at a distinct level the absurdity of the laws becomes comical the film has a happy end after all because iran's team goes to the world cup what i appreciated most was the concept the idea behind this film i would be very interested to see panahi's other films that were forbidden in iran as well i guess that he can be thought as an activist director
rip off of scream or especially i know what you did last summer there's some entertainment here and a little scary but they needed some originality br br an entertainment score 6 5 10 overall 5 5 10
watching before the devil counts as one of my all time best experiences at the cinema i have been intrigued my the mixed response to the film and for me the extremes of opinion indicate the film touched on something either embraced or disavowed by the general audience it is one of those films that has stayed with me and i continue to ponder and think about it br br surely the dvd would illuminate some more of the themes and the film making elements which include sidney lumet's comeback movie the time shifting technique deployed in the storytelling the superb combination of lumet and masterson and why it works so well the masterly direction the relatively rare focus hollywood movies give to male characters and their largely doomed struggle to become an open cheque book for their women the under presented but nevertheless resonant marisa tomei's performance and of course the superb hoffman with that central monologue about the sum of his parts for me the heart of the movie br br phew surely a masterful film so imagine my disappointment watching the eagerly anticipated dvd only to find no commentary no behind the scenes no interviews no extras br br hey distributors sort it out
this is one of the all time great our gang shorts spanky is at his very cutest and funniest and the babies that he get's left to babysit are also hilarious tiny spanky is coerced by the gang into watching all their little siblings the opening shot of them all in baby carriages being entertained by various things hung by the gang from fishing poles is a beautiful gag br br spanky's appearance wearing his huge toy knife when asked to babysit by the older fellows is priceless as is his response hey where do you get that stuff i don't take care of no babies the tiny fellow saying remarkable throughout the film all the beautiful sight gags and spanky telling the babies all about tarzan add up to make this one of the best our gang 's you'll ever see
directed by brian de palma and written by oliver stone scarface is a movie that will not be forgotten a cuban refugee named tony montana pacino comes to america for the american dream montana then becomes the king in the drug world as he ruthlessly runs his empire of crime in miami florida this gangster movie is very violent and some scenes are unpleasant to watch this movie has around 180 f words and is almost three hours long this movie is entertaining and you will never get bored you cheer for the drug lord and in some scenes you find out that montana isn't as evil as some other crime lords this is a masterpiece and i recommend that you see this you will not be disappointed 9 10
this is one of the worst action films i have ever seen this is particularly due to much of the factual implausibility like an obvious agent posing as a bank loan officer while making obvious that he is speaking to someone through a wire or the scene where the scientists assume it is safe to enter a room in which a virus has been released even though 'it has not found a viable host' does not mean that it will never find one the cheap sets the bank looks like it was poorly constructed to resemble a dungeon and the bad acting it is the story of an organized crime group that has successfully stolen a capsule of the lethal virus however the head honcho who decides to remove it from a bank security deposit box does so at the same time a bank heist is going down at the same fbi agents have been informed of this and at the same time a terrible earthquake erupts needless to say the aftermath of the quake is messy in more ways than one however the results do not make for an enticing action film but instead one that has been obviously z grade junk from the beginning of the film perhaps this is why some of the screen captures on the packaging look to be created with computer graphics rather than being actual screen captures from various sequences of the film what the hell ron perlman was doing in this i have no idea i wonder if he was as embarrassed to be in it as i was to have watched it
nominated for the oscar worst script ever in my opinion there's no decent story rediculous acting very lousy humor by every means possible if you have little self respect please don't waste your time seeing this movie although u can see the actors can act it leaves you dumber after watching it precious braincells are being killed watching this crap br br i warned u br br don't see this movie
i first saw this at a foreign film festival it's a beautifully paced nail biter about a plot to relieve the estonian treasury of a billion or so in gold it's all shot in a gritty grainy style that hollywood rarely uses but it captures the atmosphere of the newly emancipated baltic states beautifully note tallin was actually looking a lot less grim in 2003 when i was there br br there's a lot of humor and some romance too i don't want to spoil a number of startling yet logical surprises so i'll just say this heist film starts from a great script and the directing and performances are top notch darkness in tallin is simply the fastest and most nerve racking example of its genre i'd put it up against rafifi topkapi and it's miles ahead of the new ocean's 11 though deliberately not as glossy rent or buy it now
i turn on 700 club once in awhile and only agree with some of the statements made i'm one of many believers that is considered liberal by most christians and conservative by most non christians i vote my mind and its usually not rep or dem i don't believe 700 club tells people what to believe but that it represents many older christians that grew up in very conservative backgrounds i think many folks misunderstand what is said on 700 club it bums me out to hear name calling either direction i think 700 club folks really do love jesus but are so busy trying to get people to vote conservatively that they've forgotten to show love to certain people and promote peace like jesus did please don't judge jesus based on ignorant individuals that believe on him and let's also not be as ignorant with our comments about them why are people so mean to each other
it has singing it has drama it has comedy it has a story it's one of the greatest movies ever made period if you can't enjoy this movie then you must be either asleep or in some kind of mental disarray in yankee doodle dandy james cagney sings and dances his way to an academy award but in this movie he is better this is james cagney at his quisessential best he's fast with the one liners he's fast with his feet it's nonstop action and the song and dance skits are classics especially shanghai lil and the supporting cast is great and the entire movie is upbeat fast moving and exudes confidence and even though this movie was made over 70 years ago it's still watchable even today and of course this movie features miss ruby keeler who was married to al jolson she is the perfect partner for james cagney and dick powell too if you like upbeat fast paced movies with lots of singing and dancing this is the movie to watch
i've seen this about 2 or 3 times and haven't regretted it homeward bound is not just a typical animal movie its unique fun and bursting with adventure the things that make it a fun movie are the animals obvious who are wonderfully trained a very good effort br br 8 5 10
the first film was a nice one but it is not as good as the wonderful animated classic which i found more poignant and endearing this sequel is inferior but not bad at all sure the slapstick is too much the script has its weak spots and the plot is a tad uninspired but the dogs are very cute here and eric idle is hilarious as the macaw the film is nice to look at with stylish cinematography and eye popping costumes especially cruella's and the music is pleasant the acting is mostly very good ioan gruffudd is appealing and gerard depardieu while he has given better performances has fun as cruella's accomplice but the best asset as it was with the first film is the amazing glenn close in a deliciously over the top performance as cruella even more evil than she was previously overall nice 7 10 bethany cox
just watched this after my mother brought it back from america for me was dreading watching this after all the negative comments on here but i have to say yes the acting is cheesy some of the effects are laughable br br but you have to remember this was meant to be 1898 not 2005 and for such a low budget i thought it was quite good i enjoyed this version much more then the spielberg version i saw last week br br i have read the book so many times and found myself going ahh yes that's in the book almost all the time with the other version hardly anything of the book existed br br so well done for at least trying to make a true version
everything in this film is bad the story the acting the effects but its funny funny funny scott valentine with the army uniform thats ten sizes too big is so bad with the permanent attempt at a scowl on his face as the leader of a special ops group its hilarious the ''terrorists'' are as scary and realistic as the ''raptors'' this is so phoney and bad at everything it tries you have to laugh the part where the giant t rex who somehow snuck on board a ship and then somehow got below is blown up and you see the metal pole sticking up where its head was is the perfect ending if your into bad films this is the pot of gold the mona lisa of b b bad
everything is idyllic in suburbia when the little family moves in as the father have got a new job in a computer company there but no paradise would be complete without its snake strange things happens as the family joins the local country club without the husband as it certainly holds secrets the father is not a joiner but pressure is on him to join as everyone who is anything in the neighborhood and at work are members robert urich's good guy part is a bit tepid but joanna cassidy as good natured housewife turning nasty sizzles suspenseful and well made chiller with a bitchy susan lucci as club chairperson look out for cult favorite michael berryman in a bit part as a valet the movie captures the sense of paranoia and the special effects final is worth waiting for i have seen this movie quite a few times
spoilers maybe a few details but nothing too plot related not like it would matter with this movie br br air rage blatantly rips off the mid air infiltration premise of executive decision ice t leads a team of four elite commandos who wear baggy black shirts that we can only imagine must conceal invisible body armor as their idiotic tactics similar to what 3rd graders use when playing star wars on the playground lead them to absorb a hail of gunfire br br what entertained me the most about this flick was the use of look alike has been actors you'll immediately recognize cyril o'reily as someone who once acted in a movie that you really liked though it was so long ago that you probably won't be able to place it it was porky's here cyril plays a decent knock off of a bill paxton character most hilarious is porker gil gerard who's so fat that you will never recognize him as tv's buck rogers instead of evoking his mildly heroic character past gerard gives us a passable performance of the crusty fat tough guy persona which was clearly imagineered for john goodman finally alex cord gives us a nice hybrid look alike performance as a chuck connors kirk douglas type in the 10 years since new jack city ice t's acting has deteriorated remarkably it's not acting so much as regurgitation of lines that he might have actually memorized br br one of the items that plays into this movie is a cd rom of classified information it's being hand carried and it's apparently and unbelievably not encrypted despite the security savvy aura of gerard's nsa character what a joke i'm severely doubting that the information purported to be on the cd would ever even all be assembled into a portable format br br despite being in a closed aircraft without silencers the gunfire is about as loud as canned air and causes nary a person to flinch so apparently no foley budget the assortment of weapons chosen is pretty funny the flight attendant's use of a coffee pot is about the most realistic depiction of violence in the film when she takes intuitively to the mini uzi pistol which has got to be one of the worst pistol designs ever that's just too stupid a true elite team would carry mp 5s for this type thing or maybe socomm 45s or even customized hi powers if they were really old school or maybe something fn 5 7 if new school the lame o standard issue 92fs are totally unbelievable having lost most of their cool after lethal weapon i the bad guys supposedly experienced soldier of fortune types have an assorted mixture of absurdity like the aforementioned mini uzi pistol and a tec 9 with the infamous non functional barrel extender that isn't a silencer br br there was one touch of realism on which i would like to correct the other reviewers the flight attendant and ice t did lower the craft to 10 000 feet for breathable air before they opened the door and i also got the impression that the flight attendant was not able to get the door closed that she basically just gave up on that point as far as the landing there was no mention of flaps until about 2 seconds before touchdown sigh br br only the dukes of hazard eluding roscoe p coltrane at the pass could shame this movie for use of stock footage they obviously chose the incredible and retired sr 71 because they couldn't get stock of an f 117 aside from the fact that they were mothballed already in 2001 let's also forget for a moment that the sr 71 is not a pure stealth aircraft in the sense of the b 2 and that at point blank range well i'm no expert but i'm having doubts as to whether it would be invisible on radar br br as others have pointed out the repeated references to f 15s when they were showing f 16s was laughable details of the 747 were pretty stupid no airline would put that few passengers on a 747 to begin with not to mention everything else that was idiotic about it pay attention to the use of exposed electrical wiring br br wow what a show catch it on stars or something don't pay to rent it but do watch it for laughs in contention for worst movie ever right up there with no holds barred which at least had some originality
sleepwalkers are creatures who drain the life force completely out of humans to survive but they can only use virgins it's not explained why charles brady brian krause is one such who needs to feed his mother mary alice krige he goes after likable tanya madchen amick will she escape br br on one hand this is a great horror film fast paced plenty of blood and gore and a nice twisted sense of humor there are plenty of in joke references for horror buffs castle rock is mentioned once also krause is excellent who would have thought he could act after return to the blue lagoon as is kirge and amick but i find this film annoying br br it was written for the screen by stephen king and it's maddeningly vague the sleepwalkers are never fully explained where are they from why are they called that why does the son have to feed the mother why do cats hate them and can kill them what are their powers after all at one point krause makes a car disappear and change color and style why do they need to feed off peoples' life force why does it have to be only virgins why is the son having sex with his mom none of these are explained leaving the story confusing it's really too bad because those questions aside this is an excellent horror film excellent makeup and special effects too br br fast gory and lots of fun if only the script were better also a fairly explicit sex scene between krause and krige was edited you can tell to get an r rating i can only give this a 7

i saw a preview of freebird at the isle of man tt as i had heard about it in a couple of motorcycle mags although i was over mainly for the racing the lure of seeing phil daniels in a motorcycle movie yes i love quadrophenia like everyone else proved enough to get me away from the beer and partying at last we've done it us british have actually made a great motorcycle film and no it's not like torque this is up there with the best of british comedy mark my words this is phil daniels best screen performance and as far as geoff bell is concerned there's a new british legend making his name felt i loved gary stretch in shane meadows' fantastic dead mans shoes and here he gives a quietly touching performance that he can proudly add to his growing film reputation this is a film not just for us bikers but i think for everyone even my girlfriend loved it i hope it gets the same brilliant response on the mainland as it got at the isle of man i'm not going to go into the details of certain classic scenes that this movie has watch out for the shop as it would spoil the fun but i would say go see enjoy and have one of the best nights in the cinema you've had in a while i really think this could well be a cult classic as they were saying at the tt c'mon freebird
i just want to start by saying this is the first review of a film i have done on the net i felt the need to warn people about this film because it truly is one of the worst films i have ever seen after reading interviews with the director he says he respects constructive criticism and so i will try to avoid bashing the film just for the sake of it and offer my opinions as to why i found it to be so catastrophically terrible br br 1 the actors i know the budget may not have allowed for great thespians but with nicholson working in the industry for over ten years surely he knew some actors who were at least average br br 2 the incredibly lame make up and special effects once again budget obviously interfered with what was originally intended but after working in make up for so many years there is really no excuse br br 3 the obvious similarities to hostel whilst not being exactly a rip off it sure does try to cash in on the former films success only problem is roth knew where he was going and exactly how to get there br br 4 the music not at all creepy or haunting not even sickening just plain annoying br br 5 the script in general all dialogue was forced and terrible also the sub plots about the theatre and the guy who comes in to save them were weak as and almost like an afterthought br br 6 the editing wtf how jarring and not in a good way nuf said br br seriously i would like to hear the director's thoughts on my post he no doubt frequents his pages on imdb cause buddy what were you thinking surely at some point during either the shooting or editing you realised what a turkey yolu had on your hands sorry i don't want to be harsh but you must have more talent than this i hope your next feature that gutterballs movie or wahtever is better hopefully practice makes progress br br but in the mean time avoid this like the plague i want my 81 mins back with interest at least i didn't pay to watch it
a first time director bromell has assembled a small but powerful cast to look at the world of a middle aged middle class depressed hit man and his struggle with his relationship with his father this film in less than 90 minutes presents an incredibly interesting contrast in human nature david dorfman as the 6 year old son of william h macy is the most refreshing little actor i've seen in awhile macy is brilliant in a part that almost seems written for him as a self tortured sole struggling to break the reins of his father and his business it's always great to see donald sutherland and here he's wonderful as the callous father of macy the films alternate audio track is well worth it to hear the director explain how he picked the cast locations and filmed the movie the basic dolby 2 channel sound is adequate for this film and well recorded the cinematography creates the mood along with a very subtle musical background any film buff or observer of human nature will enjoy this one especially if he's a fan of contradiction
this along with hare tonic ranks as one of the best bugs cartoons indeed one of the best bugs ever there are some comments about how bugs in these cartoons is basic meaning i guess that he is as yet not fully developed i actually prefer this basic version from the mid 40s chuck jones' was the best version who is actually more rabbit sized and far more amusing than the eventual long legged version who towered over yosemite sam and daffy duck the latter day bugs came to be too suave and sophisticated for my liking also check out hair raising hare 1946 and rabbit punch 1948 for great examples of classic bugs and classic chuck jones
first off anyone looking for meaningful outcome oriented cinema that packs some sort of social message with meaningful performances and soul searching dialog spoken by dedicated emotive heartfelt thespians please leave now you are wasting your time and life is short go see the new brangelina jolie movie have a good cry go out buy a hybrid car or throw away your conflict diamonds if that will make you feel better and leave us alone br br don't let the door hit you on the way out either the incredible melting man is a grade b minus regional horror epic shot in the wastelands of oklahoma by a young tv friendly cast crew and concerns itself with an astronaut who is exposed to bizarre radiation effects wakes up in a hospital and finds that his body is liquefying on him as he sits there feeling like a chump the melting man is played by one alex rebar who is recognizable for about the first four minutes of the film but once he starts oozin' with rick baker's extraordinary special effects makeup he more resembles something you might find in a tin of spam before you drain off all the runny viscous blebs of grease br br the film has zero exposition and does not bandy about with plot points there are a couple of scenes involving scientist types riding around on an absurd industrial conveyor machine who dutifully recite a few obligatory lines about the effects of radiation but the movie does not care really it's a freak show and a marvelous one at that with a decidedly sick sense of humor for those who can stomach it one great laugh comes when the melting man stumbles upon a young girl in the forest and is so at a loss for what to do that one of his eyes pops out hilarious br br the hero of the film is played by burr debenning a fascinating character actor from the golden 1970s 80s television scene who was sort of an early model for the kevin spacey prototype slightly twisted neurotic and one step ahead of most everyone in the room even if he looks confused he appeared just after this movie was made in a bizarre made for tv anthology horror piece called house of the dead or the alien zone that is regarded as one of the finest movies ever made in oklahoma which is where i suspect this film was made as well the arid cold looking rural midwestern landscapes are certainly the same and the creek that one unfortunate fly fisher chooses for his afternoon of sport appears to be the same one that cameron mitchell fought off flying alien pancakes in without warning which also had a sick sense of humor a tv friendly cast and some pretty outrageous gore i definitely sense at least an aesthetic connection between the three movies as well as the silence of the lambs which is of no surprise considering that director jonathan demme is a part of melting man's cast br br essentially as others have pointed out this is a 1950s b movie plot updated for later 1970s era special effects the inevitable boobs the movie it probably borrows most of it's ideas from is phantom from space with peter graves as an astronaut who also returns to earth after being exposed to funky radiation effects that set him off on a killing spree one of the things that i actually admire about the film is that absolutely no regard is given for the melting man's motivations he simply goes on a rampage and the movie's drama comes from wondering if he's going to fall to pieces before certain characters fall victim to his madness the budget for the film is also delightfully low and every dime spent on it is up there on the screen rick baker's disgusting effects getting the lion's share of whatever was spent on this br br sick disgusting fun best enjoyed with a crowd of friends and plenty of beer why can't people have made more movies like these br br 8 10
i have seen the freebird movie and think its great its laid back fun about time the british film industry came through with something entertaining its good how the guy who met them at the service station gets mentioned way into the film in the news agents nice touch the acting was convincing i am a biker they reminded me of some good times i have had in the bike scene it was good to see the film director getting in on the acting well done jon at the end a new crop gets mentioned in ireland is this the foundation for a 2nd film hope so keep them coming great film well written realistic characters
this is a great movie i love it more each time i watch most comedies can get pretty lame because you know all the gags but mystery men has so much integrity in the writing and characterization that watching once again as ben stiller tears at the hood ornament of the limo or hank azaria says good bye to louise lasser or geoffrey rush flashes his fuhrer choreography or tom waits mumbles while he watches the news report or janeane garofalo refuses a kiss from paul reubens is a pleasure this is pitch perfect ensemble acting the story develops directly and consistently the action sequences are creative and not too dominant all the set ups payoff by the end seriously if you've seen it and it's been a while watch it again and if you haven't then get started you can't watch it again until you've seen it the first time wes studi william h macy the tryouts scene too much good stuff
absolutely one of the worst movies of all time br br low production values terrible story idea bad script lackluster acting and i can't even come up with an adjective suitably descriptive for how poor joan river's directing is i know that there's a special place in hell for the people who financed this film prolly right below the level reserved for child raping genocidal maniacs br br this movie is a trainwreck br br terrible x infinity rabbit test br br avoid this at all costs br br it's so bad it isn't even funny how bad it is
when george c scott played the title role in patton you saw him directing tanks with pumps of his fist shooting at german dive bombers with a revolver and spewing profanity at superiors and subordinates alike the most action we get from gregory peck as macarthur a figure from the same war of debatably greater accomplishment is when he taps mapboards with his finger and raises that famous eyebrow of his br br comparing peck's performance with scott's may be unfair yet the fact macarthur was made by the same producer and scored by the same composer begs parallels as does the fact both films open with the generals addressing cadets at west point it's clear to me the filmmakers were looking to mimic that oscar winning film of a few years before but while peck looks the part more than scott ever did he comes off as mostly bland in a story that feels less like drama than a wikipedia walkthrough of macarthur's later career br br to this day there are those who think he was a dangerous demagogue and others who say he was one of the greatest men who ever lived an opening title crawl tells us it's a typical dishwater bit of post vietnam sophistry about those who led america's military very much of its time but what we get here is neither view macarthur as presented here doesn't anger or inspire the way he did in life br br director joseph sargent who went on to helm the famous turkey jaws the revenge does a paint by numbers job with bland battle montages and some obvious set use as when the chinese attack u s forces in korea while the script by hal barwood and matthew robbins trots out a macarthur who comes across as good natured to the point of blandness a bit too caught up in his public image but never less than decent br br here you see him stepping off the landing craft making his return to the phillipines there you see him addressing congress in his old soldiers never die speech for a long stretch of time he sits in a movie theater in toyko waiting for the north koreans to cross the 38th parallel so we can get on with the story while newsreel footage details japan's rise from the ashes under his enlightened rule peck's co actors marj dusay as his devoted wife you're my finest soldier and nicolas coaster as a loyal aide burnish teary eyes in the direction of their companion's magnificence but garner no interest on their own br br even when he argues with others peck never raises his voice and for the most part wins his arguments with thunderous eloquence when admiral nimitz suggests delaying the recapture of the philippines a point of personal pride as well as tactical concern for macarthur macarthur comes back with the comment just now as i listened to his plan i thought i saw our flag going down doubtless the real nimitz would have had something to say about that but the character in the movie just bows his head and meekly accepts the insult in the presence of president roosevelt br br the only person in the movie who macarthur seriously disagrees with is harry s truman who ed flanders does a fine job with despite a prosthetic nose that makes him resemble toucan sam truman's firing of macarthur should be a dramatic high point but here it takes place in a quiet dinner conversation in which peck plays macarthur as nothing less than a genial martyr br br i've never been sold by peck's standing at the upper pantheon of screen stars he delivers great presence but lacks complexity even in many of his best known roles but it's unfair to dock him so much here as he gets little help defining macarthur as anything other than a speechifying bore except for two scenes one where he rails against the surrender of the philippines he struck old glory and ran up a bedsheet and another where he has a mini breakdown while awaiting the u s invasion of inchon inveighing against communists undermining him at the white house peck really plays peck here not the complex character who inspired the famous sobriquet american caesar the real macarthur might have been worthy of such a comparison what you get here is less worthy of shakespeare than shakes the clown
the youthful group in st elmo's fire who just graduated from college barely seem able to make it through high school much less four years at any prominent university for the most part these kids are irresponsible selfish greedy and stupid yet co writer and director joel schumacher appears to hold them up as touchstones for a generation with a now outdated cast of up and comers a background score that sounds awfully similar to that of terms of endearment and writing which lords the smugness of this circle over us fire is a paltry blaze one that gets even more embarrassing as the years pass on 1 2 from
i can't believe currently this movie is rated a 6 9 anyway this movie was probably one of the most touching real indian movies i have ever seen it was really refreshing to see a movie that showed traditional family cinema as for the story i thought it was great it was about shahid kapur being set up on an arranged marriage with amrita rao he is kind of a happy go lucky kind of guy while amrita rao is a traditional indian girl who is very helpful to her uncle but the only problem is her cousin doesn't seem to get as much attention as she does so her aunt dislikes amrita with a passion this upsets amrita because she just wants her aunt to love her it was also very touching to see that although amrita's family wasn't that rich maybe just middle class to lower class while shahids family was quite upper class they still treated their family with respect and didn't even ask put them down which really struck a nerve with me this is because i've actually seen people being very rude to people who are not as well of thinking their below their standards which i feel is very shallow this movie showed that shahids family was willing to look at the great values that amrita had been brought up with and turned a blind eye to the fact she wasn't a rich business tycoons daughter or anything all in all this movie deserved an 8 10 i wish more and more of these kind of movies were made
just imagine the real hitler who was a master of propaganda and speech would have been such a mumbling moron as carlyle portrayed him in this film br br nobody would have followed him not even a desperate unemployed guy in the 1920s br br this is just a hollywood cardboard piece of propaganda itself disguised as true history br br i pity everyone who actually believed anything from this show carlyle and the producers didn't get anything right with this br br why was hitler able to win so many people a whole county for his ideas if we was such a sausage why did people follow him to death by portraying him as such a loser they make their own film totally unbelievable this film is a mixture of old ww2 propaganda and mtv urban myths about one of the most important persons of the last century imagine a film about churchill where the director only shows him as a drunkard for 90 mins br br this film is a disgrace and i wonder how they could talk an actor like carlyle into this dreck
relative to other columbo movies this can only be rated a 1 awful i seriously do not understand what the other reviewers have seen in this appalling train crash of a film it was only through morbid fascination that i continued to watch it to see what bizarre or inept decision the director would make next br br another reviewer suggested that it was falk's only directorial outing because it interfered with his acting role in fact i think the real reason lies with the studio bosses who must have been horrified when they saw what he had done with their money it's a wonder they didn't murder him
i would love to have that two hours of my life back it seemed to be several clips from steve's animal planet series that was spliced into a loosely constructed script don't go if you must see it wait for the video
its about time that gunga din is released on dvd i cannot accurately say how many times i have watched this fine film but i never tire of it the lead actors worked so well together victor mclaglen sgt mcchesney cary grant sgt cutter and douglas fairbanks jr sgt ballentine are an unbeatable team br br i just cannot get over their exploits in india your first glimpse at the sergeants three is when you see them engaged in fighting with other soldiers over a so called treasure map the three sergeants are sent on an expedition to find out what happened to the communications line an they enter a mostly deserted town or so they think br br they engage in the necessary repairs and soon find a few residents in hiding soon after they get attacked by a group of madmen and barely make an escape back to base br br later they are sent on another mission which gives sgt cutter a chance to go hunting for the gold with din they find the temple of gold and are trapped by the evil kali supporters din is sent to fetch help and cutter gets captured soon mcchesney and ballentine arrive with din and they are too captured br br faced with being killed they watch helplessly as their regiment comes to rescue them the evil doers watch and are about to spring their surprise attack when a wounded din climbs onto the golden dome and blows his bugle which then alerts the british to the ambush in doing this din is shot dead br br the soldiers attack the evil ones and soon defeat them at the end din is honored as he is made an honorary corporal in the british army
the best modesty blaise movie i have seen so far it's like a good pilot for a tv series i even think it's a little bit cult like with a lite touch of quentin tarantino's magic or something they have caught a great deal of modesty's character but i admit missing willy garwin a bit even if i have read many comics and book by peter o'donnell i'm not disappointed of this film quite the opposite positive surprised of this story about modesty and her childhood i did not put my expectations so high because of the bad movie from 1966 so i may have overrate this movie just a little but if you like the comics and other storys about modesty blaise you should definitely see this one can't wait for a follow up
i haven't read through all the comments but at least one poster mentioned that the 30 minute version might possibly be abridged i'm curious about that myself because the later parts of the film just didn't make much sense to me even when i rewatched them 30 minutes seems really short for a movie in 1917 also poor little rich girl which was tourneur's next film is 65 minutes long and pride of the clan which was his previous feature was 84 minutes long so i'm relieved to see that i wasn't crazy there must be part of this film missing and that's why the resolution didn't make much sense br br it's hard to review or comment on a movie that you're only able to see half of but i would recommend this film anyway because of the really fascinating view that it provides us of the insides of an east coast movie studio of the time it's the earliest film i've personally seen that's based on the movie industry itself the main character is a movie star played by robert warwick who was later a mainstay hollywood character actor and appeared in almost all of preston sturges' films he plays a western actor perhaps vaguely modeled on william s hart who warwick does resemble somewhat after the really fascinating sequences set in the studio we see them on a location shoot where he discovers a country girl doris kenyon and convinces her to come to new jersey for a screen test which goes very poorly after that point the movie seems to be missing major pieces in the form we have now br br again i'd recommend it to anyone who's interested in film history for the documentary value but in the form we have it doesn't hold up much as a movie and isn't a particularly good example of maurice tourneur's work
i heard many stories about this film being great well i took my chance when i saw it for a cheap price at ebay last month br br i watched it and i have only a few comments about it br br 1 terrible story line 2 terrible acting 3 bad fighting scenes br br i never seen any worse movie in my life so far when the storyline is bad than at least make the fights something more interesting but both are done ridiculously bad br br the only positive thing about this movie in my opinion is nikki berwick god she looks nice in this movie br br that's about it
some day we'll walk in the rays of a beautiful sun some day when the world is much brighter the 5 stairsteps o o h child br br movies about black teenagers usually involve inner city gangs dealing drugs or committing violence to a hip hop soundtrack films about the everyday problems of ordinary inner city teens are hard to find yet there is an undiscovered gem that i would like to recommend our song by jim mckay is about three girls in the crown heights section of brooklyn who learn that their high school will be closed for asbestos removal and must decide on their future direction one that may involve going their separate ways the story is told from the point of view of a 15 year old not from an adult reminiscing about the past as in most coming of age movies avoiding the mandatory street slang and excessive use of f words it delivers an honest and loving portrait of three friends at a crossroads in their life the girls lanisha kerry washington joycelyn anna simpson and maria melissa martinez are in their sophomore year at the local high school they are active members of the jackie robinson steppers a real life marching band whose rehearsals for a labor day parade provide discipline and purpose to their lives br br similar to david gordon green's george washington but less stylized the film showcases non professional black and latino actors with kerry washington as the standout while the performances have some amateurish moments i became so involved with the story that i forgot the girls were even acting maria whose father is in jail has learned that she is pregnant by terrell a local student she wants to have the baby in spite of the fact that she is only 15 and knows that terrell is probably not going to be of much help joycelyn works in an up scale dress shop but dreams about becoming a singer in a very poignant scene in her bedroom she pretends to be talking to her fans then lies down in bed to recite one of her poems she is close to lanisha and maria at the beginning but drifts off to make friends outside of the neighborhood none of the girls receive much support at home and maria is too afraid to even tell her mother about her baby yet the single moms are not typical movie deadbeats or alcoholics they are warm and loving parents whose time with their children is limited because of the pressure of supporting the family br br lanisha's parents are divorced but she is able to visit her father a doorman in a luxury apartment building and talk about music her mother is comforting when lanisha learns that a friend in the neighborhood has committed suicide a somewhat melodramatic plot point in an otherwise realistic film as the summer winds down the girls drift apart and each decides on a different course there are no big dramatic moments however only the sad recognition of the inevitability of change though we do not have blinders on about the frustrations that may await them we identify with their hopes and dreams without dwelling on the negative our song is an emotionally satisfying film about growing up in the projects that refuses to see life in any terms other than possibility
the brain that wouldn't die is one awful piece of film that stinks from the opening credits it's got all the classic signs of being bad unbelieveable plotline terrible acting low grade sets and lighting the plotline goes like this when a doctor and his fiancee get caught in an accident she gets decapitated and he picks up her head and takes her to his lab where he sets up her head in a pan with some special liquid that keeps it alive i'll bet virgnina leath who played the head in a pan had to spend a lot of uncomfortable time wearing that pan around her neck and squatting under a table anyway the doctor then tries to find her a new body and hires two strippers so she can chose one to have her new body bad all the way through so bad it was torn to pieces on mystery science theater 3000
here on imdb com i read an opinion that grey owl is best character of pierce brosnan ever performed i do not know if he had better nor worse roles i'm not his fan but this one was really exceptional br br the other thing impressive hand of the movie director i give my respect the serenity the beauty and spirit of wilderness was illustrated really exlusively i never met such proximity it in any movie before br br another thing left in my mind after the film this is the movie closest to the original books and atmosphere in it br br and little bit more i pay my respect to the original grey owl
in the first one it was mainly giant rats but there were some wasps and a giant chicken too this one however is just giant rats period well giant rats and one really growing little boy this one is about this growing boy and a scientist that is trying to help him so he accidentally creates giant killer rats you know how it is this movie has some kills and its moments but i find it to be on par with the original i just prefer some variety in my giant creature movies well that is not true i actually like empire of the ants maybe i just do not care for giant rodents all in all a rather drab movie though it does have one rather odd turn of events in this one dream sequence that is truly bizarre i just can't recommend this one
warning possible spoilers not that you should care also sorry for the caps br br starting with an unnecessarily dramatic voice that's all the more annoying for talking nonsense it goes on with nonsense and unnecessary drama that's badly but accurately put br br we know space travel is a risky enterprise there's a complicated system with a lot of potential for malfunctions radiation stress related symptoms etc and unexpected things are bound to happen in largely unknown environments they knew stuff could go wrong in fact stuff had gone wrong it's called learning granted appollo 11 wasn't safe by today's standards and there was immense political pressure but the overall performance of the technology on the mission was impressive br br assorted mistakes comments i hadn't even to look up br br 1 nixon prepared a speech in case something went wrong well duh that's what i would've done it was the apex of a propaganda war after all br br 2 nasa gives green light despite the fact that appollo 11 will probably blow up this is only implicit though yeah that's why they let people and press watch in almost real time br br 3 the capsule ejection wouldn't work like it didn't work the time a chimp was in it the one that survived it was a test launch and the rocket exploded the capsule accelerated away and landed with a parachute there's a video of it you can probably find it on youtube or at least look it up somewhere br br 4 one interviewed guy says an explosion would have wiped out a fair part of florida i can only assume it was meant as a hyperbole 'cause if not i'm just aghast how he could get it so wrong br br 5 the technology then was primitive compared to today's standards actually relatively primitive software and hardware is used even today the reason being that it must not crash it's even worse for spacecraft because their computers must be built of comparably large components that aren't that susceptible to radiation and the craft itself must be pilotable manually anyway so a complex steering system like the b2's wouldn't do what's with the fact that they were using tv screens rather than computer screens it's the same damn technology actually tv monitors were and are produced with a significantly higher definition br br 6 if that object wasn't part of the rocket it could be only one thing we see where this is going apart from the fact that the statement is wrong who says it wasn't a rocket part at least an interviewee clears up that if a thing is flying and you don't know what it is it's by definition an unidentified flying object br br 7 the voice over as well as some misquotes make it seem as though the lander's radiation foil was actually its hull which would make it thinner than a space suit br br 8 neil armstrong's near death during a practice flight is footage i can appreciate i hadn't seen it before as i said any piece of manifest technology can go wrong especially if it's not been tested sufficiently on account of being you know unprecedented br br 9 the trajectory discrepancy of the descending lander due to irregularities in the moon's density was at no time acutely life threatening neither was the fifteen seconds of fuel left which was in fact fifteen seconds of fuel left before having to abort the mission and returning to the command module br br 10 a catastrophic chain of events usually results in catastrophe i really don't know how to put it any simpler this however is a prime example of the rhetoric used br br 11 there's a short sequence of one of the astronauts walking and hopping around aimlessly like a gleeful kid followed by the voice over telling us that the reason for this strange behavior can now be revealed turns out he was walking and hopping around aimlessly like a gleeful kid hilarious stuff br br 12 it's mentioned that during re entry all contact was lost this is a perfectly natural phenomenon and it was as well known at the time as it's impossible to circumvent with contemporary technology again the gravity of this is implicit but very purposely so br br 13 there was never a shuttle lost in space itself while the voice over presents this fact as evidence that appollo 11 was a pile of crap appollo 13 was a near loss but the two real disasters happened during liftoff and re entry respectively in any case comparing shuttles to saturn rockets is somehow well okay just plain stupid even ignoring that the successful shuttle missions seem to not have been deemed of interest to the audience br br 14 what the hell's up with the ufo even in the context of the movie it makes no sense unless you assume it was made for entertainment purposes aimed at a specific audience which seems to include people with next to no understanding of either history science or rhetorics br br even the point of the movie is somewhat obscure catch phrases like covered up until now publically revealed here for the first time come up but the film doesn't place any blame or offer a lesson or anything which could be expected of a film so emotionally done in the good old tradition of sensationalism there are numerous interview shots and recording fragments that are often out of context or with people that we know nothing about except nasa scientist wow so the astronauts were very nervous before the endeavor fancy that what does this have to do with the point of the movie again oh yeah which point br br in summary in addition to being either willfully or incompetently inaccurate it's not even good entertainment and believe me i'm a guy who enjoys his crappy documentaries this film isn't funny witty quaint it's nothing
what a relief to find out i am not imagining this programme the summary from taxman is great i too remember finding it haunting and not particularly family viewing i must have been 10 11 at the time i watched it i think for a girl that age part of attraction was lead's very blond hair and his permanently sad state the theme was played on a flute i recall although i cannot remember how it went i think the intro showed him playing it or maybe he played a flute in the programme and especially when he was sad maybe i am destined never to know how it ended or to see clip or hear the tune but at least i now know it is not just me
my first fassbinder was a wonderful experience film and alternative cinema small hall with uncomfortable seats public had to wait while filmrolls were changed were perfect match br br there were many cliches used in the film but fassbinder presented them so cleverly that i found them really amusing sound was also brilliant sometimes back being louder than dialogue br br everything seemed to be in right place and i loved the way how after war time was presented real fun br br
jake speed 1986 was an amusing parody of indiana jones and other adventurer films that were popular during the eighties wayne crawford stars as jake speed an adventurer who's always battling evil doers wherever he goes with his assistant desmond floyd dennis christopher they globe trot looking for some action and some decent story lines the duo meet a young woman named margaret karen kopins who's sister has been kidnapped by an evil white slaver trader john hurt can she find and convince jake and desmond to help her rescue her sibling br br a sappy and cheesy film that doesn't pretend to be something that it's not i have to give this one a recommendation that's if you enjoy movies that like to have fun and for those who don't take everything at face value br br recommended
i saw this film at its new york's high falls film festival screening as well and i must say that i found it a complete and awful bore although it was funny in some places the only real laughs was that there appeared to be o real plot to talk about and the acting in some places was dreadful and wooden especially the lovely lady and the voice of the narrator whom i have never heard of had a lot to be desired j c mac was i felt the redeeming feature of this film true action and grit and out of the cast the only real acting i am sure with another cast and a tighter reign on the directing this could have been a half decent film let us just hope that it is not sent out on general release or if you really want a copy look in the bargain bin in lidl
i don't know why some guys from us georgia or even from bulgaria have the courage to express feelings about something they don't understand at all for those who did not watch this movie watch it don't expect too much or don't put some frameworks just because this is kosturica watch the movie without prejudice try to understand the whole humor inside people of serbia did actually getting married while bil clinton bomb their villages gypsies in all balkans are always try to f ck you up in any way they can love is always unexpected pure and colorful and balkans are extremely creative for those who claims this is a bad movie i can see only that the american's sh t like meet dave get smart etc are much much worse than a pure frank balkan humoristic love story movie as promise me the comment should be useful and on second place should represent the personal view of the writer i think the movie is great and people watch it must give their respects to the director and story told inside it is simple but true it is brutal but gentle and makes you laugh to dead
a comedy gem lots of laugh out loud moments the shop and pub scenes had me belly laughing uncontrollably the characters are recognisable and the dialogue well observed i know people like this the humour is surprisingly gentle and the film this may sound strange puts me in mind of an ealing comedy it's a quirky little film with lots of detail it certainly takes a number of viewings i've watched it a few times i've been showing all my friends and notice something new each time a bit of dialogue something visual that i hadn't picked up on before i could get really picky and find a couple of shortcomings in the film but i'm not going to because overall this is a great fun feel good film which is really worth a watch and which anyone with a sense of humour must enjoy it is a film which will find it's friends and i hope there are a lot of them out there oh and it has a great soundtrack
as incredible as it may seem gojoe is an anime and hong kong inspired samurai action flick with a pacifistic message this ankle of the film is effectively portrayed through the protagonist a great acting job done by daisuke ryu a killer turned to boddhist monk benkei benkei has sworn never to kill again but he still takes up the sword to fight what he thinks is a demon invasion br br gojoe is a film difficult to rate it's visual imagery is stunningly crafted and beautiful but it uses too much trickery circling camera and high speed drives expressionistic shots leeched colors digital effects etc so the end result is somewhat tiring that said the beginning and the ending of the film are nevertheless both elegant and powerful if only the director sogo ishii would have been wise enough not to overuse his bag of tricks br br other problem with gojoe is the amount of violence for a film with such an anti violent message gojoe wastes way too much energy and screen time to depict the endless battle scenes also the way the violence is shown is always on the edge of being self indulgent in fact a blood shower against the night sky seems to be one of the films signature images luckily ishii is wise enough to show the ugly tragic side of violence as well still it seems that ishii is not sure whether he's making a traditional action film or a deeply moral allegory the audience can't be sure of this either until the very end of the film the powerful albeit cynical ending is what saves gojoe it clearly emphasizes that this film is something more than a mere gore fest
spoilers classic 70's sex trash the swedish gal helga was what made this movie so great she was beautiful but what really got to me was how sexual she was she exuded massive quantities of sexuality throughout the film her best scenes were when she was er stimulating herself whenever she was on screen i became transfixed br br also the doctor julia sister of the dimwitted male focus of the film was very interesting visually although most 12 year old girls have bigger breasts than julia she knew how to use what little she had and her scenes especially the scenes with the silk blouse and black skirt also grabbed my attention unmercilessly you also got to love the major hoaky scene where the bats stripped her nekkid i don't know if i've ever seen anything more ludicrous yet sexy at the same time classic stuff
i saw and liked the first two a lot really especially because the second is not just a try to make another one as good as the first and it's a story standing alone you don't have to know the first movie i liked that in the free willy movies too br br but the third here is absolutely useless i tried it with a friend of mine because we both liked the first two we decided to stop after a good half an hour the movie is okay there are funny parts in it alright but what for timon and pumba were funny creatures in the first two movies what lion king 1 1 2 is for me is a hard attempt to get even more fun of the first movie than it had already plus telling the story from their point of view but what for i'd really like to know you know the idea of the two of them sitting in the cinema watching the first one is really nice but what comes after is mostly unnecessary i guess many people liked timon and pumba and so do i really yet for me many parts were very constructed with a try to be funny no chance most of it wasn't funny at all at least for me btw what was the movie about anyway was it a about timon and pumba or b an attempt to get more fun out of the first movie i tend to choose option b and i'm very disappointed about it br br if you like to see stories like the story behind xy you should see rosencrantz and guildenstern are dead by tom stoppard with tim roth and gary oldman that's really funny and no try to get more out of hamlet then it has
jane austen would definitely approve of this one br br gwyneth paltrow does an awesome job capturing the attitude of emma she is funny without being excessively silly yet elegant she puts on a very convincing british accent not being british myself maybe i'm not the best judge but she fooled me she was also excellent in sliding doors i sometimes forget she's american br br also brilliant are jeremy northam and sophie thompson and phyllida law emma thompson's sister and mother as the bates women they nearly steal the show and ms law doesn't even have any lines br br highly recommended
i was thrilled to watch this movie expecting it to be the sequel to the cult classic private lessons which portrays the dream of any male teenager br br private lessons ii has nothing to do with the title i mention it's just a regular soft core cinemax flick that won't make a change in your life there's just one hot sex scene in a rooftop but that's it i watched this a long time ago but believe me this is just a regular boring soft core flick br br the women are hot but that's not enough to rent or buy the movie my advice is to watch this only if it airs on cable
now this is what i'd call a good horror with occult supernatural undertones this nice low budget french movie caught my attention from the very first scene this proves you don't need wild fx or lots of gore to make an effective horror movie br br the plot revolves around 4 cellmates in a prison and each of these characters and their motives become gradually more interesting as the movie builds up tension to the finale most of the action we see through the eyes of carrere who has just entered prison and has to get used to living with these 3 other inmates br br i won't say much because this movie really deserves to be more widely seen there a few flaws though the fx are not that good but they're used effectively the plot leaves some mysteries open and things get very confusing towards the end but malefique redeems itself by the time it's over br br i thought his was a very good movie 8 10
there were some great moments of reality in there depicting modern day life not only in japan but everywhere it shows how stifling ones culture can be and wanting to break out of the mold its created for you br br the dancing was just a vehicle for saying do what you love even if its against the norm rather billy elliot like i would say i enjoyed that film as well br br the humour was well timed and the touching moments felt so real you could feel the awkwardness between sugiyama and his wife the tantrums in the dance hall i loved aoki him and that wig and his excessiveness on the dance floor made me simply howl br br the actors all did a wonderful job the story was well written i watched it a second time and caught some little nuances that i missed on the first viewing good entertainment
ira levin's broadway smash comes to the screen with hardly any meat on its bones a mystery plot with just a few tricks and twists but nobody worth caring about frustrated writer michael caine plots to steal the work of a brilliant young man and pass it off as his own his devious plan may include murdering the talented kid which has caine's flighty spouse up in arms the first act in which everyone is introduced is excruciatingly dead with caine doing everything an actor can to keep the pacing up dyan cannon is miscast as his wife she's too smart and clever herself to be passed off as a ditz and christopher reeve in the middle portion of the film seems extremely uncomfortable in the role of the better writer these three characters and irene worth's bothersome neighbor are so undefined that what happens after the set up barely even registers until well after the second act has begun sidney lumet's direction is stagy and fuzzy the set design unconvincing and poorly lit and the finale is a total disaster the actors struggle to give the script some substance but with such thin material all we see are their laborious efforts 1 2 from
evening is the beautiful story of the flawed love of a mother the movie split in time is magically shot amazingly acted and has a touching script vanessa redgrave plays anne grant lord a woman sun setting out of life lying in her bed her mind remembering and misfiring she recalls her first mistake claire danes plays the young anne giving a youthful vitality to dying bed ridden woman daughters nina toni collette and constance natasha richardson try to decipher the real story from the disheartening dementia her first mistake revolves around harris arden patrick wilson the man her best friend lila mamie gummer deeply loved the daughters must come to terms with their mother's past and their futures the cast is glowing in evening the collective acting energy of this movie could have powered the equipment for the production of this entire film i am so glad to see claire danes working again especially in this role she is so young and alive fully living the joys mistakes and heartbreak of young anne's first mistake this is a true feat when you realize she is playing a woman dying in bed when her life overwhelms her you can feel her desire to crack and her hopeless hope that she won't some of her facial expressions grinded on me a little but over all her performance was so radiant i was left with that only as a side note toni collette continues to prove that you can be a powerful actress without being a super model she plays the black sheep of the family a little lost nina finds a great deal of strength in her mother's mistake collette delicately avoids creating a cruel character who revels in the mistakes of her mother instead choosing the wiser path of learning from her mother's mistakes there is a great deal of infighting between nina and her sister constance their fights remind me of ones i have with my sister all the time mamie gummer who plays anne's youthful best friend is wonderful her character is stuck between her heart and her status in society even when she is crying and her heart is breaking she is incredibly regal and charming i can't wait to see her act in something else in the future vanessa redgrave's performance is very hard for me to describe her talent at making her mental status ambiguous without being wacko or even especially tragic is why it is so powerful the audience does not know if she is making up the story because she is slipping away or if these events truly happened physically and emotionally speaking redgrave is acting in a box not much physical space and limited emotional range might have been a stunner to a lesser actress but she makes the limitations work for her i was constantly amazed the movie is definitely woman focused but the men in the movie are not just accessories patrick wilson is mesmerizing as harris it is no wonder that everyone in the movie is in love with him i sure was buddy wittenborn is lila's brother spiraling out of control hugh dancy spirals buddy out of control without sending his acting down the drain glen close has my favorite scene in the movie it reminded me of the famous scene from monster's ball it is terrible and jaw dropping grief i was utterly stunned the one acting disappointment was natasha richardson while her fight scenes were memorable most of her acting reeks of melodrama it would have suited her to take an acting bath before we had to breathe her stink it's a good thing she wasn't in charge of the visuals the visuals of the movie are sparkling cinematographer gyula pados couldn't make a film richer in color light so perfectly matched to mood and emotion the visual concepts of the flash back sequences are powerful and resonating there were many scenes that could have been stopped printed mounted and sold as art i admit it i cried evening is a powerful movie evening is defiantly a chick flick but a really great chick flick if you want to impress a woman with a movie choice pick evening
another fine effort by america's most underrated filmmaker his knowledge on the subject of racism is staggering and impresses me on more than one level accusations that lee is really just a devious little racist a poisonous dwarf who opportunistically exploits hollywood's affirmative action system to make movies of inferior quality is utter nonsense mere right wing propaganda the very notion that lee would resort to misusing the current climate of political correctness in america in order to produce hate filled anti white movies is simply false and malicious br br some of lee's detractors even go so far as to suggest that gotb glorifies african americans while putting down other races obviously another falsehood disseminated by people who are against peaceful co existence between different races in america and elsewhere br br my favourite scene in the movie is a lengthy dialogue early on between the rich black republican and the others in the bus the views presented by that man are simply wrong all across the board 100 untrue he lacks education unlike the brilliantly informed guys who quite deservedly throw him off the bus br br terrific performances and an intelligent script make for a viewing experience that has been rarely rivaled by any political movies made since br br i also want to point out the incessant lies that the million man march had only 80 000 people taking part in it br br and now all you have to do is take the antonyms of all the words written in capital letters br br so what message does lee send here if someone doesn't agree with your political views you simply apply violence and throw him off the bus i thought the movie said get on the bus br br apparently mr lee is for bus segregation after all i e is no different than those kkk lunatics before him the bus is only for those blacks who are in line with the democratic party's line of thinking so much for freeing the slaves br br the end credits this movie was entirely financed by black people and distributed and marketed by a major hollywood studio run by jews and whites whom farrakhan despises
the good earth is not a great film by any means it is way to ordinary maybe it was different in the 1930's but who would want to see the life of a farmer it is not very interesting to me yes luis rainer and paul muni do an excellent job acting but the film dragged on way too long i could have told you the ending of this movie by the first act in short wang lung muni a small time farmer who does not want to be like his own father turns out exactly like him both falling in love with their wives just as they are on their death beds the film does a complete 360 going from one generation to the next also this film did not have any good character actors or funny moments it just was depressing stuff about lasting as a farmer during a time of crisis
lost is an extremely well made tv series about some people that are lost on an island there's so many twists and turns that you can't really decide who your favourite character is one minute its him then he does something so he's coolest then shes about to do something so shes the coolest then suspense builds up and just as you are about to burst the episode ends and your like noooooooooooooooooooo so you have to wait a whole week too see the next episode but it is worth the wait suspense action romance humour its got it all apart from the topless girls but thats good as it means that you can actually concentrate on the story more and story is what this is all about so if you like a good story and like suspense this is a good one however 24 i think is probably better i have a review on that too that you could check it out i would give lost a good 8 out of 10 mainly because its so unpredictable you never know what will happen next
this is such a fantastic movie a western about a self concerned man jimmy stewart going up to the klondike for gold on the way he gets hassled by a local sheriff in alaska john mcintire giving a wonderfully evil performance whom he hassles back mcintire threatens that he'll be a dead man if he ever comes back through his town which is unfortunately the only way back to the states the main chunk of the story is about the peaceful klondike town of dawson being turned upside down by new residents from mcintire's town ruth roman for instance who has come with stewart and his two companions jay c flippen and walter brennen who plays stewart's best friend builds a saloon a hollywood front for a whorehouse and tries to run the town's restaurant and hang out place out of business she paves the way for mcintire and his goons to come up too in 1953 jimmy stewart and director anthony mann made one of the peaks of the western genre the naked spur the far country is just the tiniest bit less and it contains 99 9 of what made that film so special without of course feeling like a cheap copy like the naked spur the far country boasts beautiful on location cinematography the landscape is gorgeous stewart gives one of his best performances nearly equal to his biggest success of 1954 rear window i suppose it could be considered cliche as he starts out a selfish loner and learns how that kind of existence plays out in the end still stewart plays it so damn well he makes this character very human and the supporting performances are universally fantastic in addition to those i've mentioned the adorable french actress corinne calvet is very good and i ought to single out walter brennen as well he seems to have specialized in playing best friends his relationship with stewart is very touching since he is at first the only character who is able to bring out any humanity in the cynical man the screenplay is very well written and mann's direction is impeccable a masterpiece 10 10
william hurt scuba diving scientist us agents running the investigation abroad the sick contaminated man kicking butt after falling 20 feet on his back and running away sniper missing and not killing hurt just wounding him but the second kill shot is dead on waste of time to compare this to falling down as other reviewers did is ridiculous oh and by the end of the movie they decide to start wearing gloves on their hands except for the evil agent and hurt decides to kill him by giving him the virus handshake what btw when did imdb require 10 lines of text i'm just babbling here doesn't this just dillute the content of reviews if you are required to have x amount of lines
i hope whoever coached these losers on their accents was fired the only high points are a few of the supporting characters 3 of 5 of my favourites were killed off by the end of the season and one of them was a cat to put that into perspective br br the whole storyline is centered around sex and nothing else sex with vampires gay sex with gay vampires gay sex with straight vampires sex to score vampire blood sex after drinking vampire blood sex in front of vampires vampire sex non vampire sex sex because we're scared of vampires sex because we're mad at vampires sex because we just became a vampire etc br br nothing against sex it would just be nice if it were a little more subtle with being peppered into the storyline perhaps have a storyline and then shoehorn some sex into it but they didn't even bother to do that and anna paquin is a dizzy gap tooth bitch either she sucks or her character sucks i can't figure out which br br another part of the storyline that i find highly implausible is why 150 year old vampire bill who seems to have his things together would be interested in someone like sookie she's constantly flying off the handle at him for things he can't control he leaves for two days and she already decides that he's not coming back and suddenly has feelings for dog man give me a break she's supposed to be a 25 year old woman not a 14 year old girl people close to her are dying all over and she's got the brightest smile on her face because she just gave away her v card to some dude because she can't read his mind as the main character of the story i would've hoped the show would do a little more to make her understandable and someone to invest your interest in not someone you keep secretly hoping gets killed off or put into a coma i can't find anything about her character that i like and even the fact that she can read minds is impressively uninspiring and not the least bit interesting br br i will not be wasting my time with watching season 2 come june
you loose 100 iq points just for tuning in this show has to be awful i refuse to tune in from just what i've seen in commercials where did they dig this guy up at anyway also what do they intend to do next season the secret is out everyone already knows the set up are they going to look for people who has been living under a rock to star in next season where are they going to dig up more stupid women no wonder america is a big joke to outsider's look what you are watching
i wasted 5 75 to see this crappy movie so i just want to know a few things br br what was the point of the dog being split in half at the beginning of the movie the disease had nothing to do with being split in half br br what was the point of dragging karen into the shed she already totally infected her room they could have just locked her in there where she would have been safer br br why would the hermit be running around the forest asking strangers to help him when he could have just asked his relative the hog lady to take him to the hospital br br why didn't any of the characters bother to walk into town to get help when things started getting bad are they all really that lazy br br even if paul was threatened by the guy w the shotgun for peeping on his wife paul could have just sent jeff or bert back to the house to ask for help the girl he loves is deteriorating br br what was the point of the box br br why did jeff go back to the cabin after he left when everyone else was getting infected if he was that big of a jerk to leave in the first place wouldn't he have just gone back home br br if the police went to all the trouble of gathering up the kids and burning them on the fire pit why did they throw paul halfway into the river it wasn't even necessary for the plot because the water was already contaminated br br who makes lemonade out of river water that crap has dirt leaves and bugs in it why couldn't the two kids have just use the tap water it was contaminated too so the stupid ending would still work
since the title is in english and imdb lists this show's primary language as english i shall concentrate on reviewing the english version of gundam wing 2000 as presented in the bandai released dvd set my actual review for the whole series is under imdb's entry of shin kidô senki gundam w 1995 br br very little is changed in respect to plot script and characterization its adaptation to english and it really depends on your own taste to choose which language to watch this show in purists can stick to japanese all they want but for a more realistic experience i recommend the english track since all the characters except heero yuy are not japanese most of them are caucasian in fact with a couple of non japanese asians for one thing the characters' personalities come across more directly than in the japanese version the contrast between the characters is stronger thanks to some give or take performances but a very well cast group of actors br br wing gundam's pilot heero yuy is a highly trained soldier who suppresses his emotions but slowly learns the value of his humanity voiced by mark hildreth who's deadpan delivery can be criticized as bad acting but it matches heero's personality very well br br deathscythe gundam's duo maxwell ever cheerful in the face of death is given a crash course in the cherishing the value of life and friends he is possibly the best acted character in the whole show masterfully played by scott mcneil he may sound a little too old for his age but duo's english voice easily out ranks his irritatingly nasal japanese one br br trowa the pilot of heavyarms is a lost lonely soul who's only purpose so far has been combat despite his inner desire to form connections with the people around him he only knows how to kill not to befriend kirby morrow gives a somber but realistic performance as trowa barton br br quatre rebarba winner is voiced by brad swaile who has no trouble brining out the caring nature of the character and the shattering of his innocence as he experiences horrors of war and death first hand a huge plus point is that quatre no longer sounds like a girl and yes he is voiced by a female actress in the japanese version but a bona fide typical 15 year old guy br br the impulsive but determined wufei chang voiced by ted cole may seem a little over the top but it plays out in stark contrast to the more subdued roles of heero and trowa br br relena darlian sounds older in english voiced by lisa ann bailey this might not sit well with her youthful personification early in the series but as her character matures later into the story her voice follows suit and ends up fitting in very well with the character development br br zechs merquise would be one of the more drastically changed voices when compared to the japanese version both voices bring out different sides to the same character his japanese voice is haughty authoritative and commands respect keeping in line with his high ranking status and charismatic nature his english voice by brian drummond is more subdued sounding more devious and snake like highlighting zechs' secretive nature regarding his hidden agendas and staunch beliefs in his ideals br br the members of oz are a mixed bag really treize kushrenada voiced by david kaye is given a more realistic and down to earth performance compared to his larger than life japanese style of speaking however lady une does not convey her split personality as contrastingly as in the japanese version and lucrencia noin just sounds bored most of the time the cannon fodder pilots and military leaders are nothing to speak of either br br i would have appreciated if they took the time to give different characters different accents to reflect their ethnic backgrounds the maganac corp's voices were generally uninspired but could have been more interesting if they were given middle eastern accents the members of the romerfeller foundation would have also sounded better with some classy european accent that reflects their status of nobility br br despite underwhelming acting from the side characters the main cast manage to carry the show and it results in an overall less over the top and more realistic rendition of gundam wing's script very faithful to the original japanese script keeping all the underlying thought provoking ideas and themes about politics war and human nature sadly it also retains the flaws of the original japanese script
the movie is far more sophisticated and intelligent is its exploration of sexual tension than such american attempts as 9 and a half weeks the courtroom scene itself with the couple copulating in the cage while the heroine pleads for their orgasm is amazing i have not seen this movie in 20 years but it made indelible pictures in my mind it is rich in texture and successful in creating a world where sex is the engine for all activity and at its bottom is the yawning angst that lives in us all the plot is european and it meanders a bit but so does life especially when you are 17 and have a constant hard on
moonwalker by michael jackson is a real adventure film for the whole family br br before the real story of the movie starts we get a performance of the bad tour man in the mirror and it kicks off a great movie after that we get a kind of a collage of michael carrier as it was until moonwalker came out in 1988 after a few music videos also speed demon leave me alone etc the story starts br br the plot is basically that michael and his 3 friends who are kids are being chased by the bad guy of the story mr big because they discovered his evil plans of getting children all over the world hocked on drugs during the chase we see fantastic segments fx michaels video for smooth criminal which is absolutely fantastic with its dance sequences etc but then one of the kids get kidnapped by mr big and michael will haft to save her before she gets a drug addict br br during the movie we see special effects not only amazing for those days standards but also impressive today for instance see michael turning in to a robot spaceship in order to protect his friends it's so cool br br the movie ends with a performance of come together later published in michaels double album of history and you leave the movie with a magic feeling amazing br br i recommend this for every family who wants to spend a nice night together with candy and popcorn in front of the tv and now some parents might stand up and say but michael jackson is an alleged child abuser yeah he is indeed but come on we all know it isn't true wait and see
i just want to add my two cents worth and forgive me if i am repeating something that has already been posted but i feel it is worth reminding people of the everlovin' genius of damon runyon without the wonderfully street hilarious writings of damon runyon this film would never have been made nor most of the other great classics that deal with gamblers the like from before 1960 damon runyon worked as a newspaper man and he was from colorado but he sure did get the street scene of the east coast if you are not a dedicated fan of old hollywood comedies i would recommend a few other flicks from damon runyon's writings the lemondrop kid and little miss marker both feature bob hope who aside from his politics has always been a funny man as a west coast liberal i find his politics fairly funny too damon runyon lives
such a long journey is a well crafted film a good shoot and a showcase for some good performances however the story is such a jumble of subplots and peculiar characters that it becomes a sort of jack of all plots and master of none also western audiences will likely find the esoterics of the rather obscure parsee culture a little much to get their arms around in 1 7 hours recommended for those with an interest in india
the performances were superb the costumes delivered a unique feeling for the period and being a victorian living historian i was impressed with the accuracy of weaponry and attention to detail br br i wouldn't say you need any knowledge of the kelly saga to stay with the flow of this movie but to comprehend the happenings and attitudes of the time you will require a bit of basic historical knowledge do not expect as some rather silly people do any of the characters to have the auzzie accent as we know it it was at that time a country during infancy br br ok the story had some elements of fiction but these are required for a wider following of the film gregor jordan said in the extra feature on the dvd that he wanted his movie to 'inspire an interest' and that is exactly what happened with me so this movie gets the thumbs up here br br see it and you will not be sorry
this is such a great film never mind the low rating here i really have no idea where that came from they must be discussing a different film then because i absolutely loved it and found it to be a little hidden treasure br br it's story was so original and charming i really can't think of anything bad to say about it maybe it has to be ''your type of thing'' but i saw this with my sister and my mother and we all were taken by it br br the acting was also very good and that is hard to do in a film like this but i found all the characters very intriguing and sympathetic br br i've always been very fond of dougray scott and found his new ''dark'' role very interesting it is really awful hard to get me to like a bad guy but i absolutely had no problem with that this time even more so i adored him br br everyone who loves a good thriller drama that also has a good dose of love and tragedy should definitely go see this film no question about that anyone wanting to see a film with 80 bloodshed should go rent something else though but i guess the title already kind of gives that away this is a love story not saw 3 br br i give this film 4 out of five stars good job br br xxx enjoy
this clunker of a film sets a new standard for bad filmmaking jared rushton gives an adequate performance of a very poorly created character in an ill fated movie thereby creating a net effect of a very bad movie the film's main thrust is how a boy's temporary excursion into the canadian wilderness after surviving a plane crash solo allows the disgruntled adolescent to deal with his anguish over discovering his mother's extramarital affair unfortunately it turns into a bizarre collage of random survival events including two especially hokey scenes involving fighting a bear and strange hallucinations that make you wonder if this kid isn't just sitting in an alley somewhere on pot dreaming up this whole movie and what a nightmare it is furthermore despite the heralds of some reviewers of the family viewability of the film there are several scenes not suitable for very young children or family viewing including a graphic scene of the dead pilot underwater with one of his eyes apparently exploded br br all in all a terrible movie that nobody should be subjected to much less innocent kids
damp telling of the american revolution br br when farmer 'tom dobb' al pacino and his son arrive in new york harbor they are immediately conscripted by street urchin annie lennox annie lennox to contribute to the war effort br br after getting chopped down by bits of chain link fired from british cannons tom and his son are promptly chastised by continental army sympathizer 'daisy' nastassja kinski for 'not standing their ground' following this kodak moment a series of digressive chapters take place including tom's participation in a 'foxhunt' in which he must carry a model of poor old georgie washington stuffed in effigy while running from a lace handkerchief wielding english captain manning redwood and having a barbecue with a group of iroquois indians as they plan on the best way to sneak back into the fighting so al and his ingrate kid can kick the crap out of british officer donald sutherland's butt br br director hugh hudson presents a unique style of film making and the atmosphere is as thick as the proverbial london fog but the scriptwriter's painting of the redcoats as evil monsters once again reveals hollywood's patented hatred of the british br br steven berkoff appears as an enlisted american soldier
this movie down shifts from 4th into 1st without bothering with 3rd or 2nd grinding gears all the way to the sappy b movie finish line the con at the beginning is easily the best and cleverest part of the movie that is worth seeing the scene with harlow in the bathtub occurs so fast you may miss it definitely not worth all the ballyhoo provided by robert osborne in his tcm intro to this bad to mediocre confusion there is no real conflict and all of the characters in this supposed fringe society turn out to be saints especially the unbelievable character al i wonder if he's got a job for me in cincinnati
'a smile like yours' is a pathetic comedy that actually makes no sense i don't mean that the story was complicated but the entire plot is based on one thing a couple's desperate and expensive unsuccessful attempts to conceive children people who tried that hard must've forgotten of the option of the adoption to which this movie is not kind to br br lauren holly plays jennifer robertson a complete contradiction to anything offered by the women's liberation movement exhibiting almost no sense of independence she is quite a boring character as the dreamy housewife with absolutey nothing else on her mind but to have kids like a dumb 50's romance comedy greg kinnear is her submitting husband who likewise displays no personality no independence and from us no interest br br they are the two most boring and often annoying characters and they hardly make for topics of a comedy that should present itself with many mishaps which should arise from a couple doing all they can to get pregnant except they really don't do anything except go to a fertility clinic and shell out a whole lot of money to do what they could do in the privacy of their own except for that in vitro fertilization number the plot hardly allows for any mishaps because well the couple don't do anything to create any sort of bizarre situation they just go to this clinic so what br br the subplots are meant to test the faithfulness of the couple a necessary moral element of the story since the couple does plan on conceiving children together jennifer works at a new age shop with her friend played by joan cusak and they are in the business of developing aphrodesiacs christopher macdonald plays the intrested buyer and jennifer is the promising negotiator of a pretty price for her and her friend's product the subplot hardly offers much to keep you interested although joan cusak is pretty funny in the restaraunt scene br br danny kinear is an architect who finds an opportunity to make some extra money to cover the clinic bills by taking on a job in seattle where his boss is the crass seductress also another hopeless helpless female character who tries to influence danny as dumb as he is to have an affair with her once things are conveniently rocky with him and his wife for reasons i don't care to give away jill hennesy is good in the role but her character is too predictable and too formulaic as a much needed element to create conflict for danny it is stupid and once again hardly interesting br br the overall movie itself is utterly boring and hardly funny at all save the restaraunt scene and the airline flight the plot offers nothing that is really attention grabbing even if the story was entirely about two people trying to conceive the writers could've figured out several hilarious mishaps to develop out of that second the main characters are completely boring they are complete silouhettes of dumb 1950s comedies with happy wife and clueless husband so even without mishaps present in the plot the characters themselves offer nothing interesting let alone funny br br joan cusak should've been in the lead and someone else should've taken kinnear's part cusak would've made even a lousy story outrageously funny as she sometimes does in her co starring role here this is definitely one to pass up
this has got to be one of my very favorite twilight zone episodes primarily for the portrayal of two lonely souls in a post apocalyptic environment br br the cobweb strewn shops and rubble laden streets are eerie in that particular way the twilight zone does best br br while the parable can be a bit heavy handed by today's drama standards it is an excellent one using the setting to make a statement relevant to the human experience as well as geopolitics in a way that is timeless the entire drama rests solely on the shoulders of mr bronson and ms montgomery who do not disappoint may they both rest in peace br br a true classic
spoiler this is a great film about a conure he goes through quite the ordeal trying to get back to his little girl owner he learns a lot through his journey and meets up with a lot of other beautiful birds if you love birds like my wife does this film is for you this film also has some sad parts that make the tears run in the end it all works out for paulie and his russian friend rent this for the whole family everyone will enjoy this
even though there's a repertoire of over 180 films to choose from this 'succubus' is often named as the best jess franco film heck even the legendary filmmaker fritz lang counts 'succubus' among his personal favorites so maybe it's me but i thought this was a dreadfully boring and overly confusing movie the opening is great though and shows janine reynaud performing an sm act on stage it's all downhill from here unfortunately reynaud's character is a maneater who eventually kills her lovers in some sort of trance franco had a decent budget to work with and spends it well on nice locations beautiful photography and a mesmerizing musical score this could have been his greatest film indeed if it wasn't for the lame and uninteresting story it's supposed to be psychedelic but i'd say sophomoric is a better term to describe what's shown here half of the time you don't have a clue what's going on or what exactly is said so even the short running time of 80 minutes seems to last ages this most certainly isn't franco's best film according to me i wouldn't even recommend it to die hard exploitation fans if you're looking for more superior jess franco film try to get your hands on 'las vampiras' 'the awful dr orloff' or 'female vampire'
i have a nice collection on movies going and this one was added to it number 274 to be exact br br the title had me going at first splatter university i thought this would be a great horror movie was i ever wrong don't get me wrong this is not the worst movie i have ever seen but it could have been a lot better i love all movies but this one was one that was more of a laugh then a scare br br poor audio quality poor acting and poor shot arrangements are some of the areas that could have been improved 3 out of 10 stars br br movie is ideal for a good laugh if your looking for one of those movies to make fun of then this is one
that this poor excuse for an amateur hour showcase was heralded at sundance is a great example of what is wrong with most indie filmmakers these days br br first of all there is such a thing as the art of cinematography just picking up a 16mm camera and pointing it at whomever has a line does not make for a real movie br br i guess we have to consider ourselves lucky the director didn't pick up someone's camcorder br br second indie films are supposed to be about real people there's nothing real in this film none of the characters come across as being even remotely human br br what they come across as being is figments of the imagination of a writer trying to impress his buddies by showing them how cool and edgy he is br br sorry but this is not good writing or good directing br br what is left is a husk of a bad movie that somehow made its way to sundance hard to believe this was one of the best films submitted br br in any case it made me loose what was left of my respect for the sundance brand
i like many horror fans have been force fed the same banal big budget hollywood remakes and mtv high school slasher tripe for the last 20 years here at last is an original horror genre movie that ticks all the right boxes br br you want a hot lead actress you want vampires you want cool weapons you want cool vehicles and you want blood lots of it by the bucket load you got it br br with excellent fight choreography and a supporting role from the hammer horror scream queen herself stephanie beacham this really is fantastic stuff br br despite it's low budget by opting to use 35 mm stock and adding quality cg effects to the mix director james eaves has created something that feels much bigger br br a must for old school horror fans
it takes a little while to get used to nick nolte's nebraskan locutions before we can easily accept him as a famous intercontinental playwright once you get past the bar it turns into a fascinating story of a man who loses everything while trying to do good br br nolte an american moves to germany marries a famous actress and is a satisfied success in every respect until war is about to break out he's visited by a jovial american john goodman who persuades him to accept a post as an anti semitic radio broadcaster for the nazis nolte has no politics but thinks it's a challenge to write a role that's almost impossible and then play it himself another american secret agent will modify nolte's radio scripts inserting a cough here a sneeze there that will serve as a code for the transmission of intelligence to the allies there's a catch though nobody will know about nolte's real role as an american agent except goodman donovan and roosevelt himself if he's ever uncovered he'll be refused recognition by the americans br br nolte plunges ahead and his vicious broadcasts are wildly popular in germany his adored wife sheryl lee knows nothing of what's going on nor does she care nolte and lee live in what he repeatedly refers to as a nation of two the war ends and the trouble begins he's captured by americans who are bitter because of his betrayal they beat him and leave him in the mud he's rescued by goodman his fairy godmother who sends him to an anonymous existence in greenwich village and sends him a little cash now and then br br by 1960 he manages to cultivate a friendship with his neighbor the painter alan arkin who has also lost his family and claims the two now belong to a secret brotherhood but his location and his identity somehow leak out and he is more or less adopted by a group of ancient aryan racists led by a dentist and a priest his house front and mailbox are painted with swastikas and accusations he's beaten senseless by an ex gi but miraculously his beloved wife is returned to him by the ancient aryans another catch it turns out later that it's not his wife but rather her younger sister who has loved him since adolescence br br the ending has him typing his memoirs in an israeli jail in 1967 before his trial for crimes against humanity it's not a happy ending br br nolte can talk with but not see the occupant of the cell above his in jail it's adolf eichmann eichmann seems pleasant enough he advises nolte that it's a bad habit to type for fifteen straight hours it's important to relax you must learn to relax nolte laughs out loud and shouts that's how i got here the film is filled with such ironies at one point in their relaxed conversations arkin tells him that in spite of everything i still think people are good at heart i don't know if the movie was a commercial success but if it wasn't that's the sort of thing that might have torpedoed it for a younger audience of theater goers who may never have heard of anne frank let alone that supposedly final statement in her diary br br the fact is that it's a movie for adults and patient adults at that the story moves slowly there's very little violence no car chases no shootings and people don't seem subject to manic speech pressure a lot of it will probably slip past viewers who don't open themselves to its deliberate approach nolte refers to the war time relationship between him and his wife as a nation of two this is a pretty compact phrase no doubt anyone could come up with a glib definition but it takes a little concentration to grasp its emotional import br br it's a story of a man who loses everything his ability to write his identity his wife twice his sole friend his country his self respect at one point he stops walking along a crowded new york street and simply stands there until after dark when he is moved along by a curious cop the reason he stopped is that he simply has no place to go what vonnegut is describing is far more than depression i don't mean to sound condescending but it's the sort of feeling that's hard to understand in your youth adolescents might like to think they know what's holding nolte in that one spot but it really requires maturity and the quickened sense of finiteness that only maturity can bring br br remember robert frost's line about home being the place that when you go there they have to take you in well no place will take nolte in
the third muppet movie is perhaps the most relaxed and pleasing with the gang taking their modest college musical to the bright yet volatile lights of broadway filled with typically naïve optimism of course their first attempt fails and kermit leader of the group and author of the show blows his top so the others all go their separate ways so that he won't have to feel responsible for them kermit himself befriends a young wannabe fashion designer making ends meet by serving food at her father's diner the old man then has a line in particularly tortuous non sequiturs we get the usual cameo appearances by a variety of stars art carney as a producer james coco as an overzealous dog owner dabney coleman as a confidence trickster elliott gould who was also in the muppet movie 1979 gregory hines liza minnelli as herself  having her portrait at a classy restaurant replaced by kermit's sporting fake moustache as an ostensibly celebrated entrepreneur in a ruse to attract publicity to the muppets' show brooke shields and even director john landis in possibly the film's funniest scene as a broadway producer before whom kermit appears acting streetwise and chummy and hilariously donning shades and an afro wig the other muppets more or less go through their typical paces with regrettably less space given to gonzo this time around while miss piggy is something of an acquired taste with me the scenes in which the latter spies on what she takes to be kermit's romance with the waitress  and especially her violent reaction to this  are undeniably funny what disappoints however is the climactic show itself after a fairly redundant midsection wherein kermit gets amnesia and eventually picks up advertising on madison avenue which rather than the expected splashy routines procures nothing more original than the wedding ceremony of kermit and his eternal flame miss piggy
can scarcely imagine a better movie than this br br hey before you all go chick flick on me i am a very large strong masculine macho man who happens to think this was one of the better movies of the last 20 years br br the acting was superb and the story was marvelous this is wonderful medicine for the heart and soul the acting could not have been better nor the movie better cast br br i have known for a good while that mercedes ruehl along with holly hunter joan plowright dame edith evans sissy spacek judi dench is among the greatest actresses ever to appear on film and of course cloris leachman also in this film in my view may in fact exceed them all in the shear magnum of her talent and varied roles she has appeared in over the years at any rate this was an amazing cast this film was like a book that you cannot lay down and when you have reached the last page wish for more still more i cannot for the life of me understand why this film here on the imdb only rates a 3 9 br br that rating here is utterly amazing to me or perhaps not perhaps in fact i do understand it ever so well and that is what makes me really sad it makes me ever so sad that films like american beauty leaving las vegas sexy beast and fight club ratings skyrocket off the charts in popularity when they in fact at least in this viewers opinion should have received an r rating r that is for rubbish hey o k i realize there are a lot of different stories in this world for a lot of different audiences but it is a sad commentary when this lovely powerful extraordinarily directed acted and written film seems to be over looked br br it obviously was at the academy awards as well how sad and how predictable my summation is that if you want to see a powerful happy sad beautiful story watch preferably own this film
i was lucky enough to get a free pass to an advance screening of 'scoop' last night full house at the theatre and when the movie ended there was spontaneous applause i didn't speak to anyone who disliked 'scoop' although two teenagers sitting next to me sighed and fidgeted uncomfortably for most of the film they were the exception though because everyone else including myself really enjoyed themselves br br 'scoop' is a quickly paced murder mystery a young female journalism student is unwittingly maneuvered by forces beyond her control into trying to catch a serial killer on the loose plenty of hijinks ensue as she partners up with a traveling illusionist and falls in love with a frisky and charming young nobleman br br 'scoop' isn't a bad addition to the woody allen filmography it isn't his best work but it is a very enjoyable and light hearted romp i'd say it fits quite comfortably into being an average woody allen film right in the middle of the pack if you're a woody allen fan you'll probably enjoy yourself if you're indifferent to his work then 'scoop' might be enough to get you interested in seeing more i don't think that anyone who dislikes his style of film making and acting are going to change their mind woody plays the same kind of neurotic character we've grown so accustomed to although it borders dangerously close to forced and over the top in this film while potentially aggravating for some who might find themselves wishing he'd hurry up and just spit out the words woody allen fans know what to expect br br very good performances all around in my opinion although i found myself missing ian mcshane who is excellent and not on camera nearly enough hugh jackman is great as the charming nobleman and i think woody allen has found a new regular star to work with in scarlett johansson i think that with 'match point' this is their second pairing and she's just magic with the material that woody gives her could be the beginning of a beautiful relationship i'm glad i saw the movie and definitely recommend it more sophisticated comedy than movies like 'scary movie 4' so if your brand of comedy is the latter rather than the former 'scoop' probably isn't for you if on the other hand you like a touch of class sophistication and fun 'scoop' is for you probably not the woody allen film i'd introduce to a newcomer but all others should give it a try
i guess this movie will only work on people who were all turned off by the giant hype of lord of the rings well so i was and so i really love this movie especially i like all those flawless superheroes from lotr being so perfectly and disrespectfully parodied most brilliantly is the counterpart of gandalf the brave and wise and completely humorless know it all wizard almghandi the cowardice and brain dead transvestite sauron's counterpart sauraus from east germany of course is wearing a simply bucket with eye holes as a helmet aragorns alter ego is yet another accident prone idiot who tries to fix his broken sword ulrike the legend with scotch tape and strunzdumm the counterpart of wormtong indeed has some strong resemblance with brad dourif and don't forget grmpfli and heidi huh huh
this one is a real bomb we are supposed to believe that merle oberon is the sequestered daughter of an ambitious politician who must prove to the tom delay of the 1930s that he is worth supporting as a presidential candidate poor merle can't go anywhere but is surrounded by politicians and their quacking quaking wives and supported only by kindly uncle harry davenport she joins her two maids on a blind date and gary cooper happens to show up some shots of rodeo might have enlivened things a la misfits but no such luck with this one gary later breaks in to a formal dinner at which merle is presiding and though invited to sit down and join the group reads them a lecture on their snobbery where did this diffident cowboy's sudden eloquence come from the most excruciating scene in the film is a phantom party that gary holds in his unfinished house for his absent wife merle will it never end one to avoid
telemundo should definitely consider making a dvd collection of the novela xica i know tons of people including myself who would like to be able to purchase the novela xica it is a very entertaining novela which is set in brazil the costumes worn by the actors are beautiful and the town in which the novela takes place is beautiful xica contains a lot of history of that time period i wish telemundo would televise it again even if it was a 2 in the morning i would highly recommend watching xica if it is ever shown again on telemundo i've e mailed telemundo a million times already to show the novela again but my pleas have fallen on deaf ears the only cautionary statement about xica is that it occasionally contains some harsh scenes therefore i would recommend that children under 14 do not watch xica overall xica merits a 10 out of 10
watching it lives by night makes you wonder just who in the world greenlit this crap a newlywed couple go spelunking on their honeymoon get attacked by bats and the husband starts to run around in his pajamas attacking various people and where exactly are they they're in the desert then they're skiing then they're in a small town that looks like it has mountains nearby the town is run by a sheriff who likes to watch and has a personal vendetta against whiny doctor boy the ski hospital is run by a really groovy guy with a nice thick mustache and the wife looks like mary tyler moore or marilyn quayle there's no dramatic tension and the ending will leave you filled with anger special effects and makeup guru stan winston did the effects for this movie i guess you have to start somewhere
this afternoon we took the kids to the movies and saw neil gaimans stardust and all i can say is wow br br it is rare that i am completely taken aback by anything but this is quite possibly the greatest fantasy movie i have ever seen maybe even the best movie of any kind and it is all neil gaiman's fault br br sure i could have been sucked in by the wonderful dialog which was smart flowed smoothly and made the characters completely believable br br i could go on for days about the spectacular acting charlie cox is perfect as tristan claire daines is brilliant as yvaine and robert di nero almost steals the movie as the deeply in the closet pirate captian shakespeare br br the pure joy brought about by the humor which managed to be laugh our loud funny intelligent enough to make the first shrek look like an 80's sitcom and blend in perfectly with the rest of the movie alone would have made this a great movie br br special effects were near perfect true this was no lotr or star wars sf extravaganza but where they were use they were exactly what was called for not too much to distract you from the movie itself and blended into the story perfectly br br then there is the story what can i say how often do you come across a story containing all of the classic fairytale formula components that doesn't just come off as another cheap princess bride knockoff it manages to be familiar and comfortable and yet completely new and refreshing at the same time br br any one of those things would have made this a good movie all of them combined make it a great movie but they pale in comparison to the rich enchanting world that those elements combine to bring to life well once again neil gaiman has done it he has driven another dagger into my heart by creating a world of fantasy that is so beautiful and enchanting that i would do almost anything to live in it and only given me a short glimpse into it i didn't want it to end i wanted to be sucked through a vortex to the land of stormhold and get to meet tristan and yvaine in person to travel it's fields and valleys stroll through it's marketplaces and meet it's residents both dangerous and friendly and stay there forever it is a feeling that i have noticed whenever i have read anything by gaiman the sandman american gods coraline all left me with a deep sense of sadness when i finished reading them because it was over i could not see anything more into the worlds he had created which seemed to be so much more vibrant and alive than the one i am forced to live in and watching stardust was no different br br in the end i'm sure that neil's writing and this movie won't have the same effect on everyone but trust me when i say you will not regret the time or money spent watching this movie it is easily one of the top 5 movies i have ever seen and i can guarantee that anyone at all with a soul will at least like it
this is a nice piece of work very sexy and engaging enough plot to keep my interest throughout its main disadvantage is that it seems like it was made for tv full screen and though there were several sex scenes there was absolutely no nudity but boy did it come close strange too since netflix shows that it was rated r br br nonetheless very titillating and i wish alicia silverstone made more movies like this br br one netflix reviewer stated that it was part of a series but i have been unable to find out what series that is i'd like to find out though because this movie was that good br br walt d in lv 8 23 2005
in a way this is the disaster fellini has been working towards all his life the line between absurd masterpiece and free association bullshit is very small and what category a film will ultimately fit in will often just depend on personal feelings that said casanova left me in cold admiration for its sets and little more that cannot be summed up more adequately by bukowski br br casanova died too just an old guy with a big cock and a long tongue and no guts at all to say that he lived well is true to say i could spit on his grave without feeling is also true the ladies usually go for the biggest fool they can find that is why the human race stands where it does today we have bred the clever and lasting casanovas all hollow inside like the easter bunnies we foster upon our poor children br br as far as i could make it out this is the position fellini takes regarding his subject granted with more empathy but disgusted nonetheless br br casanova's environment is made from decay and incestuous behavior themes fellini dealt with more pointedly in satyricon the succession of plot is characteristic of soft porn just without the coherence and donald sutherland is ugly and slimy to the point of distraction br br yet there might just be a point in portraying casanova as an unsightly fool and i challenge anybody to formulate this point without being obvious fellini couldn't more than ever he seems here like a dirty old man a maestro for sure but one whose impulses satisfy himself more than anybody else i find it hard imagine an audience who enjoys this film it was a story not worth telling
drew latham ben affleck is determined not to be lonely this christmas not only is drew a millionaire but also obnoxious and guilty of being very grandiose drew goes back to the home he grew up in and offers the family living there the valco's 250 000 to be his family through the christmas season tom valco james gandolfini is reluctant but is greedy enough to take drew's offer christine valco catherine o'hara has little to say in the matter but learns to like having drew around not exactly the same sentiment with daughter alicia christina applegate but that too has room for change drew's girlfriend missy jennifer morrison tracks down drew and wants her folks to meet his family genuine fun is in store as a happy noel becomes a hilarious dysfunctional nightmare other members of the cast josh zuckerman bill macy david selby and stephanie faracy affleck is comedic albeit strange
the cure uses voice over to create an intense mood although the vo accounts for all of the film's lines it amazingly does not take away from the visual story the use of multiple film stocks add a lot of texture to the story the choice of combining b w and color worked nicely to enhance the leaps in time the ending will make you jump despite being able to anticipate the result i was especially enjoyed the thrill of the film's suspense the close ups for the love scene are also lovely and reflect a tasteful eye the piece is quite short but accomplishes a lot the tight editing really helps to show off what a short film can do worth watching more than once
when viewing a movie as silly as 'hot rod ' one must sit back relax and alter one's intellectual capacity to a like state  which is in this case a state dimwitted enough to endure brainless drivel that has somehow been mistaken for comedy with a brief runtime of 88 minutes this film was long past drawn out and buried itself beneath a bundle of repetitive jokes  jokes that came at a minority and weren't even funny in the first place 'hot rod''s base material is as superficial and irrelevant as 2004's cult hit 'napoleon dynamite ' though it's much more contrived and comes without any of the laughter in fact the movie's blatant desperation to be compared to 'napoleon dynamite' is scornful and offensive and left me ticked off instead of just being annoyed br br the movie if one were compelled enough to call it such poses a paltry story that puts self proclaimed stuntman rod kimble before us with the trifling intention of jumping fifteen buses one more than his idol evel knievel jumped so we're told by rod and raising 50 000 dollars for his stepfather's impending life saving heart operation all so that he can fight his stepfather once recovered and gain his respect because in order to gain one's respect one must first fight them huh whatever each character is no more interesting than rod's stick on mustache and from the film's opening joke to its ridiculous conclusion each scene played like a nonsensical and terribly unfunny snl skit  which with the addition of an extra 85 minutes is essentially what 'hot rod' strives to be br br the film's star andy samberg contributed an effort to the screen that observably exerted every last drip drop of his comedic capabilities unfortunately  rather realistically  his humorous talents are no more admirable than a five year old retelling his own exhausted joke that somewhere includes the innocently crude poop and pee pee gags and if that's disappointing pull a chair hide your face in your hands and brace yourself for the real blow he is the film's humor to rescue them of their mortification i'll willingly omit the ghastliness of samberg's co stars' roles and leave the second third of the lonely island team director akiva schaffer to his non existent talent as a director or a comedian basically every thing one could possibly do to further trample a crash course comedy is perfectly portrayed here and done so arrogantly as though the film would be funnier that way trick yourself into believing that there's even a single laugh in this heap or treat yourself to another movie  any other movie
this is one of the best reunion specials ever with adam west and burt ward parodying themselves and having fun while doing it it's amazing the amount of effort that went into the detail particularly recapturing the feel of the 1960's era the batcave set wayne manor the costumes and the actors selected to play the younger versions of west ward burgess meredith cesar romero and frank gorshin this 90 minutes is well worth your time and is a delight to all fans of the classic 1960's batman television series i note that clips from batman were from the movie and not the series itself probably because of legal restrictions let's hope the three seasons of the show are forthcoming on dvd
i am sorry to fans of this film but it is the worst thing i have ever seen slow badly cast and badly acted it is a film trying to escape the deadbeat romcoms of the recent years and failing mcdonald and parker seem unable to convey real emotion and are lifeless they seem to be in this one for any pay checks they are getting for it and not because they thought it was a good idea the plot is dull i love great chick films as much as the next girl and this is not one if you avoid one film this year let it be
shot on an impossible schedule and no budget to speak of the movie turned out a lot better than you would expect certainly much more true to the peter o'donnell books and comic strip than the previous two films you can read the strip currently in the reprints from titan books or in comics revue monthly it is one of the greatest adventure comic strips of all time the movie isn't great but unlike most low budget films it makes the most of what its got and it holds your interest on the dvd extras the interview with quentin tarentino who is obviously stoned is a gas some people have faulted tarentino for associating his name with the film but without him it would never have been made he is a modesty blaise fan and picked a good writer and director all things considered worth 8 stars
starlift is a pleasant and interesting throwback to those all star musical pictures that every studio was putting out during the world war ii years when you've got such stars as gary cooper james cagney doris day gordon macrae and randolph scott etc in the film and with such people as the gershwin brothers cole porter jule styne and sammy cahn supplying the music it's an easy to take film and the plot isn't even in the way br br what plot there is involves two air force enlisted men dick wesson and ron hagerthy trying to meet warner brothers starlet janice rule using as a gimmick the fact that both come from youngstown ohio and hagerthy's father was rule's dentist as well as half of the town's the scheme works too well as louella parsons is soon putting them as an item in her column yes louella's in the film as well she must have liked warner brothers or jack warner catered to her more than the other studio bosses because she also used this studio to publicize her hollywood hotel radio program back in the day br br but the rest of the plot also touched on the real life efforts of ruth roman also playing herself to get her studio and others to do shows at the air force bases for the servicemen and women going to korea some of the names i've mentioned and others sing and perform in a show at travis air force base where a lot of this film was shot br br one specialty number was shot for the talents of phil harris who sing narrates a ballad look out stranger i'm a texas ranger aided and assisted by virginia gibson frank lovejoy and gary cooper yup cooper looked like he was having a great old time kidding his image br br this is the oldest of clichés when you say they don't make them like this any more but they really don't because you don't have a studio system that has all this talent under contract that's one thing about the demise of the old studio system we can mourn
syriana swept the critics upon release and everything seemed to be raving about it i suppose it's one of those films that is intensely intelligent so intelligent that i think you need to be well versed in the oil industry and a politically brilliant mind i don't consider myself unintelligent i've been studying politics since my early teens and i enjoy an intelligent film but for the most part unless it's a documentary films are meant to be primarily entertaining as well as have a message syriana tried to be strictly intelligent and it does turn some people away i would even go so far as to say that those who rave about it and insist it's a 10 10 are lying because they think they look better this film was the most confusing senseless mindless dribble i have seen in awhile especially considering the critical acclaim the oscar nods and the cast screenplay writer stephen gaghan has disappointed me yet again his horribly written havoc preceded this film and i think he's just trying way too hard i can't believe he was offered the opportunity to write the da vinci code screenplay on top of that gaghan directed the film which made it an absolute mess i had no idea who anyone was why things were happening who was who and what was what it was a disaster br br because i don't really know who anyone was i can only mention the actors and what i thought of their performances because despite the horrendously complicated script the actors did alright george clooney plays c i a field agent and assassin i think bob barnes clooney has never been a favorite of mine but lately he's managed to churn out some decent performances and this seemed to be a pretty good performance on his part barnes was a complex character with a sordid history and if i knew what was going on with him i would have really enjoyed his character matt damon plays bryan woodman and he is rather bland and always looks like a deer in the headlights which i can understand his confusion after reading this script and then trying to perform it amanda peet plays his wife and she does well in the few scenes she is given christopher plummer makes a cameo appearance as someone doing something i like plummer and love seeing him show up even if he doesn't get top billing anymore br br the cast is intense if only the story made sense i'd like to exact quote the description of plot on imdb a missile disappears in iran but the cia has other problems the heir to an emirate gives an oil contract to china cutting out a us company that promptly fires its immigrant workers and merges with a small firm that has landed a kazakhstani oil contract the department of justice suspects bribery and the oil company's law firm finds a scapegoat the cia also needs one when its plot to kill the emir apparent fails agent bob barnes the fall guy sorts out the double cross an american economist parlays the death of his son into a contract to advise the sheik the cia wants dead the jobless pakistanis join a fundamentalist group all roads start and end in the oil fields what say who now syriana might be the thinking man's movie but it bored me to tears and no matter how hard i tried to stay with it i eventually surrendered and turned it off after an hour and a half and you couldn't have bribed me enough to get me to finish it i suppose if you want to form an opinion than by all means watch it but i promise you someone looking for entertainment or an enjoyable film will be asleep in the first half hour 1 10
the third and last part of the bourne trilogy duh is lacking a bit in the story department but covers it with extensive action scenes twi in particular take up quite some of the running time and make this movie better br br the director and star damon themselves agreed that it was difficult to find a story for the last part because the end of the second movie was quite advanced story wise how they got around that the action scenes for once but they did another thing too which i can't reveal because that would be a spoiler but if you watch the movie than you'll notice it funnily enough i read that this adaptation of the bourne books is the least accurate of all three films if that means anything to you o
i won't go into too much detail about the plot of this movie as other reviewers have covered pretty much the same ground br br just wanted to say that i really enjoyed the film very much peter falk's performance alone is reason enough to watch the film br br a small scale 'road trip' movie with falk paul reiser in upstate ny in the fall is the setting for most of the action in the film br br very well written with an adult target audience in mind plenty of reality based humor some well played drama give the film a feeling that it could be your own family br br really can't say enough about this film except that it's a damn shame that a lovely movie like this doesn't get more exposure while other trashy junk out there does br br it's great to see falk with a big leading man role again he makes the most of it it proves that his famous friend writer director john casavettes was right in casting falk in many of his ground breaking films of the 60s 70s
reading a wide variety of scoop reviews over the past few days i walked into the theater prepared for a subpar outing from woody happily i couldn't have been more wrong granted woody the performer is slowing down a touch or two but woody the writer director is in fine form and found a credible way to integrate his 70 year old self into the story judging from the laughter and guffaws the audience ate up allen's one liners and dialogue in a way that i haven't seen in several years br br in a movie landscape dominated by software approved story arcs twentysomething tastes and assembly line formula fare for kiddies it's a source of both satisfaction and inspiration to see allen pursuing his highly personal and still rewarding path
this movie has everything emotion power affection stephane rideau's adorable naked beach dance it exposes the need for real inner communion and outer communication in any relationship just because cedric and mathieu are a couple who happen to be gay doesn't mean there isn't quite useful insight for anybody in it i would probably classify it as a gay movie but one that can be appreciated and loved by heterosexual people as well as homosexual and bisexual people mathieu's incapacity to handle his emotions divulges the way our society doesn't encourage us to act any differently and that is what engenders the discord between him and cedric this is definitely a must see
picture the classic noir story lines infused with hyper stylized black and white visuals of frank miller's sin city then picture a dystopian science fiction thriller such as steven spielberg's minority report or richard linklater's a scanner darkly an amalgamation of the above would be a suitable way of describing visionary french director christian volckman's bleak and atmospheric take on the future in his feature film debut but although volckman's work does unquestionably take reference from the aforementioned films and those similar to them such a simplistic hybrid does not do renaissance volckman's end result justice the film itself is a far more complex piece of work than that br br genre hybridity is usually a hit and miss affair especially in a contemporary context with the well of individuality appearing to be increasingly exhausted as such renaissance is laudable as a cinematic experiment at the very least with its unique interspersing of the gritty nihilism of the neo noir detective thriller and the fantastic allegorical terror of the dystopian sci fi drama which serve to compliment each other's storytelling conventions in a strangely fitting fashion the screenplay is a clever and intriguing one although one gets the sense that many of the lines in the script would have been much more effective in their original french than the english translation the film's title also becomes far more poignant managing to stay one step ahead of its audience all the way through though many elements of the plot will seem quite familiar to those who frequent such science fiction thrillers the script throws unexpected twists and turns in at exactly the right moment to keep the viewer on their toes making for a truly compelling work br br volckman's film truly excels in its visual component and the stunning black and white animation is easily the film's highlight superbly moody and stylish it goes to show what tremendous aesthetic effect the simple use of two shades can have with tremendous detail paid to the composition and look of each shot and superb use of very noir shadows and intriguing angles to accentuate the emotional tension of the scene the film appears straight out of a frank miller comic but with a twist the end result being consistently visually sumptuous br br the film's english rendition is also given added credence by its very fitting array of voice casting the gruff voice of daniel craig is an absolutely perfect piece of casting for grim stoic policeman karas and catherine mccormack is a strong presence as the mysterious woman whose sister's disappearance he is investigating despite a wavering english accent romola garai does great work as the frantic sister in question and jonathan pryce is suitably menacing as the shady head of ominous mega corporation avalon ian holm's reedy voice is also a strong choice as a mysterious scientist and holm makes a powerful impression in his brief scenes br br all together renaissance boasts a visually stunning unique and compelling futuristic thriller just as intelligent as it is entertaining though the plot may seem familiar to those who frequent such fare and the occasional weak line may inhibit the film from being the moody masterpiece it set out to be the superb animation in itself easily carries the film through its occasional qualms for fans of either of the film's intertwined genres or the gritty graphic novels of frank miller or those willing to appreciate a capably crafted slightly less conventional take on the futuristic thriller the film is without question worth a watch br br 8 10
but it is kinda hilarious at least if you grew up on weird al like i did it's a mockumentary about his life and career beginning with superstardom and going back to trace the origins it's uneven in places but some of the segments are still very funny particularly when he goes to japan although it's not quite as emotionally textured as lost in translation and he doesn't find love however fleeting he does capture in a bottle the absolutely bizarre cultural melange that is tokyo street life br br perhaps weird al isn't recognized as the insightful cultural commentator that he is perhaps a rose by any other name would smell just as sweet still this is a funny movie
a girl's folly is a sort of half comedy half mockumentary look at the motion picture business of the mid 1910's we get a glimpse of life at an early movie studio where we experience assembly of a set running through a scene handling of adoring movie fanatics even lunch at the commissary we are also privy to little known cinematic facts for example did you know that frequently 'movie' actors do not know the plot of the picture in which they are working br br the plot of this film in essence is movie star kenneth driscoll's discovery and romancing of a budding young starlet whom he discovers while shooting on location in the country i believe the 30 minute version i watched was abridged included on the same tape with cecil b de mille's the cheat it is a very credible film an easy watch with a large cast of extras as a bonus it includes some of best illustrated captions i have ever seen accompanying a silent movie
definitely one of the lesser of the astaire rogers musicals it's just very poorly plotted and paced it only runs a few minutes longer than swing time for example but it feels a heck of a lot longer this is partly due to the secondary romance between randolph scott and harriet hilliard scott is rarely ever interesting i like hilliard she's sweet and i love at least one of her songs but where are you get thee behind me satan her other number is a weak leftover from top hat thankfully cut from that masterpiece follow the fleet would actually be a bad film if not for at least three brilliant dance sequences between astaire and rogers the dancing contest vies for the top spot of any of their numbers the dance is just fantastic i'm putting all my eggs in one basket presents the two rehearsing a dance that they don't quite have perfected yet its imperfections make it all the more perfect and let's face the music and dance is easily one of irving berlin's best songs so the film is well worth watching for its great moments
ah the 1970's a time when it was in to be a swinger to be honest today is also a good time to be a swinger but it just felt more daring then br br joe sarno offers up a pretty good soft core film in fact just like today some of the actors are famous hardcore actors unlike today these people were good actors and these films had a plot and character development br br it's pretty much what you would expect out of a swinger's movie two couples with open relationships re ignite the wanderlust out of the milf of one of the women who has come for a visit not much more to it br br of course when the milf is jennifer welles then it is a different story not too many 40 somethings look as delicious undressed as ms welles it's worth the price alone to see ms welles look at herself in the mirror as if she's aphrodite she's no stifler's mom she's way sexier br br i also digged chris jordan's anna jordan looks and sounds so much like elaine joyce that i thought she might be her separated at birth twin or even elaine herself anna is always eating but must have incredible metabolism br br unlike 1990's soft core porn 70's softie porn retained the hardcore film's realism something that 2000's soft core has brought back on occasion instead of the 90's music and canned orgasms and it is here in full force it's not real but it feels real br br for those who enjoyed the quebec produced deux femmes en or you'll enjoy this one another classic film only on drive in classics the best 2 50 can a month you can spend
one can only hope that there are many times when someone as powerful as morgan freeman can take the time to assist someone who needs help br br it all comes down to loving people as will rogers said i never met a man i didn't like of course if you meet paz vega what's not to like that smile of hers can melt diamonds she is just so fantastic that i can watch anything she is in the same goes for freeman he is just magic on the screen br br the two of them gave us a film that was funny from start to finish from the mexican supermarket to lorraine bobby to packy it was tender charming and just plain funny br br you have to check this out
ok the cons first the obligatory '70's alligator all right correction caiman with nonmoving limbs is made the worse for scale miniature underwater shots with the full length of reptile comparative to the size of the boat utilizing a toy alligator being swirled around the toy boat in broadly lit water even for nighttime shots br br unlike most primitives killing exploitative westerners films the superstitious natives going bat and start massacring the vacationers seems unjustified this time no one really abused the natives exploited yes but far from abusive treatment after all it was one of the natives canoodling with a spoiled supermodel during a taboo full moon that brought the curse of the river demon on them right br br the vacationers are easily annoying with the notable exception of the token old soul mildly blasphemous little girl who takes a shine to the heroes that you often see in 70's euroflicks but far from from deserving violent death unless they were your next door neighbors mind you a couple actually get killed being heroic notable in that none of them fill the role of sidekick there are only two straight villains in the entire film so the demises feel more arbitrary than cathartic br br the sequence where the giant caiman crunches down and scarfs thirty tourists in under five minutes will probably strike you as unintentionally hilarious br br the point at which the natives decide not to wipe the surviving westerners and practically saying hey you aren't so bad after all sorry about that fuss last night because they blew up the monster lizard has you shaking your head as the corny music kicks in you know the local military dictatorship will wipe out the village for ing with the tourist trade after the credits roll br br the pros barbara bach barbara bach barbara bach barbara bach you all know why you're interested in this film in the first place right i thought so if you're a bach completist get the dvd reissued by noshame films earlier this year digitally remastered with no real extras to speak of aside from the director bemoaning the current state of international film distribution br br the hero isn't half bad being far from an idiot always a plus in b films and the cynical little kid provides most of the comic relief br br worth a look but get it cheaply
an enthralling wonderful look at the films that inspired the excellent martin scorsese many of the films he speaks of are easy to relate to his works particularly the earlier ones the silent era very enjoyable despite being a bit long i found this to be one of the best documentaries on film yet required viewing if you admire martin scorsese and his work
as predictable as a hallmark card but not without merit the rookie makes for a solid outing dennis quaid the most reasonable jock actor working today is absolutely perfect as the science teacher turned baseball player jimmy morris the film is never dumbed down for the children as would be expected from a g rated film as a sports film the rookie is one of the best i have seen since any given sunday
bizarre tobe hooper exercise regarding an unfortunate young man brad dourif with the ability to set people on fire this ability stems from parents who partook in atomic experiments in the 50's they die of spontaneous human combustion and it seems that what sam is beginning to suffer from derives by these pills his girlfriend lisa cynthia bain gives him to take for rough migraines in actuality lisa was told to manipulate sam into taking the pills by lew orlander william prince pretty much the young man's father who raised him from a child lew has benevolent plans he sees sam as the first atomic man a pure killing machine in human form sam never wanted this and will do whatever it takes to silence those responsible for his condition as the film goes sam's blood is slowly growing toxic green in color instead of red it seems that water and other substances which often put out fire react right the opposite when sam's uncontrollable outbursts of flame ignite come to find out lisa has sam's condition whose parents also dies from shc dr marsh jon cypher someone who sam has known for quite some time as his physician is to insert toxic green fluid into their bodies i'm guessing to increase their levels of flame nina melinda dillon sporting an accent that fades in and out was sam's parents' friend and associate on the experiments in the 50's who tries to talk things over with him regarding what is happening and rachel dey young is sam's ex wife who may be working against her former husband with lew and marsh to harm him and lisa br br quite a strange little horror flick filled with some pretty awful flame effects dourif tries to bring a tragic element and intensity to his character whose plight we continue to watch as his body slowly becomes toxic waste with fire often igniting from his orifices there's this large hole in his arm that spits out flame like a volcano and a massive burn spot on his hand which increases in size over time best scene is probably when director john landis who portrays a rude electrical engineer trying to inform sam to hang up because the radio program he's calling has sounded off for the night becomes a victim of shc the flick never quite works because it's so wildly uneven with an abrupt ridiculous finale where sam offers to free lisa of her fire by taking it from her
i'm a true fan of the original cracker series and own all of them on dvd cracker had a tendency to be over the top on occasion but robbie coltrane and the other cast members as well as the writers always seemed to carry it off despite themselves i count the original cracker among the great brit tv crime series of that time and there's some stiff competition prime suspect inspector frost inspector morse jeremy brett's sherlock homes and a host of others cracker along with prime suspect was on the top of my list br br which makes a new terror all the more sad br br ultimately this was a very pale imitation of cracker's former glory i forced myself to sit through the whole thing convinced that it couldn't actually be this bad and that some spark would eventually ignite i was wrong it was bad from beginning to end br br a few criticisms first just to get any potential bias up front right off i was offended by the anti american anti war screed that droned on and on throughout most of the show the topper the murder of two american's innocent of any crime and a british junkie is in fitz's words understandable but not justified i thought i waded through two hours of crap just to hear this disgusting bit of drivel so i had a negative reaction to the anti war american tone brought on by my beliefs beyond the politics i had the distinct sense that this cracker was merely a prop for the propaganda and it actually helped to undermine an already terribly weak script br br second just how much air time did robbie coltrane get fitz was almost a bit player in this one as if he was an afterthought plugged into some story originally written without any thought of fitz's role coltrane could have carried the show on his own broad and still suitably flabby shoulders but the writer was apparently thinking of other things and missed the chance and by a wide margin br br third what an abysmal script there was some sparkle and a couple of bits of actual character development fitz's son ranting that fitz couldn't stay at his house if he missed his plane to australia the detective that liked to beat his poor performers over the backs of their heads and some of the old sparks between fitz and his missus but not nearly enough to carry the tedious storyline br br fourth where the hell was panhallagan now that would have been interesting it was manchester after all and 10 years on she'd be up in the ranks another wasted opportunity or perhaps the actress wasn't interested br br well there's much more that's bad to say but i'll close with a curiosity at the end of the show as it aired on bbca when the advertisement announced that the director's cut was available on bbc on demand i thought ah ha the director's cut which presumably one has to pay for might have all of the goodies i expected to see tonight but never did like a coherent interesting storyline unfortunately after convincing myself to sit through the horrible free version of a new terror with the hope of seeing something anything worth watching only to be disappointed i have no hope left to motivate me to actually pay for a second potentially longer and more tedious version besides it angered me to think that bbca sliced and diced and sacrificed show time to accommodate the endless every ten minutes or so stream of commercials and then turned around and asked me to pay for what probably should have been version aired tonight br br to close i quote the first paragraph of variety's review of a new terror it really says it all initial excitement about robbie coltrane reprising his role as the bbc's flawed boozing womanizing criminal psychologist is snowed under by the heavy handed political statement writer jimmy mcgovern is determined to deliver within this revival vidpic jolting at first in its message namely that americans are a bunch of whiny namby pambies who didn't care a whit about terrorism before it came crashing onto our doorstep mcgovern's chest clearing rant overwhelms the narrative and mutes the pleasure of seeing fitz back on the case
this movie had some great actors in it unfortunately they had forgotten how to act i was hoping the movie would get better as it went along but the acting was so robotic it was doomed from the very start it actually appeared that maybe the actors were reading from a script the whole time maybe it was the musical score or the director himself but one thing is for sure the make up artist needs to get another job the facial powder was so thick you could see it caked on the actors faces would not recommend this movie to anyone no wonder it never hit the theaters cuba gooding jr james woods shame on you guys for not giving it your all the plot was great just needed a whole lot more
this is one of my favorite films of all time al pacino acting is at its best and the story is excellent too bad it didn't do to well in the 80's when it was first released because people didn't get a chance to experience this classic
there is a lot of obvious hype associated with this film let's just face it though the main reasons why anyone would watch it would be for leo and cate who are not necessarily the best actors in this film i'm not saying they're not good actors i'm saying they stunk in this film the special effects were decent and i will say the film makers did a good job making the ship eye pleasing but it even has several major flaws for instance right before the ship goes under you can see an unfinished blue screen image behind your main characters br br don't get me wrong i love the story of the real titanic but i find this movie an insult to that story editing was atrocious there's no reason for any film to be over 2 1 2 hours with the exception of maybe a biographical movie and the writing and screenplay was horribly stilted br br i will say that the music was perhaps better than i could have predicted and not just the my heart will go on song either there is one scene that stands out to me when the ship is sinking and pounding bass music is heard that could very well be the highlight of the film as for the mood throughout it was extremely dull i was more relieved than sad when jack died which i know cannot be what the director intended br br in a nut shell i find it horrible that they turned the beautiful story of the titanic into an over hyped chick flick
leave it to braik to put on a good show finally he and zorak are living their own lives outside of spac ghost coast to coast i have to say that i love both of these shows a whole lot they are completely what started adult swim brak made it big with an album that came out in the year 2000 it may not have been platinum but his show was really popular to tons of people out there that love adult swims shows i have to say that out of all the adult swim shows with no plot this has to be the one with the most none plot ever made that is why i like it so much it is just such a classic in the adult swim history i believe this is just such a great show if you don't like it hey there were tons who hated it and tons who loved it
the problem with the contracter is summed up by the opening scene the cia want an international terrorist dead so contact black ops assassin james dial the terrorist is appearing at the old bailey court in london which begs the question why do they want to bump off a terrorist if he's going to spend the rest of his life in jail he's going to be out of circulation either way didn't the cia have a chance before he was arrested if by some chance he gets a not guilty verdict then kill him there's no logical reason to kill someone who is going to spend life in a maximum security prison br br since the premise sets up the story an audience might be choose to ignore the plot hole but the assination itself pours fuel upon the fire dial's colleague is killed by a police bullet and the taxi they're driving in crashes but dial manages to escape so the police were close enough to shoot someone but too far away to apprehend someone from a car crash the film of this type of plot connivance later dial finds a police inspector pointing a gun at him saying this airport is surrounded by armed coppers yet dial manages to escape very easily without explanation the whole film cheats its audience by relying on things that are never explained this includes an important supporting character called emily day why does she help dial even though he's a wanted fugitive your guess is as good as mine br br this is a fairly poor thriller and don't be taken in by the big name cast wesley snipes used to qualify as a film star but killed his career by starring in more and more inconsequental films charles dance also appeared in big budget hollywood productions such as last action hero and alien 3 but again he's someone best known for appearing in straight to dvd fare these days and he's basically playing a cameo role anyway the likes of lena headey may go on to become big players in cinema but they'l certainly fail to put the contracter on their resume
the story for hare rama hare krishna actually came to dev anand's mind when he saw hippies and their fallen values in kathmandu where he was on a visit after the protests against his previous prem pujari in calcutta he was low in spirits because his film had been opposed and some had burnt prem pujari's posters but the life of hippies re ignited a story in dev's mind to be made into a film br br this was dev anand's perhaps best directorial effort the film was a blockbuster super hit at the box office and zeenat aman as dev's sister made a tremendous impact br br this film was dev anand's call to the nation to keep up their moral values br br it is about a montereal based indian family and the brother's role is a very affectionate one for his sister but the parents quarrel and separate leaving prashant dev with mother and jasbir zeenat with father she is repeatedly told that her mother and brother are dead and she eventually believes that she will never see prashant again br br she is ill treated by her step mother and she runs away from home dev grows up to be a pilot and he learns that jasbir is in kathmandu with certain hippies br br to reunite with his sister dev travels to kathmandu and meets shanti mumtaz who was to later marry him and also janice who in reality is jasbir with a new name and new identity she has forgotten her childhood and dev too br br dev has to get his sister back amongst all other happenings which include his being suspected as a thief in kathmandu and the people are after his life br br this was a story well directed and acted both by dev anand we see more of zeenat aman than of mumtaz but the music by rahul dev burman was well composed dev had first offered the music to be composed by sachin dev burman but burman da did not want dev to do the film he was very close to dev and his earlier film prem pujari though was good but had been opposed in calcutta burman da wanted dev to try a lighter subject as he thought hippie cultist film might reignite people's anger against dev but dev continued with the film reassuring burman da and the film was indeed a success br br r d burman had asha bhosle sing the award winning dum maro dum kanchi re kanchi re was another good number br br overall it is a good film
i love these actors but they were wasted in this flick br br i can only wonder what were they thinking agreeing to this crap br br debra winger just phoned it in dennis quaid and arliss howard were caricatures some people thought it was deep well if you liked breaking the waves you'll probably like this too i hated both 3 10
this movie has everything that makes a bad movie worth watching sloppy editing little to no continuity insane dialog bad you might even say non existent acting pointless story lines shots that go on far too long and it's perfect for mst3k style riffing not to mention the corpse eaters drinking game scribble on forms take a shot sign your name take a shot catch a bad foley edit take many many shots br br the only reason i didn't rate it higher than 8 is because there's not enough gratuitous nudity and because despite its insane badness it's only an hour long hell a movie like this should have been at least 20 30 minutes longer
i'm not even sure what to say about this film it's one of only a handful of movies ever made that i would consider romantic to try to talk plot or performance or technical details about this film would be in the words of frank zappa like dancing about architecture it absolutely hits the nail right on the head in the way it captures those fleeting moments in life that move us and then run away from us never to be experienced again this seems like the movie the character version of charlie kaufman in the movie adaptation wanted to write the ending is left open and ambiguous no happy ending here just mystery no profound life lessons just a couple of horny and intelligent kids exploring the ability to feel the most irrational and unrealistic of feelings romantic love br br 10 out of 10 watch it with your special lady and recommend it to a stranger
besides being boring the scenes were oppressive and dark the movie tried to portray some kind of moral but fell flat with its message what were the redeeming qualities on top of that i don't think it could make librarians look any more unglamorous than it did
this is an interesting idea gone bad the hidden meanings in art left as clues by a serial killer sounds intriguing but the execution in anamorph is excruciatingly slow and without much interest there is no other way to describe the film except boring the death clues are the only interesting part of anamorph everything connecting them is tedious willem dafoe gives a credible performance as the investigator but he has little to do with a script that is stretched to the limit several supporting character actors are wasted including peter stormare as the art expert james rebhorn as the police chief paul lazar as the medical examiner and most notably deborah harry who is featured on the back of the dvd case yet only has a couple lines spoken through a cracked door not recommended merk
i understand this film to be a debut feature and as such it is very impressive it has the feel and pacing of a true indie yet director todd yellin clearly possesses the photographic and editorial vision command and judgment of a mature and seasoned professional the shots are well framed and thought out and serve to move the story forward he and screenwriter ivan solomon deliver a story that has much more depth and lyricism than typical paint by numbers type scripts it's a story that needs judd hirsch caliber character talent to have a shot at working judd is fantastic as usual as are scott cohen and the beautiful susan floyd the real surprise though is elliot korte who plays adam groden yellin was able to coax nuance out of the young actor in a role that could have been easily devalued by stereotype or overreach anyway i found the film refreshing and entertaining
okay let's not get confused here if this is a sequel to a remake of an original horror classic does that mean it also automatically is a remake of the original horror classic's sequel here's to hoping that's not a general rule as wes craven's own sequel to the original the hills have eyes  released somewhere during the mid 80's  is easily one of the worst and absolute most redundant horror movies ever made part two didn't have an actual plot and re used footage of the original only to further exploit the success of the genuinely gritty and petrifying premise craven also wanted us to believe even dogs suffer from flashbacks and painful memories as the loyal german shepard of the carter family re experienced his bloody fight with one of the mountain hillbillies there were quite a bit of alarming signs indicating us that this sequel would be a horrendous failure as well the remake came out barely one year ago and here's the sequel already the incredible speed of its release righteously causes you to question the quality of the script don't they need a little more time if they want to come up with a film that should be scary menacing and disturbing with his excellent film alexandre aja nearly single handedly altered the general opinion about horror remakes as he had the courage and intellect of changing essential elements in the plot and adding more nauseating gore than anyone could ever had hoped for also aja is quite a talented young director and made himself noticed with his french instant cult classic high tension but who is this new director aja's the hills have eyes was an unexpected hit appreciated by both experienced and older generations of horror fans as well as the younger and over enthusiast target groups it's a really good film and even though an avalanche of new sequels and clones will be inevitable it's highly unlikely that one of them will ever equal the surprising quality level of aja's smashing hit bearing all this in mind plus a rather large dose of personal skepticism i must admit this rushed sequel really isn't as awful as anticipated the screenplay is routine and clichéd horror fodder introducing a fairly large number of characters with few or even no backbone and tastelessly depicting how they get slaughtered by traditionally repulsive looking freaks after the events of the first film the us army has set up a camp in the middle of the new mexican desert to investigate the effects of the nuclear tests which took place there in the 50's and 60's for the horribly mutated survivors of the miner's community that stayed there during the radioactive testing the scientists and researchers form a tasty starter until the main course of incompetent soldiers arrives by truck they are just supposed to drop off food and supplies but encounter their ultimate military training exercise when faced with the relentless humanoids that live inside the remainders of the mines br br this basically is just another by the numbers slasher with dumb characters who are even after losing several of their friends already still stupid enough to separate themselves from the group and act like easy targets to kill it's also very easy to point out which ones will make it out of this adventure alive especially when one of the soldiers is against all types of violence and another one continuously stares at video images of her cute 3 year old son the hills have eyes ii completely lacks  as to be expected  originality logic and plausible situations the mutated miners aren't nearly as menacing as their colleagues in part one mainly because they aren't organized this time and only just behave like drooling and sex hungry prototype monsters since you don't care for the amateur g i joe heroes and definitely don't feel any sympathy for the eyes in the hills this film is a whole lot less compelling and involving than last year's original most peculiarly this second film isn't nearly as violent and gory as the first sequels usually compensate the lack of suspense and the absence of surprise twists with extra bloodshed and more graphic killing sequences but the action in this sequel is really tame compared to the sick footage featuring in its predecessor there are a handful of scenes to satisfy the bloodthirsty horror fanatics  mainly showing soldiers falling down cliffs or getting shot by their own guns  but there sadly aren't any outrageous pick axe battles or virulent dog attacks what a shame what's the point of a sequel if it even fails to surpass the level of grossness and or gratuitous filth of the original luckily enough the film is never boring or unnecessarily sentimental and you'll have the most fun spotting all the things that don't make the slightest bit of sense for example wallets falling out of people's bloodied heads women without any muscle power cast as tough ass soldiers and  my personal favorite  assigning the one soldier with a speaking disability to operate the radio communications
what happened to peter bogdanovich once a brilliant director a trail blazer is now scraping the very bottom is this the same man who directed the last picture show here he takes a somewhat interesting albeit farfetched premise and turns it into bubble gum that loses flavor the moment you take the first bite dunst is not bad but izzard is miscast as chaplin and all the other actors seem to have been cast for their looks and not because they were right for the part too bad i'll go rent paper moon again
what a horrible horrible film the worst collection of cliches i have seen in a long time not that i saw much i left the theatre screaming after about 40 minutes in search of a stiff drink to soothe my nerves meryl streep was awful as usual how many hurt and tortured expressions can 1 person have aidan quinn's talents were as so often totally wasted and who told gloria estefan she could act trying to be polically correct this movie still enforces racial stereotypes brave inexperienced lonely music teacher teaches underprivilegded kids violin in poor neighbourhood school the kids weren't even cute just written in to suit the appalling script aaargh wes craven really made me cringe for once real horror this one
i saw this film for the first time not too long on tcm's essentials series the eye of the beholder cliché was never more apropos this beholder saw little of value in this one i was puzzled by the infinite attraction that lucy lauren bacall possessed granted ms bacall was a beautiful woman but in this film her character comes off more mousy than attractive i would think men like mitch wayne and kyle hadley would more likely ignore lucy than fall into an instant infatuation with her in bacall's defense this film was made at the time of humphrey bogart's last illness and the weight of his deteriorating health may have affected her performance of course part of this mousiness on the part of lucy was to contrast her to slutty marylee played to the hilt and beyond by dorothy malone the scene where she engages in a wildly sensual dance while her father wearily climbs the stairs to a fatal heart attack is far and away the best scene in the film malone's performance outshines the rest although jasper hadley's weariness at the disappointing behavior of his two children is brilliantly portrayed by robert keith generally though i would have to say that i'm just not much of a fan of melodrama the cartoonish behavior of the characters just makes for a story too implausible for my tastes
so much is wrong with this abysmal little wet fart of a movie that it's hard to know where to begin br br first of all it's a remarkably un scary scary movie even by amercian standards the dialogue is cliché the characters are two dimensional the writing is ho hum and what little story there is is neither coherent nor remotely interesting br br we meet the following stereotypes in order balding loser guy probably divorced but who knows this movie doesn't tell us with a brave heart the young hero who doesn't do anything heroic at all brave little kid with a homicidal streak a mile wide and black bad ass bitch with more brawn than brains these guys take up an ongoing fight with the tall scary reaper man and his evil ewoks br br oh and the film is full of wicked little metal orbs whoosing around menacing people given a chance they perform impromptu brain surgery on those who doen't have the mental acuity to duck when they come at them booh actually one of them is haunted by a good ghost but then again it might be a deceitful spectre who seems intent on helping our brave contagonists retrieve their young kidnapped friend br br there is no character background or even an introduction to any of the characters it starts with some kind of recap of the ending of the previous movie but this doesn't explain a lot if you've seen the first two movies fine otherwise you don't know who these people are how they are related why they aren't in school or at work or why you should care whether they live or die consequently you don't the only point of interest becomes any splatter effects and there aren't enough of those to keep you awake br br of potenial interest amusement are the three raider punks as stupid as they are evil who menace our heroes but they don't get much screen time they are offed almost immediately then they are buried why anybody should take the time is beyond me then they appear again as evil raider punk zombies only to be offed again literally within a minute br br the rest of the movie mainly seems to consist of caspar the friendly ghost appearing and disappearing driving around looking for places and balding loser trying to score som bad black bitch booty using pickup lines that would embarrass a mentally retarded teenager no dice there not even some gratuitous sex could have saved this movie so good thing there never is any br br the head baddie called the tall man doesn't manage to scare anyone older than 3 years howling booooy every five minutes isn't enough why he with his amazing telekinetic powers and uncanny upper body strength doesn't simply squash our heroes like bugs isn't explained instead he delegates the job to his inept retarded little minions who never manage to kill anyone before being shot to hell br br filmgoers who like masterpieces like friday 13th part xxxxviii jason goes to college might find some entertainment the rest of us who have developed pubic hair will be bored out of our skulls
no matter how well meaning his message is this film is a terribly made trainwreck awful acting lame camera work i do not know why carr agreed to try and pull off a stutter he is lousy at it you watch the extras on the dvd and the way he has a camera follow him around he just soaks it up he loves being the center of attention he is a bad actor he reminds me of another arrogant filmmaker eric schaffer some how carr has had this film shown at city youth centers and new age churches where damaged people looking for reinforcement and attention themselves babble on about how the film touched them and maybe it did but as a film itself it is choppy predictable and sappy
i've seen a lot of seagal movies and while most aren't great or even good this steamy pile lowered the bar for bad movies br br the plot not sure really something about a drug that makes you all crazy and strong or something who are the good guys and bad guys hard to tell most of the movie is cut scenes going back and forth between people in darkly lit rooms complaining about how good seagals character mashall is br br acting blows br br voice dubbing what was with the horrible voice overdubbing could they of found anyone who sounded any less like seagal may as well had cheech or chong doing the voice overs might of at least been entertaining then br br this movie is boring and completely stupid avoid it at all costs
penny princess finds american working girl yolande donlon the inheritor of a small kingdom that lies in that triangle where france italy and switzerland meet called lampidorra it seems as though the lampidorrans owe bills all over europe and the main occupation of the country is smuggling due to its geography an american multi millionaire buys the place but dies before he can take title his nearest heir is donlan br br but of course the estate has to go through probate in america and what are the lampidorrans to do especially since donlan who has now become a princess has forbade smuggling br br enter dirk bogarde who is on a trip to switzerland to learn about the cheese industry it seems as though the lampidorrans have a kind of cheese that they playfully refer to as schmeeze with a few bumps in the road schmeeze solves all the problems both financial geopolitical and romantic between donlan and bogarde br br how does schmeeze work well that's the gimmick to the whole film but here's a hint in lover come back jack kruschen might just have gotten a hold of the secret of schmeeze when he was busy inventing vip for rock hudson and his advertising agency br br anyway penny princess is a delightful blend of british farce and romantic comedy yolande donlon once again plays a role that marilyn monroe would have been cast in if the film had been made this side of the pond dirk bogarde was well cast in the part which was at the beginning of his career as a romantic heart throb way before anyone but him suspected he had the acting chops he had br br this film was sadly shown at three o'clock in the morning on tcm but at least i found a reason to be grateful for insomnia
well i couldn't even enjoyed this movie much for its cult values it's a b movie action flick by the director of commando that is however far too lame and silly to consider it a good b movie with enough entertainment value in it br br it's an '90's flick but foremost the movie should remind of an '80's action movie when these type of b movies were at an all time high these movies always went over the top and never paid much attention to its story or acting it was all about blowing stuff up big muscle heroes and bullets flying around this movie has all of that ingredients in it but yet i really didn't liked watching this movie as much as i like watching some similar type of movies hard to say why really since the story and acting and such are just as bad as would be the case in basically any other genre movie from the same era br br it's probably because the movie is being often far too silly all these type of movies have its silly moments but this movie is just filled with it the fighting dolph lundgren running around shirtless the characters the story it all just isn't very good because it's often just too lame for words the story at times isn't even trying to make a bit sense and what's even the main plot line of the overall movie its story is all over the place really and seems only to be written to create a movie out of with fighting sequences gun fights and such and those sequences aren't even much good to watch really the moments are way too short and quite disappointing to watch really from the man who brought us commando br br it's foremost a dolph lundgren in which he gets to play the big action hero star who kicks butt with seemingly relative ease knows how to handle guns and other weapons and of course also gets the girl played by tia carrere this all also brings us one of the worst montage sequence in action movie history and also definitely one of the worst sex sequence i have seen in any movie really both are just too lame for words and just very poorly put together br br none of the characters work out really the good guys are cops but they never seem to behave like one they simply kill around without having to face responsibility to anyone and they are not very keen on making any arrest or to inform anyone about their discoveries not even when they find out a big japanese crime syndicate is trying to take over the streets of l a and a beer brewery is working as a cover for a drugs factory and large scale drugs smuggling and also just think about it for a moment what is brandon lee's overall purpose in the movie the movie could had easily done without him and the girl as well br br too silly lame and simplistic and just not entertaining enough br br 4 10
i guess i have still enough brain left to not find this movie funny great comedians but a very poor movie the best performance still did nina hagen br br trivia did you realize that it the real world scenes in hamburg the cars are almost only new bmws br br i guess i have still enough brain left to not find this movie funny great comedians but a very poor movie the best performance still did nina hagen br br trivia did you realize that it the real world scenes in hamburg the cars are almost only new bmws
whatever rating i give boom is only because of the superb location photography of sardinia and rome otherwise this is only for hardcore addicts of elizabeth taylor her downward phase and richard burton his miscasting phase tennessee williams wrote the milk train doesn't stop here anymore and is supposed to be very fond of this adaptation of his play but apparently he was the only one taylor reportedly hated it and burton needed the money br br whatever it amounts to a hill of beans with taylor posturing and fuming in her shrill manner exploding at the servants and exchanging bad baby talk with no less than noel coward who seems to be a visitor from another film when he finally appears br br it's so campy that among taylor fans it's probably considered a must see kind of thing but if you can sit through this one without a drink in your hand you're way ahead of me sadly this is the film that signified the end of taylor being taken seriously as a film actress even after winning two oscars for burton it was equally disastrous and the critics called it a bomb judge for yourself if you dare
on broadway a chorus line was pure magic from the second the show opened with a spectacular burst of energy to the truly grand finale a joyous curtain call of all those chorus members who we grew to love during the course of the show we were totally engaged captivated by the intensely personal stories some funny some clever some stirring of this chorus line the movie is another matter entirely the focus is now on the director and what an ogre he is every time the film switches to michael douglas there he is with a bitter sour expression barking out questions and orders screaming and yelling whenever he gets the chance yikes that changes the dynamics of the story on broadway the director was indeed an imperious offstage presence but he was also sort of a theatrical device to allow the stories of these amazing strong fragile intriguing hilarious chorus line members to be told with insight and clarity there is a reason this work won the pulitzer prize and actually in one of the only moments the director appears he is there to comfort the young puerto rican dancer after we hear that dancer's heart breaking story he appears again to ultimately express his genuine affection concern for cassie but in the movie from the second douglas' director starts bitterly barking orders the chorus line members' stories become secondary it's like they are in a lousy profession where a jaded director instead of showing the joy at creating a new exciting theatrical show is jaded exhausted furious at having to audition these chorus members on stage there was always the excitement of the show here in the movie practically from the word go you feel sorry for everyone involved during the course of the musical we desperately wished every single one of those chorus members well and how happy we would have been if they had all gotten the job but of course that couldn't happen but in the finale when they all came back in glorious costume with those amazing spinning mirrors on stage sometimes reflecting us in the audience in our hearts and we know also in the hearts of all those chorus members both accepted and rejected they were on stage forever dancing in a profession they loved so much bringing magic to the theatre in the movie after all the misplaced story lines and emphasis that magic becomes totally diluted all we feel even with the exact same curtain call is that some of the members got a job with a mean spirited director so they all come on the screen and are dancing again big deal
and that's a bad thing because at least if this had been a troma film it would have had wanton violence and a greater sense of anarchic abandon that might have brought my rating up a bit br br so what we have instead is a very tame rated pg barely lukewarm low budget roger corman produced it with an unknown director who has subsequently remained unknown gremlins 1984 critters 1986 wannabe with almost exclusively flat humor little of the logic that made gremlins work so well fantasy logic or not no suspense no sense of adventure and no violence or nudity to make up for it br br although i'm sure some of the problems with the film are inherent in the script let's face it no one could deliver these jokes so that they would be funny it seems like the biggest blame has to fall into the lap of the director bettina hirsch in more capable hands munchies could have been entertaining br br after all it starts out like many great adventure films simon waterman harvey korman and his son paul charles stratton are in peru on an archaeological dig simon is a bit of a wacky archaeologist who is always floating theories about the connections between ancient sites and alien civilizations for example he thinks he sees evidence of laser cutting on ancient stonework so they're at machu picchu looking for more evidence of simon's theories when they happen upon a secret chamber inside they quickly find the animal they later dub arnold one of the titular munchies br br they take arnold back home to their small california desert town simon who thinks that arnold is probably an alien creature has to go off to a colleague's lecture and he plans on telling the colleague that he finally has an alien specimen paul and his extremely cute girlfriend cindy nadine van der velde are left in charge of arnold but as they haven't seen each other in a long time they leave arnold unsupervised while they hop in the sack br br meanwhile simon's brother cecil played also by korman in a dual role owner of a successful snack foods company is eager to buy off simon's home and land they're adjacent to his own simon doesn't want to sell so cecil hits upon a scheme to steal arnold things gradually spiral out of control and the munchies who have a mean streak to go along with their cravings for junk food begin to overrun the town br br that reads better in a summary than it plays on the screen the best shots in the film are those with natural landscapes in the background such as when characters are driving on the outskirts of the desert town interiors with the exception of cecil's home tend to look like poorly decorated cheap sets and more importantly they tend to show that hirsch is not very skilled at blocking and setting up shots oddly given the paucity of the production design overall cecil's home is quite a gem imbued as it is in overblown 1980s style down to the smallest details and cecil's stepson dude jon stafford was an amusing counterpoint too bad then that he's out of the film so quickly br br at any rate korman is a fun actor but he comes across much better here as simon than as cecil unfortunately simon ends up being absent for most of the film cecil who is differentiated physically by a ridiculous wig and facial hair is not only the evil capitalist of the film he's one of korman's classic inconsiderate boorish characters that was one of his specialties frequently capitalized on in carol burnett show 1967 skits unlike the carol burnett show which tended to succeed because directors clark jones and dave powers had a studied way of pushing the skits just to the brink of chaos hirsch reins korman in way too far and the cecil character just doesn't work the way it should br br there are a lot of other director related problems not the least of which is wonky pacing and editing which completely sap any possible suspense or compelling dramatic impact from the film even scenes that should have been shoe ins for amping up the drama such as when the munchies are harassing an old lady on the road are put together far too awkwardly to have much affect br br there are also serious logical problems with the story as it stands where did the munchie in the chamber at machu picchu come from the film's trailer seems to show an answer to this but it was edited out of the final cut a more serious problem is that unlike gremlins there is no clear reason for munchies to go from cute cuddly furballs to menacing monsters it just happens further because munchies was kept pg and the violence remains toned down when the creatures are in their monster phase they're never very threatening they're also easily dispatched at least temporarily br br admittedly the gist of the film isn't suspense horror compelling drama or any of that other stuff but humor it's intended more as a spoof of gremlins and the countless rip offs in its wake the only problem with that is that the film just isn't funny even though i chuckled a couple times a surprisingly high percentage of the jokes are bland clichés too much of the remaining material consists of non sequiturs given bad timing from hirsch it all just falls flat there was potential to make a film that while a spoof was both funny and frightening hilarious and disturbing cheesy and suspenseful all at the same time ala killer klowns from outer space 1988 too bad then that munchies comes nowhere near that
time travel is a fun concept and this film gives it a different slant i got a kick out of captain billingham one of the more down to earth characters who was just not having a good day ordinarily i don't choose to watch horror films but this is an exception good story excellent acting
this is one of the most beautiful films i have ever seen the footage is extraordinary mesmerizing at times it also received an oscar for best photography and deservedly so i have many movies in my film collection and several more i've seen besides them and not many of them are more beautifully or even equally as beautifully shot as this one br br it's unique and an overall great movie the cast is terrific and do a great job in portraying their characters we follow their destinies with devotion and get very emotionally attached to them along the way we also learn things about ourselves and our lives i think much of this film for what it represent and how it present it i warmly recommend it
lipstick is another glossy movie failure i am trying to think of one good thing that i could say about the movie and i am having trouble coming up with something i guess the red dress that margaux hemingway was wearing in the end of the movie was the best part the writing and the script was not the worst that i have ever encountered but it could have been a lot better lipstick was very pleasing to the eye to view the sets were very glossy and nice to look at the cast was okay i felt like anne bancroft's character was the only feasible character in the entire movie it was sad to see chris sarandon waste his time on this one
this western is done in a different manner than most others realism is the key here conchata farrell comes to wyoming to work for rip torn on his ranch how this is presented makes for a most interesting slice of americana i would have preferred to see this on the big screen rather than on tape but it's worth a look to see just how life was back in the real west cinematography is excellent solid 9 torn farrell excel in this movie
emma is my favourite jane austen novel emma is well meaning despite her flaws so readers can forgive and love her and the relationship she has with mr knightley which is warm familiar respectful but playful generating that warm fuzzy romantic excitement mr knightley is the perfect man and emma is as close as you could get in those times to an independent clever confident woman remember she is only 21 and was sure to have matured and grown out of her flaws who doesn't want to be emma who doesn't want to be told off by mr knightley this version of emma gives you no sense of the things that i love about emma i couldn't even finish watching it i just found it so awful i couldn't see that warm generous side of emma which drives the reader to love her the patience and warmth she shows to her father the closeness between her and mrs weston which demonstrates her willingness to put her friend's happiness above her own as she sacrifices the only equal companion in her household by forwarding miss taylors marriage mr woodhouse's character in this adaptation just appears bizarre rather than just quaint elderly and a bit trying br br this adaptation most importantly fails bring to life the relationship between mr knightley and emma their relationship is built on mutual respect and affection mr knightley is indulgent of emma's minor faults trusting that her intelligence and genuine care for others will never allow her to go terribly astray and emma looks up to him though playfully hiding this and continuing to use her own judgement the dressing down he gives her right at the beginning of the show completely overstates the argument between them and ruins all possibility of portraying the nature of their relationship as i've described above mr knightley is also insufficiently attractive to bring to life the sexual tension between the leads or to inspire any admiration from the female viewers br br really horrible i can't understand why anyone who truly like the novel emma could like it unless it miraculously redeems itself after the point i switched it off
i watched peter jackson version of lord of the rings when i was half way through reading the two towers and i thought it was absolutely brilliant br br at this time the animated version of the lord of the rings was released on dvd but i told myself that i will finish reading the two towers and return of kings before watching it as i thought it showed the whole of the trilogy br br so when i did finish the trilogy i went and brought the dvd which was a stupid idea because it was absolutely rubbish br br i was acturly bored 20 minutes in to it which was really strange because i love the book and i am shooked that the maker of this film could of even thought of fitting at least 1 and a half of the books in to a 2 hour 8 minute film br br none of the characters had any emotions when they were talking and they seemed to be reading it of a page even my favourite character who is gandalf did not seem interesting at all br br the animation was the only okay in parts of the film except for the orks they looked awful and aragorn and sam face br br i don't know way this film was released because there was not even a proper ending but maybe it was good that the maker ran out of money because the film couldn't of got any better br br i just hope that nobody judges the books by this film br br 3 10
billed as takashi miike's first family film by people who haven't seen zebraman presumably yokai daisenso takes things even further in the direction of family friendliness diluting the darkness and cynicism to create a grand fantasy fairy tale a young boy is chosen by fate to save the world from monsters and horrors of which they remain largely unaware the film is evidently bigger budget than anything else miike has done with lots of cgi to create fantasy world populated by odd creatures the yokai perhaps the lack of extreme content is a consequence of more nervous investors but i think it's probably just that he wanted to do something different he's really never been a one trick pony but often gets accused of it perhaps yokai is designed to silence those critics regardless it's a great project for miike to channel his boundless imagination and invention into br br there's a very cartoonish feel to the production evoking thoughts of miyazaki in places the yokai are based on an old series of comics that were in turned based on japanese folk tales which certainly influenced miyazaki as well particularly spirited away it must remembered that miike has nothing like the budget of a harry potter film to work with so the special effects aren't going to be seamless hollywood style work some blue screening is especially obvious some of the special effects are great though with some very well animated creatures a mix of cg stop motion and puppetry i think the little sock puppet that follows the hero around for much of the film was meant to look really cheap and is all the cuter for it the young lad who plays the hero of the film does a really good job it's so hard to find a pre teen who actually understands the concept of acting but 9 year old ryunosuke kamiki is a genuine talent i see he did voices in the last 2 miyazaki films chiaki kuriyama is delicious as the villainess of the piece though mai takahashi made an even greater impression as the pixie eared river princess yum yum those looking for another violent perverted gangster film aren't going to find what they're looking for in yokai but if you're a fan of miike because of his imagination and wit there's plenty to satisfy here and it has the added bonus that you can happily put it on whatever company you've got
as if the storyline wasn't depressing enough this movie shows cows being butchered graphically in a slaughterhouse for all of five minutes while the protagonist is narrating her early life as a butcher weird stuff then there's the core premise of the hero heroine who goes and cuts his dick off because a he's besot ten with at work says he would have gone with him if he was a girl is this person a psycho a masochist just a doomed queen who takes things too far and what sort of traumatic childhood did he have just that he didn't get adopted and had to live it out with nuns who at first loved him and then later hated him because he was unruly he tries to explain to us the reasons he did what he did but it's really really so hard to empathize such sad and unusual self destruction was it supposed to be funny what was it all about really
the second in the vacation series is easily the least enjoyable one as clark griswold wins a trip for the whole family to europe br br the tasteless below the belt humor that worked so well the first time around is practically nonexistent here that fault surely lies with director hackerling who's obviously nowhere near as good a director as harold ramis and a very uninspiring script that has only a handful of decent lines scattered around br br the cast does what they can chevy chase injects some form of life into the proceedings but it's simply not enough and the very funny eric idle is completely wasted in a small role as a very unlucky englishman some potentially hilarious moments aren't played out to their full potential and leave the viewer mostly aggravated all depictions of europeans are one dimensional and almost universally not funny at all like how the english are sooo polite br br apart from a few scenes there's hardly a laugh in sight and the ending turn this one into complete slapstick but if you're a chevy chase fan like myself the film is watchable but no more than that
i knew i was going to see this when i saw the first preview dennis quaid was one reason but the theme of holding on to your dreams speaks to me people talk about this as a movie for kids but i think it's a movie for baby boomers who are coming to terms with aging infirm parents our own mortality our kids growing up and leaving us and all the other things we never thought would happen to us br br the movie doesn't fall into the trap of tragedy it's about what living your dreams means when you have a real life br br quaid is too small for a pitcher but he makes it look good and rachel griffiths makes a small part as the wife into a thoughtful layered performance the camera work is slow and sweet when they put this movie together they left out anything that wasn't necessary very nice
this is an extremely silly and little seen film about slavery in the west indies and it stars puddy from the seinfeld show patrick warburton made his film debut in this contrived movie and he's noticeably slimmer here oliver reed got top billing but he's hardly in the film at all warburton plays a white slave and its funny to see all the young and horny wives of rich old men bidding on him because they all want to have sex with him eartha kitt plays an owner of a bordello and they're is so much nudity in the film if its not drunken orgies at the bordello then its the young wives having they're turn with him then of course towards the end the slaves revolt and there's the bloody standoff no real political message like the film burn but just another contrived plot device to move the story along incredibly they made a sequel and warburton and all the rest of the cast came back i hope they got paid a lot of dough because this first film is pretty bad the nudity keeps it watchable and warburton's lack of any accent make it at times laughable very bad film but i got to admit that i want to see the sequel
i love this tv series so much it contains animation that is interesting and beautiful i cant believe that they cut it off tv and also that i never found out whether cybersix and data7 die or not apparently they survive but i'm not sure cybersix was by far the best tv show ever i know its to late to hope they will start the series over again so i'm really glad i got to watch it i luved it so much 3 br br its about a women by the name of cybersix she is not human she goes by adrian sieldman a man teacher at a highschool now cybersix is actually a women she is just disguised as a man in the day by night cybersix patrols the city br br a guy by the name of von reichter is the one who created cybersix and once he finds put she is alive he uses everything he can to capture her br br if u have never watched it before u should totally download it it was the best tv show in the world why did they cut it off some people have issues but i'm glad i got to watch the 13 episodes
what a fun filled sexy movie they certainly don't make them like this anymore 4 sexy au pairs arrive in london and have all sorts of sexual misadventures the tone is oddly innocent as the considerable nudity evolves out of stock farcical situations rather than any overt sexual desire on the part of the characters it is only when the actresses accidentally lose their clothes that the male characters become rampant richard o' sullivan literally gets 'randi' sic the film certainly betrays the origins of the softcore feature as lying in the nudie cuties and naturism films of the old school my special interest in 'au pair girls' is that i am a huge fan of gabrielle drake if any actress has ever looked better naked she's slim but wonderfully curvy or clothed come to that i've loved her since the original run of ufo who else could carry off a purple wig i'll eat my hat
i love horror movies i can even appreciate most cheese face it 9 out of 10 horror films these days are cheese but this was just ridiculous terrible acting terrible writing completely hollow and unbelievable characters no meisner actors here and a total lack of sufficient body count i wish i could salvage the 79 minutes of my life i just wasted at least the crook brothers are aptly named the only good thing about the whole film was watching the alicia silverstone wanna be get punched in the face how this ever made it to sundance is completely baffling to me most of the plot was absolutely unrealistic even by slasher film standards i mean come on who would rush out to get a cheap earring 10 seconds after a creepy stalker guy just left their doorstep lame
this film concerns the story of eddy as mentioned in the title and his homecoming to old friends in a seaside community the plot involves the group of friends as it comes to light that eddy left as a means to deal with death of a friend in which he feels in some way responsible but this is inconsequential as the choices made in the production are extremely poor and not fully realized screenplays not always need be 'chatty' but they should at least assist the development of the story here one line attempts such as he just took off or i know you don't have love in heart just do fully evoke something worth the audience's time also whenever the writer feels at a loss to where to go to next he cuts to a music montage of the protagonist walking through fields to some indie mood music talk about trying to hard if you are interested in a good film the type that gives quality and substance over just style then this is not the film for you
this is a good movie although people unfamiliar with the modesty blaise comics and books may find it a little slow and lacking in action for the modesty fan the movie will be very enjoyable particularly because it is very faithful in its presentation of the modesty blaise history peter o'donnell is listed in the credits as creative consultant and the film makers must have actually paid attention to him as the plot follows quite closely the details that have been presented in the comic books over the years although the events have been recast to modern days the only thing that the true fan may find disappointing is that there is no willie garvin in the story this lack of willie is again just being faithful to the modesty blaise chronology since the movie takes place in the very early days of modesty's career alexandra staden makes a very believable young modesty who actually looks a lot like modesty is supposed to look a welcome change from the travesty of the monica vitti portrayal of modesty
i must say this movie has given me a dual personality i've been told again and again to shut up and start speaking like a normal person but it's very hard no not the wang did you find that disgusting and disrespectful well get in the mood for a lot more this movie is just filthy it's not a film to show your grand parents but you should show it to a teenager or some immature guy at your workplace anyway back to the voice mannerisms fortunately this site has some ladies man did anyone at the studio notice that there's supposed to be a apostrophe between the e and s so you can always have a fine little something to say to your boss or the cops i have a sheet in my wallet
at first i had the reaction a lot of people left with after seeing this that shots of fat people sunbathing etc were cheap shots in a way ok so he's doing diane arbus meets whatever but it wasn't long before i realized that this wasn't being done in a dehumanizing way as the images unfold i felt that the problem was entirely the audience's we are conditioned by hollywood and also movies from just about everywhere actually to feel that to watch people above a certain age behave in a sexual way is something unseemly something that ought not to be shown if this were all the film offered it would be a great deal however the story of the woman with the abusive boyfriend and his drunk friend really hits like a ton of bricks very eloquent storytelling incredible performances and to think the scene was improvised that blonde guy is a genius actor finally i want to contradict those who say this film is all about how pathetic all these people are the old man who is on the make with the woman who finally dances for him is completely an a ok character that breaks that mold so don't oversimplify the film by overlooking him yes his dog gets killed this ain't a rosy picture of the world but it's not completely hopeless anyway i felt really grateful to the filmmaker for making such a beautiful film all in all i wouldn't say each of the threads were as strong as the strongest but i say this movie basically kicks ass and would highly recommend it

as i watch this film it is interesting to see how much it marginalizes black men the film spends its time showing how powerless the most visible black man in it is save for an heroic moment for much of the film the other black men and dark skinned black women in the film are way in the background barely visible br br vanessa williams' character was strong and sympathetic the viewer can easily identify and sympathize with her there are also some fairly visible and three dimensional support characters who are light skinned and some white characters of some warmth and dignity but 99 of the black males in this film are nothing but invisible men voiceless shadows in the background of no consequence such a horrible flaw but anything but unusual in the mainstream media
this movies is the best movie to watch for comic book feel the sets costumes and the color are just so vivid it is just like stepping into a comic book this is the movie i think of when the mob is mentioned the suits the hats and the attitudes br br hoffman gives comic relief as mumbles and you can't help but feel sorry for madonna as she tries and fails to win tracy over this movie contains all the classic mob clichés burying people in concrete blowing up peoples cars tieing up the good guy and attempting to blow up his girlfriends house br br this movie is a classic in ever sense of the word even camera angels cry out comic book its so great to be able to go back to an older movie and see that someone knew how a comic should be made into a movie after seeing such mistakes as spawn and the hulk br br you have to see this movie
they probably should have called this movie the map because the majority of the whole stupid film is revolved around a map of a cemetery not to mention how many of the same boring shots of the map there are the only thing they show more than the map itself is the little beads of sweat that is constantly building up on the forehead of our main character this of course was the film makers way of showing us how incredibly tense things are getting up on the immortal hills cemetery come on now couldn't they have shown us just one of the death scenes we hear a whole lot about how everyone who is listed on the map is dropping like flies but we don't get to see anything some how i bury the living manged to keep my attention so i was fairly generous with the rating i gave it but i will not recommend this movie to anyone unless you have a deep fascination with maps or sweat i recommend renting a better i movie such as i spit on your grave or i drink your blood
moe and larry are newly henpecked husbands having married shemp's demanding sisters at his music studio shemp learns he will inherit a fortune if he marries someone himself br br husbands beware is a remake of 1947's brideless groom widely considered by many to be one of the best stooge films with shemp the remake contains most of the footage from that film the new scenes shot may 17 1955 include the storyline of moe and larry marrying shemp's sisters along with their cooking of a turkey laced with turpentine a few new scenes are tacked onto the end of the film as well a double for dee green was used if you blink you will miss the double's appearance br br husbands beware would have made for a good film with just the plot line of marrying the sisters budget considerations coupled with fewer bookings for two reel comedies influenced the decision to use older footage br br although completely new films were still being made by the stooges most of their releases by 1955 56 were made up of older films with a few new scenes tossed in husbands beware while one of these hybrids is watchable and entertaining we get to see most of brideless groom again and the new scenes are funny enough to get the viewer through the film this film is one of the last stooge comedies to feature new footage of shemp and it was released six weeks after his death br br 7 out of 10
this is a really stupid movie in that typical 80s genre action comedy conceptwise it resembles rush hour but completely lacks the action the laughs and the chemistry between the main characters of that movie let it be known that i enjoy jay leno as a stand up and as a talk show host but he just cannot act he is awful when he tries to act tough he barely manages to keep that trademark smirk off his face while saying his one liners which by the way aren't very funny and seeing him run even back then is not a pleasant sight in addition i have a feeling that pat morita at least by today's standards doesn't give a very politically correct impression of the japanese don't even get me started about the story i give it a 2 out of 10
this is one of the best movies i have seen in a long time all of you who regard this movie as absolute sh t obviusly are not intelligent enough to grasp all of the subtle humor that this movie has to offer it shows us that real life and ficticious action can produce a winning combination also as a romantic comedy it has one of the most clever ways for two people to find each other name me another movie where you can see all of that as well as donald sutherland singing a song like they're going to find your anus on a mountain on mars
gene kelly came up with some really grand ideas for musicals while with mgm here he's at the top of his creative powers working with the arthur freed musical unit hard to believe when you watch an american in paris that the players never left the back lot at mgm br br the magic of an american in paris is due to the creative editing under the direction of vincent minnelli and the sets that mgm designed blended with some background establishing shots the idea of the film originated with kelly who wanted simply to do a film with a lengthy ballet sequence involving george gershwin's tone poem an american in paris it sounded good to arthur freed who approached ira gershwin who said fine with him as long as they used other gershwin material br br gershwin got the kind of deal for gershwin music that irving berlin normally got not one note of non gershwin music is heard in an american in paris listen to some of the background music and you will hear things like embraceable you and but not for me which are not real musical numbers br br another guy who was a fair hand at writing lyrics alan jay lerner wrote the story which admittedly is a thin one all about an ex gi played by gene kelly who after world war ii never left france just settled into an apartment on the left bank and proceeded to become a starving artist he lives with eccentric composer oscar levant and does that ever sound like a redundancy br br two women are interested in him another expatriate american played by nina foch who wants to sponsor him as a painter if he'll reciprocate in other matters but kelly falls for a shop girl played by leslie caron in her film debut caron also has musical comedy star georges guetary interested in here br br of course the plot is just an excuse to sing and dance to the music of george gershwin an american in paris happens to be the first film i ever saw as an in flight movie on the first airplane trip i ever took i still remember flying back from phoenix arizona to kennedy airport seeing gene kelly doing i've got rhythm my favorite number in the film however is tra la la which kelly sings and dances all over the apartment with oscar levant playing the piano at one point kelly dances on top of the baby grand piano br br in a book about arthur freed i read a quote where he said in the american in paris ballet sequence was to be done with the background of the french impressionists which he felt the public would take to rather than a realistic setting on the streets or back lot so it happened that way kelly had done lengthy ballet sequences in words and music the pirate and on the town but this one topped them all still does in my opinion and that includes some of gene kelly's later films br br in a surprise upset at the oscars an american in paris was chosen best picture for 1951 beating out the heavily favored a streetcar named desire i guess fantasy trumped realism that year big budgets also have an upper hand in these things as well br br still an american in paris is one of the best movie musicals ever done and since the studios no longer have all that creative talent under one roof something less likely to be repeated
i've read the other reviews and found some to be comparison of movie v real life eg what it takes to get into music school britney bashing etc etc so let's focus on the movie and the message br br i have rated this movie 7 out of 10 for the age range 8 to 14 years and for a family movie for the average adult male 2 out of 10 br br i like pop rock music i'm 45 i know of britney spears but never realised she actually sang stronger until i read the credits and these reviews i didn't recognise her poster on the wall so i was not worried about any 'self promotion' br br i watch movies to be entertained i don't care about casting lighting producers directors etc what is the movie and does it entertain me br br i watched this movie for the message the world's greatest epidemic is low self esteem which is a whole other story so watched with the message in mind as that is an area of interest the movie is light bright and breezy great for kids i found the texan twang began to fade throughout the movie and of course there are only so many ways to convey the give up don't give up message so yeh it was a bit predictable great message though should be more of them br br this movie is a great family movie but for a bloke watching by himself get hannibal
i saw the 7 5 imdb rating on this movie and on the basis of that decided to watch this movie which my roommate had rented she said she had seen it before it's funny and sad i cried the first time i saw it she gushed maybe compared to other bollywood movies this deserves a 7 5 out of 10 but in comparison to all the other movies i have seen in my lifetime this deserves no more than a 3 any movie where i can perpetually guess what is going to happen next is no good for me the characters are unbelievable how the act is not realistic at all and their motives are contrived it is over dramatic and the songs aren't all that great my biggest problem with bollywood movies is the lack of subtlety all the emotions are way too overdone and thus not at all realistic any emotion or bond between characters that is the least bit subtle must be magnified with an unnecessary song i think i understood that the relationship between the father and son was more like one between friends than one between a parent and child without having to have it conveyed via a five minute long song the stupid comic relief complete with laugh track was not funny or necessary we get it laxman isn't the sharpest tool in the shed if a movie tries to elicit tears through the most hackneyed means possible it just isn't meaningful just a bit embarrassing br br spoiler br br generally if someone has terminal stage lung cancer their son who lives with them would know something was wrong without having to be told too many plot holes to count at first the movie was amusing and cute in the way bollywood movies are to people who don't watch them that avidly but it just got tedious it takes a lot of skill to make a movie that is amusing and heartwrenching and the best way to do it is usually not having all the amusing parts in the first half of the movie and all the heartwrenching parts at the end br br spoiler over perhaps it had a very little more depth than other bollywood movies that i have seen but not much at all i spent more time laughing at the stupidity of the movie than the parts that were supposed to be funny i didn't shed a single tear nor did i feel like it rather i was overwhelmed with a feeling of disgust at the attempt at a dramatic ending i don't recommend this movie if you want to watch something good i recommend it if you want to watch a bollywood movie that is kind of sad
i do not watch much television and came across this show reality show i sure hope this is not for real if i was a man and had such a nag and was married to someone so snotty it would be grounds for divorce i think she sets a bad example of how a person should treat a person they love that is one thing that is wrong with our world now so many people in bad relationships selfish and do not know the meaning of what it is to truly love another it is self sacrificing and not something that should be on merritt that does not give one a very good feeling to watch what should be in private counseling if his personality on the show is for real then he deserves someone much better that would show real true love and care for him and appreciate him for who he is is this show a reality or made up for ratings i really would like to know sincerely gb
i'm not going to criticize the movie there isn't that much to talk about it has good animal actions scenes which were probably pretty astonishing at the time clyde beatty isn't exactly a matinée idol he's a little slight and not particularly good looking but that's ok he's the man in that lion cage we know that when he can't take the time away from his lions to tend to his girlfriend he will end up on an island with her and have to save the day someone said earlier that it is a history lesson the scenes at the circus are of another day especially the kids who hang around i didn't realize that even back in the thirties they sailed on three masted schooners it looked like something out of 1860 i guess that's the stock footage they had no wonder the thing got wrecked they're always talking about fixing her up there's even a dirigible it tells us a little about male female relationships at the time a kind of giggly silliness but if you don't take it too seriously you can have fun watching it
i've tried to watch this so called comedy but it's very hard to bear this is a bad narrow minded cliché ridden movie definitively not funny but very much boring and annoying indeed bad script bad acting it's a complete waste of time and there remains nothing more to say i'm afraid br br 1 out of 10 points
born again is a okay episode of season 1 the reincarnation bit in my opinion is cool the more i watch it the more i like it yet it will never rise above 'very good' for me even though it is not very memorable i'll always remember it as the reincarnation episode anyway now i will say what is good and bad about this episode br br the good oragami oh yeah br br that fish tank was nice br br thrown out of a window very classy x br br the bad marry your best friend's wife o o br br what a random pick to reincarnate br br why didn't the guy who died by having his scarf tangled up try to take his scarf off instead br br conclusion okay episode not very memorable 7 10
one of the most interesting movies to be classified as blaxploitation bakshi's coonskin is a rich text full of wonderful insight he wrote it in collaboration with scat man crothers and barry white who appear in the film as well the racist imagery can often be disturbing but the message of the movie was so powerful that the naacp gave it an endorsement but only grudgingly br br i highly recommend this movie to anyone who is interested in an examination of the pervading atmosphere of racism that bakshi attempts to deconstruct wonderful stuff
this movie was pretty absurd there was a few funny parts its goes right in to the bin of movies in my memory where i think hmm that movie had a few funny parts but overall pretty ridiculous plot or lack of br br i thought it seemed like ben was trying a little too hard to be a cooky funny guy and i didn't understand how he was a self made multi millionaire and still such an idiot anyways i like ben affleck he makes some crap but hey i can forgive him i mean i liked jersey girl i didn't think gigli was all his fault i like him overall i guess he's kinda like the kid you feel sorry for cuz he just can't seem to get it right br br my advice would be to avoid this flick it didn't really develop in to a workable plot and catherine o'hara and jimmy g weren't used as well as they could have been they deserved better overall this movie is not home alone it's not a christmas story its not christmas vacation or any of the other classics forever forgettable
i very nearly walked out but i'd paid my money and my nearly as disgusted friend wanted to hold out after the endearing wide eyed innocence of a new hope and the thrilling sophistication of the empire strikes back i remember awaiting return of the jedi with almost aching anticipation but from the opening scene of this insultingly commercial sewage i was bitterly disappointed and enraged at lucas he should have been ashamed of himself but this abomination undeniably proves that he doesn't have subatomic particle of shame in his cold greedy heart episode i would go on to reinforce this fact your honor i call jarjar binks but please issue barf bags to the members of the jury first br br from the initial raising of the gate at jabba's lair this film was nothing more than a two plus hour commercial for as many licensable profit making action figures as lucas could cram into it the pig like guards the hokey flesh pigtailed flunky that vile muppet pet of jabba's the new and recycled cabaret figures the monsters etc etc ad vomitum then there were the detestably cute and marketable ewoks pile on top of that all of the rebel alliance aliens fifteen seconds each on screen or less and the kiddies just gotta have one for their collection the blatant exploitative financial baiting of children is nauseating br br lucas didn't even bother to come up with a new plot he just exhumed the death star from a new hope and heaved in a boatload of cheap sentiment what an appalling slap in the face to his fans i can't shake the notion that lucas took a perverse pleasure in inflicting this dreck on his fans i've got these lemmings hooked so bad that i can crank out the worst piece of stinking putrid garbage that i could dream up and they'll flock to the theaters to scarf it up plus all the kiddies will whine and torture their parents until they buy the brats a complete collection of action figures of every single incidental undeveloped cartoonish caricature that i stuffed in and i get a cut from every single one it'll make me even more obscenely rich br br there may have been a paltry partial handful of redeeming moments in this miserable rip off i seem to recall that harrison ford managed to just barely keep his nose above the surface of this cesspool but whatever tiny few bright spots there may be are massively obliterated by the offensive commercialism that lucas so avariciously embraced in this total absolute sell out to profit
growing up in nyc in the late 80's early 90's club scene i can personally say this is one of the most important documentaries made in covering that place in this time period no madonna did not come up with the idea of voguing but this is where she got it from instead of taking out violence on each other or in bitchy cat fights voguing allowed people to fight within the confines of everything short of touching each other which would warrant an automatic disqualification seeing these kind of extraordinarily talented well orchestrated throw downs in the clubs was nothing short of spectacular and all the big names from back in the day are here pepper la beija paris duprée xtragavaganza etc all commemorated in the likes of such period pieces as malcom mclaren's song deep in vogue it didn't matter who you were or where you were from because when you walked through those doors into this magic kingdom of sorts you became part of something bigger than yourself you were important and most importantly the creation of your own moves and imagination and anybody from anywhere could become king or queen as the case may have been the words and wit were just as sharp as the moves on the floor all of the tension excitement and magic of that very urban nyc energy is captured in this film brilliant please release on dvd for the world to see thank you
i rented this film about a month ago when i had nothing else to do on a friday night all i can say to describe this worthless film is 'trash' the acting is so badly done i've seen kids in high school do a better job the whole cast seems like they're just reading their lines out no feeling no emotion and no room to capture the viewer on another note the special effects were insanely cheesy and the whole thing looked like it had been shot with a camera anyone can buy a radio shack br br the clown himself looks nothing like the one on the video cover heck he doesn't even show up in the film until near the end and all he does it hum songs and go around stalking a few characters there is no real murder shown either so this isn't a real slasher film either since i've seen it i've questioned a few things 1 if is 'serial insane clown killer' wouldn't that be a serial killer who kills clowns 2 if your friend goes missing why would you go out into the woods to have sex rather than look for her sad really br br 3 why is it that the only real acting sputtered vainly out at the end all of a sudden did the cast finally decide to show effort in their jobs this film is as sad as they come my advice is to avoid renting it lest you waste an hour or two of your time laughing more than screaming
no one is a greater fan of geroge macdonald fraser's flashman papers than i am br br i was surprised to see just now that richard lester directed royal flash since i also see he had made the three four musketeers with fraser which i though turned out rather well br br not so royal flash br br i was 12 years old when the film was released and could not have been more enthusiastic since i had read all the flashman papers published up to that time and was intoxicated with a clockwork orange and malcolm macdowel i still am but he was never really given a chance after that br br what a disappointment i saw it once again when i was about 20 on television and it seemed even worse br br none of the sharp dialogue in the books is transfered to the screen the comedy of flashman's character seemed to me to have been mishandled in about the same way one could imagine a group of high school students trying to parody it would do the dueling and fencing was awful and undramatic br br looking back with more mature eyes the film failed completer to exploit the possibilities of direct satire of earlier film versions of the prisoner of zenda br br if you have read the book and not seen the film i can only say that the film ends with flashman and rudi von starnberg becoming fast friends and playing a game rudi has just invented russian roulette br br a pathetic betrayal of everything the books are about br br my comments would be more direct if i had seen the film more recently but i am glad i have not br br if by any chance fraser ever reads this i can only say i think he is a genius perhaps the greatest comic novelist of his generation but based on my appreciation of that corpus of work it as hard to believe that he wrote the screenplay of this film as that he did all those awful roger moore james bond films
lizzie borden's love crimes is an important film dealing with the dark side of female sexuality and including full frontal female nudity which sure beats the male kind it flirts with sadomasochism and the captive falling in love with captor theory br br this treatment of feminine libido is sometimes shallow and jerky but borden has travelled well beyond feminist dogma of females gaining power through their insatiable lust br br one striking scene exposes the female fetish for horses when the antagonist a counterfeit fashion photographer is seducing an older woman wearing breeches by asking her to show how she rides a horse he shoves a riding crop between her legs pressing it against her crotch and this greatly increases her excitement br br then suddenly he leaves her home and she swears abjectly at the closed door br br patrick bergin plays the con artist and though he falls a long distance from handsome he picks on plain janes and has enough screen presence to make one believe the women could swallow his line by all reports sean young proves a weird person and she is scarcely beautiful yet in this film as the district attorney her intense face and long limbed slender body and accentuated hips and periodically disjointed movement alchemize into erotic fascination her performance is forceful and complex br br borden possesses an intriguing worldview and the fact that it stands so at odds with the modern feckless zeitgeist i truly appreciate
the poster who called this plotless and pointless literally took the words i would have used in my subject line the only thing i'd add is passionless for a film made by a real life married couple and featuring lots of graphic sex scenes this movie manages to make what should be a sultry situation into one beyond ice cold dafoe and colagrande look bored during the sex scenes and the viewer might as well take a valium and have done with it also please the women in the audience have seen way too many used tampons in their time and any guy who is turned on by seeing willem dafoe pull a bloody tampon out of his wife's vagina really needs to get therapy br br i think the key to the film if there is one is the restaurant scene where a waiter explains to the perpetually sleepy eyed dafoe what a deconstructed jambalaya is all the ingredients of the dish still separate rather than simmered together this movie is a deconstructed thriller all the elements are there spooky isolated house dead spouse creepy violins on the score weirdo caretaker who comes and goes as he pleases auto accident deaths and near deaths characters with a secret past basically every thriller cliché you can think of but nothing comes together everything just sits there and never meshes into a coherent plot or even an artsy mood piece at the restaurant dafoe passes on the deconstructed jambalaya prospective renters of this mess would do well to leave this deconstructed thriller on the video store shelf
in my opinion this has to be one of barbara stanwyck's best performances she was one of only a handful of actors then and now who could say more with a single look than an entire page of dialogue and i was lucky enough to see the original and uncensored movie with the extra 4 minutes of additional footage too bad the movie is so short lily is a young woman barely holding it together working for her father in his illegal speakeasy her only link to anything is her good friend chico played wonderfully by theresa harris though chico is african american and having a white woman be best friends with a black woman back in the 30s was as controversial as the subject matter of this movie and lily is not they have a special bond and it is not sexual just 2 women stuck or shoved into a situation beyond their control after lily's father dies and she does not know what she will do she is told that she has the power to get out and to get what she wants yes it's immoral but that's the entire point of this movie then they had to go and ruin the last few minutes so up until the last few minutes of the movie it's a superb film and worth watching the lesson of the movie is still as valid today as it was back then and i'm sure will be a 100 years from now women it's awful what lily does in order to get what she wants but it works men take note

in 1976 i had just moved to the us from ceylon i was 23 and had been married for a little over three years and was beginning to come out as a lesbian i saw this movie on an old black and white tv with terrible reception alone and uninterrupted in an awakening that seemed like an echo of the story i was living in a small house in tucson arizona and it was summertime like everyone else here i never forgot the feelings the images of this story called forth and its residue of fragile magic and i have treasured a hope that i would see it again someday i'll keep checking in i also wish that someone would make a movie of shirley verel's 'the other side of venus' it also has some of the same delicacy and persistent poignancy

this has to be one of the worst movies of all time the graphics were horrendous the acting was b movie and the effects were just plain nintendo 64 qualified you would think that they would put a little more effort into it of course it is a scifi channel movie so you have to expect it to be low rate but this one takes the cake hell i'm still laughing so as a shake your head in disbelief movie this one does well br br although it appears to have some 'known' actors and actresses in this it is difficult for me to believe that they did not realize that the quality of this movie was worth their time and effort br br the graphics might have been good in the '60's or even early '70's but come on this is 2009 i wont give spoilers out let's just say that if you have played jurassic park on the nintendo 64 you will be very familiar with what you see in this film br br it is definitely not worth the 2 hours it took to sit through the thing
the groove tube was initially shown on video in the first video theaters here in boston in one room there were tv monitors on high stands with old movie theater seats in small groups facing the monitors there were old refrigerators stocked with pepsi and baskets of york peppermint patties in a second smaller room there were no seats just large pillows that was the 'smoking' room i e people got high in there that act only added to the hilarity of the video br br i was a 'frequent viewer' the scenes i liked most and remember to this day are koko the clown the kramp family kitchen kramp easy lube shortening safety sam vd psa the chevy chase hitchhiker w nude runs through the woods the finger ballet on what was eventually revealed to be the nude body of a woman the last item was very reminiscent of the late incredible ernie kovacs now i've lost a lot of readers that are under 48 who is ernie kovacs but trust me it's funny stuff br br one reason i was a 'frequent viewer' was that i and my friends would bring other groove tube virgins to see it we would sit and slyly watch the faces of the 'virgins' as the safety sam psa would play as the camera slowly zooms in on sam we would wait for that oh of recognition on the 'virgin's' face each time was more hilarious than the last and then that 'virgin' would then bring a friend to see the show repeating what we had done to get this joke you must watch the video br br yes some of it is dated but most plays film television and now videos are just look at any video made in the 1980's br br i did see the groove tube in a theater as a film a grainy transfer from the original video it had been cut and was missing some of the original high point scenes br br the first saturday night live show featuring chevy chase elicited instant remarks of that's the guy from the groove tube so it was a precursor for chevy br br i can't look at a can of shortening without hearing the voice over coat your hands with a generous amount of kramp easy lube shortening and thinking of the kramp holiday loaf recipe always gets me laughing in the baking needs aisle in the grocery store br br the early 70's were parlous times the groove tube was fresh new and really 'got' the humor of the times it offered a 'hip generation' humor that wasn't available in any other format medium mjh
some of the background details of this story are based very very loosely on real events of the era in which this was placed the story combines some of the details of the famous leopold and loeb case along with a bit of aimee semple mcpherson br br the story begins with two mothers shelley winters and debbie reynolds being hounded as they leave a courtroom the crowd seems most intent on doing them bodily harm as their sons were just convicted of a heinous thrill crime one person in the crowd apparently slashes winters' hand as they make their way to a waiting car br br soon after they arrive home they begin getting threatening phone calls so reynolds suggests they both move to the west coast together and open a dance school the dance school is s success and they cater to incredibly obnoxious parents who think their child is the next shirley temple one of the parents of these spoiled kids is a multimillionaire who is quite smitten with reynolds and they begin dating life appears very good but when the threatening phone calls begin again winters responds by flipping out behaving like she's nearing a psychotic break and she retreats further and further into religion listening on the radio to 'sister alma' almost constantly again and again you see winters on edge and it ultimately culminates in very bad things i won't say more as it might spoil this suspenseful and interesting film br br in many ways this film is a lot like the bette davis and joan crawford horror films of the 1960s like whatever happened to baby jane straight jacket and the nanny while none of these are exactly intellectual fare on a kitsch level they are immensely entertaining and fun the writing is very good and there are some nice twists near the end that make it all very exciting winters is great as a fragile and demented lady and reynolds plays one of the sexiest 39 year olds i've ever seen plus she can really really dance br br my only concern about all this is that some might find winters' hyper religiosity in the film a bit tacky like a cheap attack on christianity at first i felt that way but when you meet sister alma she seems sincere and is not mocked so i took winters' religious zeal as just a sign of craziness which i assume is all that was intended br br by the way this film is packaged along with whoever slew auntie roo another shelley winters horror film from 1971 both are great fun and quite over the top
it takes a serbian or at least a balkan familiarity to understand and enjoy many of the situations characters and jokes of 'zavet' as well as of many other films of kusturica see for example the opening scenes with the remote village in the serbian mountains with the low tech devices that defend the integrity and way of life of the inhabitants the nostalgia for the good days of the communist rule and the awakening of the young brat watching his nude teacher at the sounds of the soviet hymn kusturica not only tries to depart from the tragic history of serbia described in his previous movies but creates a whole world of himself in the process br br this is not a political film or not an explicit political film in any case it's a fun film before all kusturica creates a set of characters that we care about music plays an active role in this film same as in all his other movies his style is direct and grotesque we now what he feels about his characters and we know that he wants us to feel the same the space he develops melds present history and magic and the colours seem to be of a douanier rousseau of modern cinema br br this is not a perfect film either the principal flaw is the length some editing and shortening would have been useful as at some point in time the director seems to have run out of ideas and repetitions show up it is yet one of the most catching amusing moving films that i have seen lately
if there is one thing to recommend about this film is that it is intriguing the premise certainly draws the audience in because it is a mystery and throughout the film there are hints that there is something dark lurking about however there is not much tension and williams' mild mannered portrayal doesn't do much to makes us relate to his obsession with the boy br br collete fares much better as the woman whose true nature and intentions are not very clear the production felt rushed and holes are apparent it certainly feels like a preview for a much more complete and better effort the book is probably better br br one thing is certain taupin must have written something truly good to have inspired at least one commendable effort
during the early 1980's kurt thomas was something of a hero in the united states inevitably men in his position get offered film roles that exist solely to capitalize on that i have no idea what thomas was paid to make this film but i would have to be paid a big heap of money to agree to make a national fool of myself in a motion picture the film is obviously derived from enter the dragon as are most martial arts pictures only instead of a real martial art they concoct an absurd new martial art accurately described by one critic as a cross between kung fu and break dancing a gymnast thomas of course is hired to rescue some lady from an impenetrable fortress yet every room has a prop that is exactly what thomas needs to kick the assistant baddies of course he fights his way to the lead villain and of course they have a fancy dancy fight with an ending that will surprise only those who have never seen a marshal arts film there are touches which nostalgic types will like particularly the mullet haircuts of thomas and many of the male co stars have but the only reason to watch this film is if you have a grudge against kurt thomas who now wishes he had never set foot on the film set
as i've noticed with a lot of imdb comments certain reviewers seem to demand that every film they see have smugly intelligent plots that wallow in there own cleverness i am not one of those people if i watch an action film i want to see explosions gunfire and heroics if i watch a comedy i want to have tears of laughter in my eyes you get the idea therefore watching a horror film i primarily want to be scared the grudge is a very scary film in both it's well executed 'jump' scenes and it's creepy imagery i've been a horror film fan for many years and i'm talking about the masters such as dario argento rather than directors of some of the treadmill teen horror flicks that are churned out these days if you want to be scared watch this film way scarier than the original japanese 'ring' which i also think is a great film
a super comedy series from the 1990s two series were made in total that suffered in the uk ratings due to poor scheduling when you are up against established comedies like 'minder' even the best new comedies are going to struggle to get noticed br br luckily i caught the series from episode one and followed it avidly i mentioned it to friends and family at the time but everyone seemed to have been watching something else very very frustrating br br anyway i loved both series and never forgot it br br then i looked it up on the internet and found that an ultra fan was trying to get both series released 'on his own' br br well both series are now available on dvd br br http www replaydvd co uk joking apart s1 htm
this is probably the first entry in the lance o'leary nurse keat detective series in subsequent o'leary films he was played by much younger actors than guy kibbee br br a group of relatives all played by well known character actors gathers in an old house on a rainy nite of course to speak to a wealthy relative who goes into a coma br br while they wait for him to recover all sorts of mysterious goings on happen including a couple of murders br br a creepy film worth seeing
i actually felt bad for the actors in this thing no doubt a high school drama class could do a better job or at the very least as well a job the actors must have thought this would be their big chance working in a film it certainly was not besides the terrible acting the stories were boring and for the most part predictable the one about the remote control didn't even make any sense to bad cause it had the best premise in the bunch br br i'm all for supporting low budget films and giving new film makers a fair chance but this turkey is a waste of time and an insult to the viewer i only watched it because of some good comments posted here they must have been planted by people with ties to the film you may fool people into watching this but you can't fool them into liking what they saw br br i gave it a 2 instead of a 1 because at least the boxer story tried to be heart warming sure it failed miserably but it tried i reserve 1 s for the worst of the worst br br do yourself a favor and skip this dribble i wish i had

ying a chinese girl who speaks czech invited us to screening of a czech movie with english subtitles in the department of visual and environmental studies ves it was the first time i saw samotá 345 i loners 2000 and it was pretty good br br much like in many other czech movies the seven central characters seem to have a pretty difficult dirty life the web indicates that this theme was popular among the u s movies in the early 1990s their relationships are breaking up combining and recombining another typical feature of the czech movies is that neither of the characters is designed to be a universally negative one and neither of them is a permanently positive character either also you can see how the characters judge the features of others depending on the context that's a very realistic feature of the movie's psychological analysis br br ond 345 ej is a talented and married young surgeon who has two daughters nevertheless you learn that he has only studied neurobiology to prove how much he loved another woman hanka he is so obsessed that he repeatedly dresses up as a plumber to get into hanka's parents' house a house that he repeatedly burns br br meanwhile hanka has a very mixed relationship with her parents she just decides by tossing up a coin to break up with petr who works in a private radio station hanka does not view her parents' bourgeois life as a good example but seems rather unsuccessful in creating a better environment but she is a very flexible figure as far as the type of her boyfriends go br br for a while hanka seems to have serious plans with jakub an innocent drug addict whose memory seems to be rather devastated by the drugs however the friends from his band inform jakub that he already has another girlfriend hanka is disappointed and returns to her parents br br when hanka and petr break up it is organized by robert a matchmaker who also works for a travel agency where his job is to show the life of ordinary czech people to japanese tourists robert who also provides jakub with marijuana is never serious about anything and he usually sleeps with many different women eventually his mother dies in a hospital and he has his own ways to deal with the depression br br vesna a slavic word for spring who came to prague from macedonia works as a barmaid and you won't learn whether she came to czechia in order to see her dad or ufos she seems pretty confused but sometimes helps the other characters from their problems br br petr works in the radio station and he is the only one who likes his job a job that he eventually loses he announces to his audience that he broke up with hanka which is how ond 345 ej learns about the news that make him very happy br br finally ond 345 ej's wife lenka is always ready to forgive him and stabilize their marriage even after ond 345 ej asks a magician to make him disappear so that ond 345 ej can try to capture hanka again the magician pays his debt because he is a brother of a victim of an important car accident jakub and hanka bring the victim to the hospital and ond 345 ej saves his life lenka also works for the travel agency as a translator and eventually she has to translate some hysterical scenes for 20 or so japanese tourists who are shooting their movies during hanka parents' dinner br br the seven characters interact in interesting and exciting ways that would be natural if prague were smaller by four orders of magnitude given the actual size of the czech capital it looks a bit unlikely that all these events would take place among seven people but it is fun
i love bed knobs and broomsticks so much that it makes me cry a thousand tears of joy every time i have the magnificent pleasure of seeing it i would also like to reiterate the simple fact that i love it so much too much some have said i have 27 copies on video and i love them all equally i also love anyone else who loves it i love you my favourite scene is the dance scene at portobello road i have learned the dance moves and practice it everyday i have some audio recordings of myself singing the song if anyone can play the drums or guitar i am thinking of forming a bed knobs and broomsticks band i hope to call it 'the knobs' love me liz
i usually try to be professional and constructive when i criticize movies but my god this was the worst movie i have ever seen bad acting bad effects bad script bad everything br br the plot follows a group of teen cliche's on their way to a rave that takes place in broad daylight at a remote island however when the group arrives all they find is an empty dance floor and bloody clothes determined to find out what happened to the rest of the party goers the clan set's off on a mission through a zombie infested forest during this crusade they are aided by a police chick and a sea captain that just happens to have the right number of weapons to give to each of the kids they also meet up with jonathan cherry and some other survivors basically the rest of the movie is a collection of poorly directed action sequences including a far too long shootout outside of the house of the dead this fight came complete with cheesy hollywood violence redundant clips from the hotd video game and sloppy matrix esque camera rotations one of the character's even volunteers to sacrifice himself to save the others why not because he was noble and brave but because part of his face got scarred by acid a zombie spat on him after he continued to beat the creature long after it had been disabled i'm supposed to feel sorry for this guy br br to sum it all up there is absolutely no point in seeing this movie unless you want to see for yourself just how terrible it is the theater i was in was more dead than the zombies on the screen and i'm sure the money i wasted seeing this piece of sh t could easily cover the costs it took to make it grade f
stephen king is generally known for the morbid and that's fine but this story is too morbid some movies by the end you feel sad for the characters or the situations they were put through here you just feel depressed the movie has a nice feel to it at first with the family moving to the country and creepy old fred gwyne greeting and warning them of the pet cemetery but this plot leads nowhere it starts with so much potential but by the end it loses the potential to be a good horror movie and becomes corny extremely stupid and ultimately depressing br br louis dale midkoff his wife rachel denise crosby their kids ellie and gage and their cat move to a new home in maine they are warned by the loony farmer neighbor jud fred gwyne about the local pet cemetery and how it is cursed louis thinks nothing of this and everything's fine until the family cat is killed he bury's it in the cursed cemetery and it comes back to life constantly hissing at the family and wanting to be left alone one day infant gage runs out in the road and is run over and killed by a truck and louis knows he must bury him in the cemetery when gage comes back to life he is changed and wants to murder br br with many of stephen king's works that don't translate well into films i blame the directors and screenwriters in this case mr king was the screenwriter but i'm going to blame him for his awful story by the end it's so pointless and though unfunny the premise is laughable a little boy comes back from the dead and manages to kill people with what looks like a tiny scalpel and not only that but he manages to lift their bodies and in one case carry a body from the ground to the attic i know this isn't set in reality but seriously how stupid can this get the scene where louis injects his deceased now living again cat to kill it is strangely sad because the cat did not deserve this all it did was go around minding it's own business and he killed it the scene where he injects his own infant son is almost unbearable not unbearably sad but the whole situation is just awful to think of after being injected gage staggers drunkenly around before falling down dead why did they need to make a movie ending with the death of an infant but even worse the actual ending of them film involving louis burying someone else not going to give away who in the cemetery after gage kills them what did he expect why did mr king write this horrible story and why was it made into a movie it's depressing and pointless br br my rating out of 90 mins r for violence
in the history of movies based on comic books mystery men is one of the most underrated ones this is no regular comic superhero movie it follows the exploits of a motley crew of well meaning wannabes which include mr furious played by ben stiller the bowler janeane garofalo the shoveller william h macy the blue rajah hank azariah and the spleen paul reubens mystery men spoofs several aspects of superhero movies like superman or batman such as the pithy sayings and the questions about secret identities most of the superheroes aren't billionaires like bruce wayne but blue collar types with menial jobs and neurotic home lives so it looks as if director kinka usher is making the heroes into something the average viewer can relate to i found mystery men to be visually stimulating and very funny even if it doesn't turn into a franchise it's still a joy to watch
i rented i am curious yellow from my video store because of all the controversy that surrounded it when it was first released in 1967 i also heard that at first it was seized by u s customs if it ever tried to enter this country therefore being a fan of films considered controversial i really had to see this for myself br br the plot is centered around a young swedish drama student named lena who wants to learn everything she can about life in particular she wants to focus her attentions to making some sort of documentary on what the average swede thought about certain political issues such as the vietnam war and race issues in the united states in between asking politicians and ordinary denizens of stockholm about their opinions on politics she has sex with her drama teacher classmates and married men br br what kills me about i am curious yellow is that 40 years ago this was considered pornographic really the sex and nudity scenes are few and far between even then it's not shot like some cheaply made porno while my countrymen mind find it shocking in reality sex and nudity are a major staple in swedish cinema even ingmar bergman arguably their answer to good old boy john ford had sex scenes in his films br br i do commend the filmmakers for the fact that any sex shown in the film is shown for artistic purposes rather than just to shock people and make money to be shown in pornographic theaters in america i am curious yellow is a good film for anyone wanting to study the meat and potatoes no pun intended of swedish cinema but really this film doesn't have much of a plot
this episode is certainly different than all the other columbos though some of the details are still there the setup is completely different that makes this columbo unique and interesting to watch even though at times you might wish for the old columbo i liked it a lot but then i like almost any columbo
another cult strikes again this isn't a spoiler because the real ending comes after you research the folks who brought this overly long pseudo scientific infomercial ramtha's school of enlightenment br br when any religion philosophy needs to hide behind an oz like screen of deceit i walk away thank ramtha i watched a borrowed copy of this movie on the recommendation of a friend to have wasted precious resources on this new age lobotomizer would have been tragic i can only hope that they truly believe they can walk on water enough to take that guidance to it's logical conclusion in other words walk drown or shut up as a movie it deserves a strong 1 on it's entertainment value especially for creating the most dislikable character in film history the photographer's roommate eeeeeek if you must see this film borrow it from one of the brainwashed folks who recommended it
never even knew this movie existed until i found an old vhs copy of it hidden deep in my dusty horror closet the title on the box said insect and the illustrations on the back made clear that it is just another insignificant and poorly produced 80's horror movie they can surely be fun of course as long as don't expect an intelligent scenario and as long as you're not irritated by seeing a giant amount of cheesy make up effects just about every important aspect that makes a horror movie worthy viewing is substandard here in blue monkey the plot is ridiculous and highly unoriginal the acting performances are painful to observe and there's a total lack of suspense following the always popular trend of big bug movies blue monkey handles about a new and unknown insect species that wipes out the doctors and patients of a remote hospital the makers couldn't be more evasive about the actual origin of this gigantically over sized critter all we know is that it's not from outer space and it initially crawled out of a tropical plant other than this there's absolutely no explanation for where this new type of insect all of a sudden comes from like i said don't get your hopes up for an intelligent screenplay the first half of the film is entertaining enough with some nice gore and the introduction of a couple deranged characters an 80 year old blind and alcoholic lady but the second half when the entire hospital is put to quarantine is dreadfully boring it is also near the end that blue monkey begins to exaggeratedly rip off older and better films approaching the climax they apparently ran out of budget as well since the lighting becomes very poor and the guy in the monster suit isn't very well camouflaged anymore blue monkey is worth a peek in case you're really bored or if you really want to see every 80's horror movie ever made fans of b cinema may recognize john vernon killer klowns from outer space curtains in the small and meaningless role of roger who's in charge of the clinic
does anyone happen to know where this film was shot the aviation scene on the cliff is beautiful it appears to be england however ivy's apartment building certainly looks like the brill building with its fascinating elevators br br charles mendl is listed as playing sir charles gage maybe i blinked but i never saw him perhaps he was the husband's lawyer but again i don't recall that character being in the film other than being mentioned as having made a phone call perhaps he was in the aviation scene or the ballroom scene did anyone spot him br br herbert marshall was 57 years old when he shot this film
fearful symmetry is a pleasant episode with a few faults the first thing about the episode is that it takes place near mountain home air force base in southwest idaho season one's 'deep throat' takes place near ellens air base also in southwest idaho i'm wondering if the air force bases are one and the same but they decided to use the real name in fearful symmetry mulder and scully have some good dialog always a plus ed meecham the zoo keeper reminds me of cranky old school teachers they must have liked children at one time you just can't imagine how just like he must have cared more for animals at one point i liked the concept of the episode but i felt it had some inconsistencies if aliens are so adept at abducting humans and returning them safely why can't they put the animal back in the right place and the aliens are just now having problems returning the animals i don't buy mulder's theory of a problem with the space time continuum as if he's an expert on that i also thought jayne atkinson's performance as willa ambrose was not well done besides those nitpicks i still enjoyed this episode because of the intriguing concept of aliens harvesting animal dna as well as human dna
what in god's name happened here how does one go about creating what is practically a cheap knockoff of redneck zombies was zombie '90 ever supposed to entertain someone anyone or even make a dollars profit but mainly what happened here br br zombie '90 extreme pestilence was directed by a lunatic by the name of andreas schnaas who specializes in earth shattering gore films such as goblet of gore and anthropophagus 2000 and some of which contain profanity in the titles in the gore department this one isn't much different than the rest although the level of ineptness well earth shattering br br zombie '90 extreme pestilence is as bad as peter jackson's dead alive is gory think about it br br getting too specific with the story would be a waste of time an accident involving chemicals causes the dead to come back and eat the living never has the concept been treated in such a manner the gore effects are a whole new low just a z grade nightmare i can't tell whether or not this was originally meant to be funny somehow i doubt the english dubbing was being very true to the original script but stranger things have happened the whole thing just reminds me of a shot on video introduction to a troma movie except it lasts a hell of a lot longer br br i've seen only one film that was worse than this the chooper br br for proof that andreas schnaas is an actual director i would highly recommend nikos the impaler if you think you have no standards in what you look for in a bad movie give extreme pestilence a try but you've been warned it takes nerves of steel to make it all the way through but if gore is all you're here for then you might be able to stomach this one other than that no atmosphere no and i mean no budget no entertainment value but mostly no pride show some pride schnaas 1 10 br br updated 7 5 09 after a few more viewings of zombie '90 i've had a change of heart or i guess i just get it now zombie '90 is hilarious so nevermind the harsh words although extreme pestilence still only deserves one star
this is a hard boiled warner brothers film starring a very young barbara stanwyck a consummate master at portraying machiavellian cool a technique she perfected eleven years later in billy wilder's double indemnity stanwyck plays lily powers the well worn daughter of a violent speakeasy owner in a suffocating steel town she has been rendered cynical and numb by years of being offered up as a sexual favor to her father's customers once her father dies in a distillery explosion she hops a freight train to new york and literally sleeps her way up the corporate ladder of a bank br br this would come across as preposterous were it not for stanwyck's blazing work here with her dead eyed stare and amoral seduction methods it is easy to see why men become addicted to her aggressive carnality one of the young men she seduces along the way is a fresh faced john wayne as of all things an accountant named jimmy mccoy the melodrama gets heavy handed toward the last third of the film with a murder suicide a hush hush job in paris to keep lily quiet and the new bank president who is so addicted to lily that he embezzles company funds to keep her in luxury a tacked on ending is somewhat disappointing but not before stanwyck sears the screen the film has curious touches like lily's bonding friendship with an african american woman named chico and the german immigrant who teaches lily about nietzsche philosophy regarding the importance of avoiding sentimentality
judy holliday struck gold in 1950 withe george cukor's film version of born yesterday and from that point forward her career consisted of trying to find material good enough to allow her to strike gold again br br it never happened in it should happen to you i can't think of a blander title by the way holliday does yet one more variation on the dumb blonde who's maybe not so dumb after all but everything about this movie feels warmed over and half hearted even jack lemmon in what i believe was his first film role can't muster up enough energy to enliven this recycled comedy the audience knows how the movie will end virtually from the beginning so mostly it just sits around waiting for the film to catch up br br maybe if you're enamored of holliday you'll enjoy this otherwise i wouldn't bother br br grade c
my left foot is a pretty impressive film that tells the story of christy brown an artist who was crippled with cerebral palsy and learned to paint with his left foot the only limb in his body he had control over daniel day lewis won his first oscar as best actor for this film which i'm not absolutely certain was deserved but is still noteworthy day lewis give brown a realistic and occasionally almost humorous touch brenda fricker as brown's devoted mother also won an oscar for a believable and touching role my problem with this film is that it is a bit too real at times when brown is in desperation and must help someone and do it all with his left foot the film can be difficult to watch this gives it an often depressing feel that may turn off some viewers for a time however if you look beyond that you will see a sense of hope and inspiration for those who have handicaps and other difficulties to overcome those of us who are not crippled and still consider ourselves to have problems are inspired by this film because if somewhat with a much worse condition than us can overcome their difficulties we can certainly do the same thing well made occasionally enjoyable but difficult to watch may not be for everyone but not bad at all br br out of
my god was this the run lola run adaptation of persuasion it was horrible bad enough that the screenwriter and i use the term very loosely cut and pasted dialogue from one character onto another often completely out of context and to rush the story along but anne elliott running from location to location in pursuit of wentworth near the end of the piece was an abomination austen must be spinning in her grave no respectable young woman would have acted in such an atrocious fashion and the actress that played mary horrors needless to say if the rest of the austen remakes are this bad they will be turning off a new generation of watchers br br if you want to see an impeccable version of this otherwise wonderful novel get the 1995 roger michell directed version starring amanda root whose expressions alone can speak volumes and ciaran hinds it is superb

for some reason various young couples hiking through the italian alps split up to see who can reach their campsite designation first james gregory lee kenyon enters a cave finds a skeleton of an ancient demonic gladiator and becomes possessed by the spirit of tyranus when he puts on a helmet belonging to the corpse he then spends the rest of the film running around in the woods hunting down his friends and hacking off their limbs to add to some stew to bring the undead demonicus back to life this shot on digital full moon release is stupid senseless has terrible acting and sound and the los angeles national forest is a poor substitute for italy however it's pretty high on the unintentional laugh scale thanks mainly to the overwrought lead performance whether bug eyed running around in cheap looking armor brandishing a sword or spouting neurotic latin gibberish about demons and resurrection kenyon's ridiculous facial expressions and awkward line delivery must be seen to be believed oh well at least he's not boring like most of the rest of the cast
what keeps us going or at least what i feel the writer wanted us to keep us glued at an early point is our desire to know whether martinaud has done the dirty deed without spoiling so much of course there is a red herring and a twist but then we discover that this is the story of martinaud's imperfections and his difficulty in coping when there is the revelation we begin to sympathize and pity him because as the story progresses we are made to think he is the sick perverted pedophiliac that we're predisposed to have in mind one of those things he has to cope with is the distant gap he and his wife have even though they live on the same roof these problems of course are given their denouement in the film's shocking finale br br this movie demands your patience and it has certainly tried those of restless teenagers sitting at the rear they were heckling obviously because they aren't partial to central location films although there is a bit of travelling when we get to the woods and the beach and we realize that gallien isn't as clever as we are made to think he is br br the inquisitor is 5 5
everyone in the cast from sugiyama to aoki and toyoko is someone we know in everyday life they were so natural and sugiyama's transformation is incredibly believable the score is so moving it brought me to tears the choreography was beautiful without seeming athletic mai's graceful dancing and charm gave me goosebumps tamako is such a wonderfully delightful character you can almost see the charmed schoolgirl in her face as she reminisces about seeing the king and i aoki's character is both hilarious and pitiful masako is so overwhelmingly natural as the bewildered wife you almost want to hug her to reassure her that everything will be all right br br this film is truly a keeper
this movie is ridiculous anyone saying the acting is great and the casting is superb have never seen even mediocre cinema the acting is obviously terrible in the first 5 characters you meet lame i feel like all the other soaring comments must have been made by people associated with the filmmakers i was not very impressed by the storyline but just wanted to see some beautiful oregon countryside and there was some decent cinematography but the casting was anything but inspired i think this movie also makes a mockery of the generally noble suggestion that something deep in the amerindian culture has been ignored and perhaps lost and that reviving it is worthwhile and possible it places jokes in the wrong and all too obvious places and makes me think it was written by the state department or something back to the drawing board to even suggest that this film deserves a place in the same vicinity of classics like harold and maude is absolutely retarded and along the same line of begging and pretension and joking as is rampant in this film
as you may or may not have heard there is no actual fighting between vampires or zombies in this film one may then ask why the title suggested such a thing but really it's kind of appropriate because nothing else about this film made any sense either there was absolutely no story or plot just things happening the acting was incredibly bad worse than safeauto commercials bad br br not only were there no fighting between vampires and zombies but i think there was only one scene with zombies even in it their make up looked as if it were applied by an 8 year old girl the scene was totally random and out of place and featured one of the characters fighting the zombies off with a hedge trimmer i'm not kidding but they used chainsaw sound effects br br this was undoubtedly the poorest movie i've ever seen in my life the only circumstance that i wouldn't totally ridicule every person responsible for production of this film is if i learned that it was produced entirely by 11 year old's br br really though even with all of the criticism i offer here i'd suggest watching this movie solely based on the fact that it may very well be the worst movie ever and because of this is quite comical even just counting the flaws in it should keep you entertained
and rent a good horror movie it's like the writer had never seen a horror movie before and didn't realize every single thing he wrote was clichéd and hackneyed and has been parodied to perfection in movies like scream and scary movie br br in between the scary bits is the most banal and boring dialog ever written stupid we're going to the prom junk i wanted to claw my ears off honestly the hills has better dialog br br there really was no need to make this movie leading lady is uninteresting and i kept thinking her really guy is obsessed with her really br br all the characters act in stupid ways including the police cover the place in teams of 2 front and back not one sleepy cop sitting in his car with the window rolled down just waiting for his throat to be slashed br br the serial killer just swans about murdering everyone he wants without the least bit of problem no resistance from victims or doors nobody has any protection or the least idea of fighting back or flipping the security lock on the hotel room door the people are like mentally disabled sheep br br by the by if you're a gore fan you'll be disappointed too all the killing is kept offscreen and is ahem tastefully done so boo hoo for you br br none of the killings is the least bit interesting most of the time they've already happened by the time we find out br br the only cliché missing was the cat that always pops out in this kind of movies oh kitty you scared me i thought you were the killer aiieeee br br and then at the end when it's time for the killer to die well let's just say it's the easiest and most obvious choice snore br br the audience was jeering and talking back to the screen throughout it was too dumb to believe and not really scary enough don't encourage this kind of lazy film making br br oh and by the way no crowning of a prom king or queen no tiara no bucket of blood br br so save your money and rent carrie or friday the 13th or halloween or scream or scary movie any of them to get a good scare with some original twists

when people nowadays hear of a 1940s drama they usually appear to create a distance of irony claiming that it's another tearjerker with great stars in the lead of tragic melancholic roles this opinion however does not resemble neorealist movies in particular this one directed by count luchino visconti ossessione as his debut once censored and once cherished as nearly a realistic masterpiece is still loved by some people and strongly criticized by others the contradictory opinions about the film that have appeared in these 65 years seem to have been caused by the content of the movie itself exceptionally controversial for modern times as well as the past at the same time while being based on the novel by james m cain the postman always rings twice it is one of the most genuine screen adaptations where director remains his own style view his own art i have seen the film twice and the second viewing led me to very detailed analysis part of which i'd like to entail below br br first visconti's movie seems to touch all psychology and actions that people may do in life in particular those absorbed by desire these people make such tragic decisions in spite of terrible consequences they are bound to face gino massimo girotti a traveler with bear like shoulders turns up at the crossroad of a motorway near ferrara and enters the tavern although many people go there to have a meal gino occurs to get something more much more the indefatigable desire of beautiful giovanna clara calamai a woman already married to an elderly man who runs the bar mr giuseppe bragana juan de landa her body and her song possess his mind totally and from the moment of their first love the couple plan to get rid of the old obstacle and build up a new life together however are people bound to wrong deeds in face of desire can one build love upon murder what is love and what is loyalty does desire lead to a dangerous addiction or even obsession such questions intensely arise while watching the movie when to the core the viewer is supplied with an insight into characters we have to love each other affectionately answers giovanna seemingly giving a cure to all crying conscience but may desirous love justify and cure everything isn't it what we both wanted says one of the couple it occurs that it's not therefore the content of the film appears to be very dangerous if not analyzed with intellect and heart yet it constantly remains thought provoking br br second ossessione has a very strong point that talks to modern viewers brilliant moments and marvelous cinematography which go in pair with memorable sequences and visual power these make a modern viewer realize that a film made almost 70 years ago is absolutely entertaining to watch they range from tasteful erotic images to purely technical shots who can possibly skip that moment in ferrara where gino meets a beautiful girl a sort of ragazza perfetta perfect girl a dancer anita and buys her ice cream his desires show him totally different direction do viewers remain indifferent at gino giovanna's first meeting the first focus of camera is on giovanna's legs seemingly representing carnal desire over love that gino experiences a marvel of shot is gino and giovanna leaving the investigation room and the closeup of their shadows that directs our attention towards their suspicious look br br third ossessione can boast outstanding performances both from the leading pair as well as the supporting cast massimo girotti once said in an interview that working in this movie had been one of the most difficult jobs he had ever done yet consequently what comes out is a flawless acting he portrays a bisexual man torn within desires who commits a crime but cannot stand any of the objects that remind him of his victim which represents conscience his bisexuality is indicated through the character of lo spagnolo elio marcuzzo whom he meets in very surprising circumstances in the train for ancona clara calamai who was cast in the role after eminent anna magnani had refused fits very well to the role and we may claim that there is a true chemistry between the couple they are both very convincing besides i liked juan de langa in the role of bragana he portrays an old husband not affectionate to his wife and still crazy about high art in some of his most witty moments he asks his wife to wash his back or walks in the empty streets singing his favorite opera songs after sort of karaoke performance br br in sum we as modern viewers who are capable of critical view have to look at this film very objectively it is art for sure thanks to the aspects aforementioned it is a powerful story as well thanks to the controversy it carries yet is it educational visconti was not fellini who said that he did not carry any message for humanity in such case his films would only entertain which is of course not entirely fellini's style too visconti always had something to convey what did he want to say here is the film against bad marriage or is it against wrong actions of people absorbed by desire the final shocking moments say for themselves though you don't have to agree with the vision ossessione is really a wonderfully realistic film one of visconti's best 8 10
what do you get when you mix a lump of clichés with a directionless pacing and a group of characters who you don't care about and a failed attempt at creating an appealing visual style and an even bigger lump of clichés and a weak sense of humor and a really big budget why you get one of the most intolerably unwatchable movies ever made i'm referring of course to domino br br here are some things that people might say during the viewing of this movie br br ooh wow the storyline is told out of sequence that hasn't been done a billion times before and much more skillfully than in this movie br br wow look at all of the flashing lights and grainy film texture and elaborate transitions the director is trying so hard to make things look arty and to establish a visual style it's just too bad that none of these effects add anything to the movie or make sense with the scenes they're in and it's also too bad that most of them come across as irritating br br i've heard that exchange of dialogue in about twenty thousand movies before br br i've seen this scene in about thirty thousand movies before br br this one too br br uh didn't they reveal this 'plot twist' about half an hour ago was that supposed to be surprising br br if this movie is supposed to be showing a 'tough chick' going around kicking ass when why doesn't she do very much of it br br i can't believe how unoriginal this dialogue is br br how long is this thing i feel like i've been watching it for over four hours already br br i have no idea what just happened but also i don't particularly feel motivated to try to figure it out br br is this over yet br br i want my money back br br the songs in this soundtrack feel so misused here br br it's ironic that all of the cursing they use actually detracts from the impact of each one br br ugh br br and finally i might have to end my friendship with the person who recommended this movie to me br br in summation this movie is a failure in nearly every aspect avoid watching it at all costs if your house is on fire and this movie is playing in the only room that isn't flammable you should seriously consider being burned alive instead br br if i sound bitter it's because i just spent over two hours watching this movie and uh i didn't enjoy it very much
not a woman film' but film for the gang one of the worst films ever made by a male director about woman director andy mckay simply doesn't know woman peaks of bad taste american pie's humor style crude story no sense groundless story refuted characters vulgar fantasies came to life on screen insulting and definitely not funny i wonder how three good actresses accepted to take part in it
what was there about 1939 that helped produce so many excellent hollywood films well whatever it was the magic may also be found in this columbia picture it's a long forgotten screwball comedy that turner classic movies has begun to show maltin's movie book does not contain it in nearly every department amazing mr williams is a jewel br br it's the story of a first rate police detective who can never find the time to marry his intended as the wedding bells are about to ring he gets called to the scene of a murder the lady in question has to learn the hard way not only to enjoy the pursuit of criminals but to belong to the police force there are a lot of laughs in the process br br melvyn douglas proved again that he had few peers in light comedy joan blondell was at the peak of her career and is a delight edward brophy and donald mcbride are hilarious br br the film goes on a bit too long but who cares the screwball comedies are always able to entertain and this film belongs right in there with the best
my husband and i went to see this movie being the horror movie buffs that we are two hours later i found myself wanting both my money and time back i was so disappointed the teasers for this film basically contained the best points of the film there was nothing very scary about the film other than good timing on surprise entrances etc i found most of the 'scary' parts to be more comical than anything after viewing other movies based on the works of japanese writers i have to conclude that what is deemed frightening in japan is not what is frightening here in the us my advice if you are a fan of true horror movies save yourself the pain of sitting through this one i can't really say that i would recommend renting it either unless you have a free rental coming to you
no spoilers here but i have been a fan since waking the dead started but the last series of which only 3 have been on so far is awful the stories bear no resemblance to the original idea of the series i found these 3 in the last series jaw droppingly ludicrous as a bbc licence payer after the show i rang bbc complaints to pass on my disappointment i'm amazed that actors of the calibre of trevor eve and sue johnstone didn't object to the story lines these actors have been with these characters for 8 seasons surly they can see it's lost all direction it's a good job it is the last series or the next series may start with the team investigating the death of father christmas br br paul bentley west yorkshire england
drawing restraint 9 is a kind of movie one either loves or hates fortunately or not i left it with a strong feeling of wasted time and of being thoroughly stuffed with killing whales is bad propaganda aesthetically the movie could have been pleasing especially its first half until it is not clear that every action portrayed serves as an allegory of various aspects of whale hunting until then it might be slightly amusing to look at daily chores of japan workers but later it becomes obvious that anything that appears on the screen is a propaganda and no single frame is an exception i use the word propaganda because the movie uses basically the old morality play device where good and bad are not deduced in the course of action but are set in stone probably it's just me but i find such type of art shallow and preconceived even when it's all about the noble no sarcasm here quest of protecting the environment br br in my opinion it is a cardinal sin when a movie material is stretched out without any justification for the sake of stretching only in my opinion drawing restraint 9 could've been easily fit into 75 minutes but has a torturous length of 2 and 1 4 hours yes there were interesting shots but there were not enough of these to leave 15 minute gaps of nothingness without notice the movie has no standard scenario and there's no evolution of characters but neither it is a documentary it's rather a kind of conceptual installation that's an unusual form for a movie but it still can be viewed as art even when the concept is as simple and naive as here otoh i also believe that the director should've had some honesty and did not pretend that it could be only delivered in no less than 135 minutes br br and yes the music score mostly resembled whale sounds how surprising br br 2 10
i love tudor chirila and maybe that's why i enjoyed the movie so much two days before the movie premiere i went to see his concert i saw the trailer and the video zmeu before the movie and i thought i had it all figured i was wrong instead of a good movie i assisted a great one i felt the movie it was sad it was funny but most of all it pictured love i can't even begin to describe the soundtrack so i won't i'm not a movie critic i can't describe it in more words my kinda vague description is all because the play left me speechless thank god for the keyboard thank you tudor giurgiu thank you maria popistasu thank you ioana barbu and thank you tudor chirila encore
i already loved how the grinch stole christmas when it was released and i'm still loving it now 5 years later still lots of people seem to disagree with my opinion and this movie never really had received much love at the time it came out br br sure the movie is over the top and campy but that at the very same is also the reason why this movie is so charming and fun to watch all of the sets costumes and characters are done perfectly over the top in a fun way without ever becoming truly ridicules it's a visually spectacular movie to watch it's a campy movie making at its very best director ron howard really surprises with this fun little christmas movie br br main reason why the movie works and why it's so much fun to watch is jim carrey as the grinch he truly carries the movie with his good and fun role he is of course helped by the convincing make up which also received an academy award of course if you're a jim carrey hater you shouldn't even think about watching this movie this movie is really his movie and he makes it all work and so much fun to watch other fun and memorable roles are being played by jeffrey tambor clint howard and josh ryan evans as the young grinch br br the movie has a good morale but it is all a bit sappy to me perhaps it's because i'm dutch and we don't really celebrate christmas that enthusiastic and big here as in the united states or england for me the movie was simply fun and entertaining and the morale just left me quite cold to be honest br br the musical score by james horner is good and fun even though it's your average every day horner stuff it still all works perfectly for the movie and helps to make some of the scene's work br br perfect christmas entertainment br br 8 10
i didn't like this bill murray vehicle when it was originally released in the 80s so i tried watching it again to see if my distaste for this film was down to my movie going tastes in the 80s or was it that stripes is simply a bad movie well the verdict is in and stripes is a bad movie br br now stripes may have been innovative comedy in the early 80s and it may appeal to people who have gone through basic training or who are bill murray fans but its still a bad movie br br why is it bad mostly because stripes is supposed to be a comedy but it's just not that funny there are some laughs but they are few and far between most of the movie is consumed by the dramatic plot which is incredibly convoluted and not very interesting this lack of comedy is especially noticeable if you're used to more contemporary comedies such as anchorman which strive for laughs in every part of the movie br br stripes further suffers from bill murray and harold ramis's lack of acting ability bill murray is a great comedian but he was not a very compelling dramatic actor at this point in his career and harold ramis is playing harold ramis these two are just not good enough as actors to carry the dramatic arch of the movie br br lastly most of the comedy that there is in stripes revolves around bill murray's self centered smart alec man child character so if you don't find that character funny like i didn't you're not going to find most of what little comedy there is in stripes funny either br br stripes is very much a movie of its era it hasn't aged well and is not worth watching if you want to watch an early 80's buddy comedy i would recommend stir crazy like stripes the humor in stir crazy is not as fast paced as in contemporary comedies but unlike stripes it has aged much better and as a result is still watchable
a longtime fan of bette midler i must say her recorded live concerts are my favorites bette thrills us with her jokes and brings us to tears with her ballads a literal rainbow of emotion and talent bette shows us her best from her solid repertoire as well as new songs from the bette of roses album spanning generations of people she offers something for everyone the one and only divine diva proves here that she is the most intensely talented performer around
i really like slasher movies but this one is truly awful the acting is lame the script is bad and the atmosphere is non existent the plot is as follows a deformed gardener charlie puckett slaughters people in a small american town that's right this is the plot very original eh the night brings charlie isn't even gory enough if the film ain't gonna be scary at least they should make it bloody avoid this cheap piece of trash at all costs if you want to see some good slasher flicks check out madman the burning the prowler just before dawn or humongous just don't waste your precious time with this worthless piece of garbage
at the beginning i was happy to know about a new superman movie i though that will be great but it wasn't br br is a bad copy of the richard donner work lex is again a villain that makes no more else even played by kevin spice br br the evil plan is the same of the first movie of donner just a lot forced br br the script is predictable and simple all stuff luthor finds in a museum or an old lady br br the story is the wrong thing it must be the kevin smith script and may be it could be better br br i just hope a sequel without brian singer and with a new talent director to do something new and not a copy br br all read you later
hg is normally exploitive and it's never really bothered me before i loved bloodfeast 2 but i really don't like pseudo sciences or playing on heuristics the whole movie is based on a man with esp caused by an electrical accident and a witch i'm not opposed to witches and i liked carrie the novel and the movie but this one bothered me i think it's because of the main character developing esp from an electric line also the university professor wasting his time studying esp cases i wasn't alive in the 60s to know first hand whether or not esp was a common fallacy then but i assume that any theory of such nature would simply be discredited what really bothered me was the way the police were describing schizophrenics as ruthless unpredictable villains who can seem like normal people 99 of the time and then just snap nothing could be further from the truth i detest such concepts because they add to public idiocy many people still think that schizophrenia is dissociative identity disorder whoever wrote this script didn't know much about psychology br br there were some decent concepts to the movie i liked the way the witch used men it was a nice change i liked how she could make herself attractive but didn't when she was around her forced lovers i found it interesting how her second lover also burned his face had the script been touched up for a few weeks before production and not focused solely on making its audience dumber this may have been a decent movie
what makes for best picture material the oscars have come in for a lot of stick for rewarding overblown spectacles that have aged poorly and ignoring the auteurs who would be deified in decades to come it wasn't because hollywood was against art or creativity the academy awards are the selections made by the industry itself and that is why at least in the classic era they tended to reward the greatest collaborations the most sensational meetings of creative minds br br the arthur freed unit at mgm had been bound for oscar winning glory for several years by this point it was only a matter of time before freed aided by his strongest director vincente minnelli and some the finest musical stars in the business would land a best picture freed had arguably done more to raise the status of the musical than anyone else crafting pictures which wove story and song together without losing the dynamic spectacle of the 30s musicals the point about freed musicals is that the lyrics of the songs unlike those of hammerstein or lerner don't have to tell or even relate to the stories what's important is that the tone of the song and the way it is presented fit into the structure of the film br br an american in paris was the first of three freed musicals the other two being singin' in the rain and the band wagon which took existing classic numbers out of their original context and made them work in a completely unrelated story the words don't fit the plot but the routines fit the show so when gene kelly sings i got rhythm he hasn't even got a girl yet but the way it's done with the french kids joining in is a great bit of characterisation and the upbeat tune and dance gives the movie the little lift it needs at this point an american in paris also uses the rule breaking allowed in the genre to add little unconventional flights of fancy to tell the story such as the series of dances which accompany the description of leslie caron's character br br and what better director for this project than minnelli himself a painter and a pianist at this time there wasn't really anyone who had a better feel for technicolor while some directors would saturate each scene in one colour or fill the screen with clashing shades minnelli's colour schemes are tightly controlled but never look forced in the opening scenes the tones are fairly muted but not drab and in particular there is an absence of red during oscar levant and georges guetary's meeting in the café a few more vibrant shades are introduced then during the first musical number by strauss minnelli gradually brings in splashes of red  a table cloth a bunch of roses  until it eventually dominates as if the song has awoken the picture's colour scheme for most of the songs the colours are choreographed as intricately as the people however in some numbers such as tra la la he keeps the shades the same and instead opens out the space as the song swells up and the characters become more animated br br the achilles' heel of an american in paris is its story i personally find the romantic angle particularly unpalatable playing as it does like a last hurrah for the misogynistic love stories that reigned supreme in the 30s the headstrong independent woman gets rejected while the meek delicate girl is harassed into loving the hero even if you don't mind that it is difficult to connect emotionally with the story because it is constantly overshadowed by the songs and dances compare this to singin' in the rain which doesn't really have as many great routines or memorable set pieces as an american in paris but it has a winning storyline singin' in the rain was overlooked at the 1952 oscars yet it is regarded as a classic of the genre today but i think people sometimes forget that cinema is an all encompassing form of visual entertainment not just a means of telling a story an american in paris is not deep or engaging or tear jerking but like a certain demille picture that won the top award the following year it certainly is a great show
i saw this movie in new york city i was waiting for a bus the next morning so it was 2 or 3 in the morning it was raining and did not want to wait at the port authorty so i went across the street and saw the worst film of my life it was so bad that i chose to stay and see the whole movie i have yet to see anything else that bad since the year was 69 so call me crazy i stayed only because i could not belive it
there were a lot of films made by hollywood during the war years that were designed to drum up support for our troops from the public seen today some might dismiss them or just see them as propaganda which they technically are but of a positive sort and meant to unify the nation this film is a pretty effective and entertaining example of the genre having a pretty realistic script and good production values pat o'brien plays pretty much the same character he played in many other films you know the tough talking hard driven but swell guy randolph scott is as always competent and entertaining and the rest of the extras are excellent look for a young robert ryan as one of the bombardiers in training while the story is reminiscent of several other movies about our pilots and crews the film is well crafted enough to make it interesting and not too far fetched that it perhaps except for the very end where the film is a bit over the top but also very satisfying about the only serious negative and this is mostly for nitpickers is that some of the stock footage is somewhat sloppily integrated in the film and nuts like me who are both history teachers and airplane lovers will probably notice this all others probably won't notice
this is ostensibly a movie about multiple grief as such it ought to move viewers and make them empathetic with the plight of the main characters however its irritatingly postmodern style makes it almost incomprehensible the camera continually switches from one scene to another from one personal crisis to the next creating a choppy disjointed effect most characters appear to live aimless unstructured lives held together by their professional commitments it also stretches credibility that a man who has just been given what amounts to a likely death sentence would cheerfully indulge in a sex romp with a woman he has just met the storyline if there is a storyline is difficult to follow in sum the overall effect is rather disappointing in spite of all that the acting is generally good and some of the scenes are quite powerful
an innocent man steve guttenberg has a one night stand with his boss's wife isabelle huppert she spots a woman elizabeth mcgovern being attacked outside but she can't call the cops because it would blow her marriage to gutenberg's boss paul shenar so guttenberg honest citizen that he is when he discovers that another woman was attacked and killed nearby only half an hour later comes forward and claims to have witnessed the first attack merely intending to pass on the information given to him by huppert well never bear false witness against thy neighbor as they say br br this simple attempt to help the police nab a murderer turns rapidly twisted when he meets the first near victim mcgovern she immediately twigs to what happened but agrees to keep quiet for the moment but then guttenberg finds himself in court supposed to identify the heavy greenquist and we discover through cross examination that he is near sighted and can't identify objects at a distance let alone faces not that it matters because after all he never saw the creep in the first place the plot gets practically labyrinthine guttenberg winds up the chief suspect when huppert is murdered too br br he barely escapes arrest and holes up with the now sympathetic mcgovern guttenberg and mcgovern hatch a plan to trap the murderer she will serve as bait they'll follow the flagitious creep into one of his seedy haunt and mcgovern will act like the doxy that the murderer is attracted to just to get him to try to kill her but everything will be okay see because not only will guttenberg keep a close watch on her and not only will he alert the police a few minutes after she enters this dive but she will keep a can of mace handy just in case br br i ask you the alert viewer does this scenario unfold as planned elizabeth mcgovern has a quirkily interesting bone structure she seems all mandible and tiny mouth at times but she's vibrant steve guttenberg has hair on his brawn and that's about it otherwise he's as helpless as the character he plays if isabelle huppert can act it isn't evident in this film the killer is so formed and so groomed that he looks like he's wearing one of those masks of deformity in that twilight zone episode about greedy heirs br br didn't the director curtis hanson go on to make l a confidential that was a nicely done piece of work here everything seems clumsy and contrived down to the small bit parts just before the inevitable violent climax a uniformed police officer is introduced to delay mcgovern's rescue and the scene is embarrassing to watch dick olsen has a bit part as a late shopper he's a neat guy and always reliable paul shenar as the cuckolded hubby has a striking face that seems made for the stage and he does a fine job too br br that louche joint where mcgovern attracts the attention of the murderer where she plays pool with a couple of hairy apes was shot at a bar in carolina beach in north carolina not far from where i lived the way the interior is set up it's clear that this is supposed to be a dangerous and dirty dive actually it appears rather more elegant on screen than it did in reality br br overall this is hitchcock territory and it brings tears to the eyes to imagine what he would have done with this story
i have seen a lot of bad movies with big actors in it but this movie was terrible i have yet to see why people thought it was funny the idea behind it is stupid plus all the things that are supposed to be funny are just dumb why anyone would want to watch this more than once just baffles me
this movie does not rock as others have said i found it really boring and silly the story is about this metal high school kid who idolizes this really bad heavy metal singer the singer dies but not before making one last album that is to be played over the radio at of course midnight on halloween which would actually make it november 1st a much less potent date to be sure the kid gets a copy of the record and it contains secret hidden back play messages it also is the key that opens the door so that the really bad metal singer can return to bring havoc and death to the world br br the first part of this film is not a horror film at all but rather an after school special we see the metal kid the outsider tormented over and over by the popular kids and he fails to learn the most important lesson in high school movies when the cool kids who bully you suddenly invite you to a party don't go it is a trap especially if it is a pool party anybody surprised when he ends up in the water it was such an after school special that i kept waiting for melissa sue anderson to show up and teach jody foster a lesson br br so back to the horror part of the film so this metal kid gets some powers and instead of using them to kill the bully boys which would have made much more sense he freaks out and tries to protect all of the bully boys and girls from harm what a sensitive hero what fun is that in a horror movie thank goodness carrie white did not follow this lesson he actually tries to prevent having the music played at the halloween dance the very music that could unleash a power to kill all the kids who had been mean to him if it were me i would have put that music on and pronto br br the rest of the movie is about this metal kid going around town trying to kill the horrible metal star he idolized why not partner with him and really do some damage why you ask it seems he is in love with one of the popular girls and does not want her hurt more appropriate for a molly ringwald film is this a horror film or an episode of beauty and the beast the movie just goes on and on at this point with no scares horror or anything worth watching if you went to high school in the late 80s like i did this movie is fun to have a little flashback to fashions and big hair but that is it for this film skip it and stay home and just listen to some kiss
great battle finale and nice sets help keep this often slow movie enjoyable at times it had me checking my watch although there were enough memorable moments to make the film stand out in my mind days after watching it the ending should surprise even those familiar with the nibelungen story line
attack of the killer tomatoes consists mostly of rambling poorly assembled footage in search of a movie the plot makes no sense and the various characters drop in and out of the picture with no explanation at all watching this silly spoof you get the feeling than so many other comments have captured so accurately that it's easy to make a cheap low quality film and then use the parody angle as an excuse for its cheapness and low quality in one scene female swimmers are terrified of tomatoes that are floating near them how far can suspension of disbelief go even in a parody the title song is great though 1 2
near the beginning of the godfather part iii michael corleone's son wants to drop out of law school and become a musician michael corleone does not want this but his estranged ex wife kay manages to convince him to let anthony corleone pursue music as he wishes so he does br br that seems like an odd way to start a review as it is a minor plot point and has nothing really to do with the major action just bear with me here you'll see where i'm going with this eventually now let me tell you about the major plot it is about michael corleone wanting to quit crime for good he has largely abandoned all criminal elements in his family business but then along comes vincent mancini an illegitimate nephew who is involved in a feud so of course michael must endure yet another brush with criminality and gun violence and all that good gangster stuff meanwhile vincent has a semi incestuous affair with michael's daughter mary oh and michael and kay are trying to patch up all the horrid things that happened at the end of part ii br br it is like a soap opera one horrid awful 169 minute soap opera gone is any sort of the sophistication romance and emotional relevance that made the first two movies hit home so hard after a 16 year break in the franchise francis ford coppola delivered a mess of sop and pretentiousness entirely incongruous with the first two films once again proving his last great work was apocalypse now back in the 1970's br br what's worse the godfather part iii isn't even a logical follow up of the godfather part ii michael is a completely different person he hasn't just gone to seed which might be legitimate even if it'd be no fun to watch he's become a goody goody that's trying to fix all the tragedy that made part ii such a devastating masterpiece his confession to the priest was bad enough but that little diabetes attack in the middle pushed it over to nauseating he also gets back together with kay for heaven's sakes there is absolutely no way that should happen as the 2nd movie made abundantly clear she aborted his baby and his sicilian upbringing made him despise her for it didn't francis ford coppola even think of these things br br and don't even get me started on mary and vincent's affair for a romance so forbidden it was shockingly unengaging sofia coppola's acting did nothing to help she made the smartest move of her life when she switched from in front of the camera to behind it because she was possibly the worst actress i have ever seen in a best picture nominee every line she delivered was painfully memorized and every time the drama rested on her acting abilities all she elicited was inappropriate giggles in the climactic scene i won't go into detail but you'll know which scene i'm talking about when if you watch it she looks at michael and says daddy i think i was meant to cry but the line was delivered so poorly i burst out into long loud laughter br br now we get to the climax and now you will also realize why i took time to start the review with a description of anthony corleone's musical ambitions after 140 minutes of petty drama and irrelevant happenstances anthony corleone returns with an opera so michael kay mary and vincent go to see it and for about 10 15 minutes a couple killers walk around trying to assassinate michael about this climactic sequence i must say one thing it was really good but not because of the killers they were pretty boring i just really liked the opera it had some great music and real great set pieces and from what little it showed us it seemed that the story had echoes of the corleone family's origin i'll bet it was one swell opera and i'll bet michael corleone was glad he let his son switch from law school to music br br my biggest wish is this that francis ford coppola had merely filmed anthony corleone's opera for 169 minutes and ditched the rest of the soggy melodrama better yet i wish he hadn't made the godfather part iii at all part ii gave us the perfect ending this spin off was self indulgent and unnecessary br br p s this is not a gut reaction to the film i watched all 3 godfather films over a month ago though i was rewatching the first one not only does this mean that my expectations for part iii weren't screwed in fact i had set the bar rather low for it after what i heard but it also means i've had a good time to think about all three films while i was a bit disappointed with part ii at first the more i thought about it the better it seemed but with part iii it was bad to begin with then got worse the more i thought about it the sad thing is that many people will stop with part i but if they watch part ii as well they will most likely go on to part iii if you have the will watch parts i ii and pretend like part iii never existed
i love zombie movies and i love amateur productions and meat market 2 starts really promising with a nice homage to fulci´s classic zombi br br so i leaned back and waited to be impressed okay some of the makeups are great for such a no budget movie and some actors the vampirelady and the cook really stand out but else there´s nothing br br i didn´t expect a new romero here but there is not one sequence in the whole movie which has even a little bit of suspense or shock value the director sure knows how to stage body rippings and interesting eating habits but now after two parts it´s time to learn something more br br in meatmarket2 gore rhymes with bore for me that´s not enough sorry br br out of
i just couldn't stop laughing this movie is incredibly funny and stupid but never mind that it is very entertaining in this film you don't need to pay attention to anything the acting is the same lame the dinosaurs are the same rubber oh my i could see the stick that holds t rex head for a moment the raptors are the same from the carnosaur 2 t rex is also the same but in some scenes his head looks kinda stuffed and it looks like some kind of project failure from kindergarten action is fast sometimes too fast actually i talk about fast editing they edited it so fast so that we cannot see the rubber dinosaurs but oopps to late they are rubber well only things interesting here is to see rick dean in this sequel br br what can i say don't rent it watch it on tv with friends it is much more entertaining
i find it so amazing that even after all these years we are still talking about this movie obviously this movie wasn't that bad or else people wouldn't even bother to talk about it i personally enjoyed this film immensly and still do i guess this film isn't for everyone but it certainly did touch the hearts of many br br as for those that think that this film is overrated or over hyped well we only have the movie going public to thank for that lol you see it's not critics article writers that make a film huge or a hit with the general movie going public people make the film a huge success with titanic everyone was in awe let's face it a film like this had never been made before at least not with the type of special effects needed to really capture the essence of the ship actually sinking this film is so accurate that even james cameron timed the actual sinking of the ship in the film with the real sinking that fateful day in april 1912 even the silverware for goodness sakes matched br br give this movie a break you guys the critics thought this movie would sink big time when this movie actually came out and people started hearing by word of mouth which is the best form of advertisement mind you that this was a good decent movie worth seeing then everyone started flocking to the theaters in droves to see this movie not once not twice but maybe 3 times and more so i really wouldn't say that this movie was overhyped at least not like the buildup for the matrix reloaded or the hulk is being overhyped ha critics didn't even think that titanic would make enough money to cover cameron's gigantic film budget that it took to make this mammoth of a film however the films money took care of that 200 million budget and much more br br personally i love this film however this film might not be for everyone don't say that this film sucks just because of romance though that is the most sexist thing i've ever heard disliking a movie just because it has romance in it the story was sweet the dialogue could have been better but let's face it the real star of the movie wasn't leo or kate it was that gigantic ship i think all of the actors including dicaprio and winslet did a fine job it's not thier best work i've seen much better work from both of them but it wasn't the worst i've seen on screen before give them a break br br
ok who brought the cheese i love it during it's run it became a phenomenon the anorexic twins became popular bob saget started making a paycheck instead of his really funny stand up and people knew who dave coulier was this is when life was good and simple this is one of the great american classics it was humorous and always brought home a good lesson and this is where i differ from the norm i liked the last few seasons like home improvement when children get older there are a lot more you can do with the script this is why i dare say it could have gone much later than it did but anyway i gave it an 8 10 because of its wholesome funny story lines and because of bob saget
brilliant film the next best film to the drunken master jackie chan i recently bought it on an original vhs and i haven't seen this film for 15 years but still as good as it was back then the acting was terrible and the dubbing was even worse but it those features that make this film and many other old fashioned chinese kung fu movies great the choreography is awesome and the storyline is basic i have never seen the 36th chamber of shaolin but know it is the same film but gordon liu plays san te but san te in thr return to the 36th chamber is played by a different character it has a lot of comedy value and brilliant kung fu
here's why the jane show won't work once again canadian bonehead producers and writers can't create a sitcom without putting some kind of different spin on it i guess these people don't watch a lot of t v from the u s which has the sitcom model down pat no here we have to do something different we have to make the a story absolutely absurd and then have a meaningful b story to try to make up for it the characters are two dimensional and the story lines are way over the top forklift races give me freaking break here's a little advice for the writers of the show don't write funny situations find the funny in situations and remember you have to be born with a sense of humor to write truly funny stuff not just be an improv monkey
to say funky forest the first contact is a bad movie is an understatement of incredible proportions i can really get into a good art house film even a surreal and twisted romp like el topo naked lunch and survive style 5 because those movies actually have something worth discussing when the credits roll br br fffc attempts at every avenue to be this deep and intellectual essentially there is no substance in this movie this movie is badly done the visuals in this movie are not inspiring the dialog is worse the musical numbers destroy this movie i chuckled for guitar brothers but that was immediately wiped out by something completely unnecessary and irrelevant it attempted to be deep and meaningful i think but its just pretentious disoriented nonsense freshman film students without a camera could craft something more interesting br br guitar brothers and the stand up routines in between skits get 1 point each everything else is just badly paced pseudo creative heavy handed attempts at being as good as films by other real directors like sogo ishii david lynch and jodoworsky give me a break i am convinced that people that rave about fffc are doing so because they have no idea of what they saw because it was nothing but mild pertinent statements here and there mixed with stupidity and blended until you puke on your own shoes br br this movie was an extreme disappointment coming off the high that was survive style 5 a film that actually has meaning combined with excellent use of scenery cinematography catchy dialog funny moments good soundtrack excellent performances fantastic pacing and flow fffc features the exact opposite in every way boring scenery 20 minutes staring at a bland beach at night a completely white stage alien balls floating in white space a dinky school hallway and then a school hallway terrible cinematography forgettable dialog nothing funny or humorous save the fact you just wasted your life for two hours soundtrack amateurish performances uneven disjointed and often flat out dragging pacing zero flow whatsoever br br there are those that claim this is what makes fffc a great movie that it is so unconventional at every turn that its pure genius this is simply a way to stroke your own ego it seems because unpredictable could be a good quality for a film if it wasn't coupled with boring innane and terrible personally i have spoken with two people who admitted to me that fffc was terrible when they left the theater but overwhelming rave by art house elitist made them watch the movie again and then come back to me with a hey it was pretty good i liked it br br i'm going to put my foot down this movie is slop i don't care if roger ebert says this film is the best thing he's ever watched since he lost his own virginity the emperor's new cloak i say this movie is no way indicative of the other psychedelic trippy films to come from japan in the last 10 years taste of tea party 7 and kamikaze girls are much better movies even with a low budget and none can honestly compare with survive style 5 watch fffc only if your interested in making a pretentious pile of nothing on a shoestring budget
hopelessly inept and dull movie in which the characters stand around in rooms or a rocket ship and talk endlessly you might think things would perk up when they explore mars but these scenes are filmed through a heavy red orange filter which makes everything very murky the martian landscape vegetation consists mainly of drawings and the monsters are entirely unconvincing there are echoes of 'bride of the monster' when the heroine carefully winds the octopus like tentacle of a flesh eating plant around her before weakly thrashing about the difference being that the ed wood film is a hundred times more entertaining better wear earplugs when watching otherwise the 'sci fi' music score repeated endlessly will drive you insane if you find yourself unable to sleep one night just slip this one into the vcr and your insomnia will be cured in no time
goldeneye will always go down as one of thee most legendary games in vg history their is no doubt about that but this game although quite different could quite possibly be the modern day bond champ of its time br br this was not a bond game based on material from another medium this was a completely new scripted game which even had its own theme song wouldnt be bond without it haha gameplay was excellent and if you're a fan of the bond games or films alike you'll enjoy it br br unlike some most games these cast members portrayed their characters themselves as opposed to fictional creations for the game which gives it that more cinematic feel with a very 'bond' able storyline you feel like you're in the game as much as you get lost in a movie br br enjoyable in all aspects from start to finish even after beating the game there's still plenty more to be done with the ranking system and unlockables to be achieved as well as its multi player missions this is a stand out game despite being quite old now in video game years it's still a good game that you can pick up play whenever you feel the need to get a little more bond in your life even now just thinking about it i've got the theme song stuck in my head such a great cast and well written storyline br br the story comes to life on the screen almost as if the actors were their in front of you and is every bit as entertaining as the game itself superbly done in true bond fashion which can only be named awesome completely awesome br br i've gotta go throw this game on now if you haven't played it yet you're missing out
the killings in this movie isn't that bad but for sure the movie is it's even worse than that it's not even worth the wear it might cause when you slide it into your dvd player br br not even the wear it causes on your shoulders carrying it from the dvd store not to speak of the money and time you spend renting and watching it horrible br br it's beyond understanding how anyone could say anything positive about this movie it was just a bare masochistic tendency of mine that caused me not to stop watching add to that the group pressure from my co watchers br br the manuscript is awful the directing even worse and the acting is plain despicable br br i hope you don't see this as a spoiling your fun i'd rather see it as a fair warning do not waste your time watching this garbage
despite the acclaim on the dvd cover of the version i borrowed this film was a disappointment yes it is far more realistic than other war films of the period for depicting the mud boredom and frustration of the grunt but unfortunately one comes away from it thinking that's all there is to this movie there is no plot and the dialogue is monotonous it's not that a good war film needs to have a battle scene every five minute one of the best world war ii films twelve o'clock high has very little action but it compensates with crackling dialogue and psychological tension the exception to the story of g i joe is a brief battle segment titled city under siege on the dvd which takes place in italy admittedly it is one of the most fast paced and convincing combat scenes of any war movie but alas the rest of the film is not worth watching just for this highlight another turn off is pvt dondaro played by wally cassell who is meant to be a romeo but comes off a pervert by contrast sgt warnicki is a sympathetic if flawed man as he says to capt walker mitchum when volunteering for another patrol every step forward is a step closer to home but that last step  one patrol too many  drives him over the mental brink too bad the rest of the movie doesn't do justice to some otherwise fine touches as for meredith's portrayal of pyle it is practically comatose
the college girl murders is my first acquaintance with the writing work of edgar wallace  and generally my first real acquaintance with krimi films in general  and i can say that i'm moderately impressed this stuff is really entertaining although i never would have expected it to be so  goofy the film has an exhilarating and nicely convoluted plot with a healthy dose of humor flamboyant twists and pretty inventive killings there's some james bond type of evil mastermind  who always sits in the shadow and in front of a large monitor recruiting prisoners to kill certain girls at a specific college with a new type of poison there's also a villainous monk with a whip dressed like a communist kkk member getting rid of the leftover characters like overly curious teachers and such as well as a kooky police commissioner who persists on solving the case with a psychological approach seriously if i had known sooner that these krimi films were so colorful and crazy i would have purchased a whole collection of them already the pretzel plot actually raises more questions than it answers in the end and the overload of comical gimmicks on the account of scotland yard inspector higgins are sometimes a bit much to swallow but i don't care because it was sublime entertainment even the funky 60's soundtrack remained stuck in my head for a long time it's like a variant on the italian giallo but with slapstick elements
if you think weird al yankovic is hilarious you won't be disappointed by the compleat al not only does this rare mockumentary feature many of yankovic's more memorable videos like a surgeon and i love rocky road among them but they are inter spliced with funny vignettes supposedly highlighting the parodist's rise to fame yankovic is not for all tastes but his humor is harmless and imaginative enough that even non fans will at least be lightly amused die hard fans will love it not only for its content but also for its relatively early look into yankovic's now nearly three decade career suitable for all ages kiddies will no doubt love the funny visuals
in joel schumacher you have one of the most inconsistent film makers of all time but this is common knowledge i think his main problem is the array of genres that he covers whilst at the same time failing to develop any sort of certain style that might label him an auteur hitchcock liked his suspense and his horror thriller chaplin liked his comedy scorsese likes his crime driven mafia stories amongst others and spielberg likes his large scale big budget adventure films that combine just enough violence for the adults and fun for the kids other more obscure examples include kubrick and welles who covered too much to write about here br br but schumacher is the sort of guy who makes a flawed film revolving around a great idea or a really quite enjoyable film revolving around a seemingly dull premise falling down had a great idea behind it but i found it flawed and anticlimactic with too many scenes seemingly relying on comedy batman is a superhero superhero films have been big hits recently so how he managed to make not one but two appalling superhero films is beyond me then comes 8mm a film with a basic premise that is executed in an impressive manner before tigerland which is schumacher's best film from what i've so far seen in my opinion with the war genre laughter isn't something you'd associate with it for most of the time i can remember scoffing at the absurdity of the d day landings during saving private ryan at the time when i first saw the film i had not much knowledge of the second world war bar when it began and finished my eyebrows were up my mouth slightly open with a weak 'i can't believe it smile' on my face needless to say it was because of that film i searched out learning a bit more on what that event was all about and the war as a whole in tigerland you are invited to laugh at the absurdity of war through bozz farrell a tough and egotistical soldier training for the vietnam war br br but what's clever here is that there are no jaw dropping war scenes of fighting and death and destruction just one man and his battle with the system for most of the time the things he says and the audacity at which he deals with his predicament is reminiscent of a school child winding up a series of teachers at an extremely strict boarding school tigerland may borrow from full metal jacket in the sense it is a training routine for the vietnam war but egos and superegos play more of a part here i think the superegos that are the drill sergeants go up against bozz whose ego is extremely large there is also the third part of freud's triangle that sneaks into bozz the id compared to all the other soldiers who all have rather large egos bozz is the only one brave enough to show it in front of the sergeants thus suggesting he is allows what he shouldn't do to float to the surface and express itself you are all dead in this situation barks a sergeant any questions yeah if i'm dead how come i can ask a question replies bozz whose punishments such as push ups and dirt eating seem to un faze him in true id style that is he enjoys the punishments br br also regarding the superegos bozz at one point tries to command a group of soldiers in field training this is something the existing captain of the squad cannot do thus suggesting he is lacking in both the superego required for the job and the confidence to tell bozz he is in charge what follows is an actual conversation between bozz and an existing drill sergeant who gives him his christian name this is where private wilson's whigham character steps in his uncontrollable rage and anger at bozz explodes at certain time all culminating in the film's only real scenes of a shootout which is in the form of a training exercise in a river wilson cannot control his impulses and dislike toward bozz and acts out br br what i also liked about tigerland is that it's shot in such a way that is brave while lacking in innovation tigerland seems to use lower grade film stock or lesser cameras to get across its gritty look make no mistake that this could have been a pretty looking film with lots of colour and attractiveness but we get a documentary approach in the final piece making everything look like it was shot on a typical everyday camera for tv the emphasis on the hand held is also apparent but schumacher is clever he never allows the film to become too much like a mockumentry whilst at the same time suggesting the film's budget could've been half of what it was it's worth saying here that spielberg said he wanted saving private ryan to look like actual reel footage or something along those lines and as if it was recorded from the war scenes br br while being very funny and entertaining tigerland is still a great study of what makes people tick not necessarily in war but in the closest possible substitute its study on one man and how much he hates the system that he cannot even take it seriously is fascinating as is the drive of each soldier there are several memorable scenes and situations culminating in a happy if not unhappy ending that'll open your mind and make you think about what it's perhaps really like in the military
okay this film is about bedknobs and broomsticks it's one of the most charming delightful movies you'll ever see as a kid it's the unforgettable movie about two adults and two spunky kids on an adventure for fun it may be a little deniable to watch but try it i neither my mother didn't think it was bad i was very enthused with the movie and the animation they were all quite good br br it is a delightfully wondrous comedy for the whole family to enjoy even the kids ages 7 years and up will enjoy this wonderful musical comedy with you and your family especially the animation the animation movements and layouts are really nice and deserve a thumbs up it's a terrifically good musical for the whole family so what are you waiting for go to the video store and rent bedknobs and broomsticks now
i watched this film a few times in the 90's and nearly split my sides laughing each time i love eddie murphy as an actor but this stand up is some thing else he is so funny even the p c brigade would find this hilarious it's a must watch and even better if you've got the guys or girls in for a drink the take off of michael jackson is so like him if you close your eyes you believe it's him singing the things he describes are true to life and you would seriously have to have a humour bypass if you thought this was not funny my local video stores do not stock this video any more but i would love to get my hands on a copy to show my husband and boys when they are old enough to appreciate the humour anyway highly recommended hope you enjoy
and not in a good way baseketball is a waste of film in all most every single way it is offensive to all the senses this doesn't necessarily bother me i've seen plenty of bad movies really bad movies before and will see them again baseketball though is a caliber film where you regret wasting ninety minutes of life sitting through it the reason baseketball offends me is that it stars trey parker and matt stone in a film they didn't write any respect i had for david zucker has long since depleted his recent spoof films are lazy messes that look and feel as if they were made by pre pubescent boys snickering at penis jokes airplane was a revolutionary and very funny comedy watching baseketball you will be amazed to discover that they were made by the same person br br i have so much respect for trey parker and matt stone these men are the funniest and smartest comedians in mainstream entertainment today their pictures and south park episodes are as relevant as they are funny every joke even the fart jokes have intelligence behind them it's easy to forget that there is a mature way to approach immaturity i imagine baseketball was a major growing experience for them because they hate the film for all the right reasons it is a stupid mess with no sense of dignity or class parker and stone have essentially whored themselves out the film plays like a 90 minute episode of family guy br br parker and stone have never been great actors they've been serviceable in their films i can't really find a way to describe their performance in baseketball other than the fact that it feels like they are spoofing a spoof film spoofing a spoof film every line is delivered in such a silly winking way it's like they are trying to make fun of the worst of these type of pictures and yet they become them in the same way i am reminded of the south park episode how to eat with your butt where cartman sits in a movie theater watching a gross out comedy with no plot or plausibility except to gross out parker and stone use the same voices they did in that scene for this entire picture really it's sad br br and yet that is not my problem with baseketball my biggest gripe with the picture is that i sit there knowing that parker and stone are knowingly following this piece of crap script i know that if they took the damn thing and rewrote it that this could have been salvaged to the point of being watchable there isn't any indication that zucker let them improv scenes either parker and stone are merely tools to a bad director baseketball has some funny concepts and i think parker especially if he were allowed to take zuckers script could have elaborated on them more instead we get potty humor don't rent baseketball you can get the same laughs watching a group of grade schoolers joking around
this movie probably had a 750 budget and still managed to surpass titanic i rented this the day i crashed my mom's car and it was the only thing that cheered me up beyond belief it has to be tied with 'the assult of the killer bimbos' things to look for are 1 the drive in blow job chinese girl scene 2 the bleach blonde in the sassoon shirt who never changes 3 the flinstone like screech out driving 4 the clashing ensemble worn by the redhead right before she gets killed don't worry i'm not ruining any surprises for it's soooo predictable 5 the guy who finds it necessary to howl 6 the mental patient who plays a convincing job of being insane by poking out the eyes of a maniquen 7 the hour long chase at the end involving the teacher and the priest 8 the womman writing grafitti on the bathroom wall 9 last but not least the wonderful special effects especially the stab in the boob that made a heaven help me popping noise br br enjoy br br
bonanza had a great cast of wonderful actors lorne greene pernell whitaker michael landon dan blocker and even guy williams as the cousin who was brought in for several episodes during 1964 to replace adam when he was leaving the series the cast had chemistry and they seemed to genuinely like each other that made many of their weakest stories work a lot better than they should have it also made many of their best stories into great western drama br br like any show that was shooting over thirty episodes every season there are bound to be some weak ones however most of the time each episode had an interesting story some kind of conflict and a resolution that usually did not include violence while bonanza was a western the gunfighting was never featured as the main attraction while i am a fan of the rifleman and wanted dead or alive those shows usually ended with a gunfight gunfights were how many westerns resolved every conflict and bonanza was very different in trying to seek peaceful resolutions and harmony instead of killing br br in the early years of bonanza there are some interesting episodes that do feature a lot of gunfights those episodes stand in contrast to the rest of the series but they are pretty good in and of themselves in 1964 when pernell whitaker wanted to leave the show guy williams was brought in to replace him williams was playing the role of a long lost cousin unfortunately whitaker decided to stay one more year and thus williams was written out of the series when he moved away to marry adam's old girlfriend if williams had stayed on for the duration of bonanza one can only wonder how much better the series would have been in the years after 1965 when pernell whitaker left the show br br undoubtedly once pernell whitaker left the series the stories focused more on comedy and country hijinks whitaker had often played the heavy in many episodes and his absence left a void in the cast little joe always wanted to play the nice kid and hoss always wanted to play the good old boy with a heart of gold since ben was the kind and wise patriarch of the family that did not leave too much room for any gunfights br br at some point they hired a ranch hand called candy david canary who became their fourth member of the cast but candy was never featured in any gunfights and he was hardly more than an older version of little joe for a year or two they also had ben take in some other lost cousin jamie played by the forgettable mitch vogel who was a teenager that was usually getting into some kind of trouble with someone br br apparently by adding the teenager the studio was looking to attract younger viewers it also gave the writers a chance to write episodes about teenage problems alcohol delinquency etc those kind of preachy episodes were popular in the 1960s as a reaction of the establishment media to the counter culture movement dragnet was probably the most popular source of law and order tv though hawaii 5 0 the f b i and many other shows also tried to jump on the bandwagon by doing tv shows that featured irresponsible teenagers causing mischief mayhem and crime br br the addition of a teenager to the cast gave the cartwrights more chances to show up and solve problems but those episodes feel very contrived and are not very good in general after dan blocker died the series limped along for another year or so before it was canceled the last season was pretty bad as it featured little joe tracking down the killers of his wife and most of the episodes were somewhat depressing because little joe was usually drinking or otherwise remembering how much he loved his wife and how unfair it was that she was killed br br i don't think i have ever seen the last episode of the series and i wonder if they ever officially wrapped it up in some way by the last year there was only ben lorne greene actually living on the ponderosa as adam had moved away and never came back even once as a guest and hoss had died and little joe had left after his wife in the series had been killed by drifters br br overall the era from 1959 1965 is the best of this series once adam left it slowly declined most of the shows before 1970 are pretty good too by 1970 the series was trying to hard to be hip and topical and it had lost a lot of its western flavor the addition of candy and the teenage kid also diluted the general quality of the show and the death of hoss dan blocker was the final nail bonanza is probably the best western series ever made and of the 465 episodes that were produced at least one hundred of them are excellent western drama that is a pretty good record even the worst of bonanza is better than a lot of other tv shows

director brian yuzna has had an uneven career in the horror genre creating masterpieces such as return of the living dead 3 or bride of re animator but at the same time he has done awful movies such as faust love for the damned or the mediocre progeny he is obviously better in the seat of producer where his work producing stuart gordon's films has been superb br br the dentist is one of his lesser works as director but the low profile it has benefits the film and its lack of pretensions makes it a very enjoyable experience it tells the story of dr alan feinstone played superbly by corbin bernsen a successful dentist who one day discovers that his perfect life is not really as perfect as he thought when he discovers that his beautiful wife linda hoffman has an affair with the pool boy this event disturbs his mind and puts him in a killing spree as he takes revenge on the world for being so filthy br br the premise is very well handled by yuzna as he takes us on a ride following feinstone's day of revenge what makes this movie different from most slashers is that we are not in the victim's perspective we follow feinstone because he is the main character we witness how he goes from respected professional to psycho murder in a day yuzna manages to give the movie the exact amount of suspense but adds a good dose of dark humor that really helps the movie br br most of the success of the premise is in bernsen's performance as feinstone he can make you feel sympathy and hate towards him at the same time and the subtle humor his character has is another aspect that aids the film the rest of the cast is not as good and i think that their sub par acting hurts the film more than it should a notable exception is ken foree as the detective trying to catch feinstone while his part is quite small he makes a great job with it br br with a dentist as killer gory scenes are expected and brian yuzna delivers great sfx in the correct amount it's good to see that he does not go over the top with it as he usually do and i dare to say that this is a highlight of the film it has the exact amount of gore that is expected nothing less and nothing more yuzna restrained himself of his common excesses and the result is great br br while this is not among yuzna's most well known films i would say that it is one of his best sure it is not classic material as his masterpieces but it is a movie that entertains and never gets tiresome or boring it is a low budget simple film but for what it is i think it rocked 7 10
i was waiting to see this movie from a long time it's promos gave a fair idea about the content and when i finally saw it i really find it was quite well made most of the conventional romantic movies end with the lovers finally getting married or start of with a happy life after marriage but there is really a great adjustment needed for this transition from an old life to a new relation and life this is what this movie is all about the period when a newly wed couple fardeen and esha get married through an arranged marriage and start off their life with their honeymoon the acting is really spell binding though i think esha remained a bit quiet and she could have used some lines for herself the story was well knitted and dialogs were more or less appropriate the editing and direction were also good meghna gulzar really did a good job here to summarize i would say it is a good drama cum romance a true combination of what bollywood can offer a clean entertainer
anybody who has ever been a fan of the original series or even has a clue about the storyline should be embarrassed by this series the borg does not come around until q brings the enterprise to the gamma sector the klingons are never seen until kirk encounters them the ncc 1701 was the first ship to carry the enterprise name need i go on berman and pilliar have made a mockery of gene roddenberry's creation after he died they only saw and just went their own way no wonder majel barrett was in every single episode of star trek until this series i don't blame her for not being involved with this mess poor bakula he's a great actor as are the entire cast i like them all but the storyline is tragic and ignores all of the precedents set by the original series just check the ratings i think more people watched deep space 9 which was untimely canceled
this cecil b demille epic of the old west contains what may be jean arthur's finest performance as a hysterical eccentric incurably amoral but devotedly doting calamity jane she really pulled it off gary cooper is at his most taciturn but manages some occasional pithy sayings 'the plains are big but trails cross sometimes ' the story is a pastiche to end all pastiches all the cowboy heroes of western lore seem to be in there somehow except for jesse james even abraham lincoln opens the story in person or at least demille would have us believe so there is no room for anything so evanescent as subtlety this is a 'stomp 'em in the face' tale for the masses a remarkable thing about this film however is that it is a very early full frontal attack on what eisenhower was eventually to name 'the military industrial complex' it isn't just a story about gun runners but about arming anyone for money and doing so from the heart of washington but let's not get into politics let's leave that to demille who can be guaranteed to be superficial the chief interest of this film all these years later is that it uses the first film score composed by george antheil who has a lot to say about the job in his autobiography 'bad boy of music' antheil seems to have originated 'the big sound' adopted by all subsequent westerns whereby the plains sing out with the voices and sounds of countless cowboys in the sky celebrating the open spaces and interweaving common melodies that is why it does not sound at all unusual because we have heard it a thousand times but he seems to have been the first to summon up the combined rustlings of all the sage brush into this symphony of the open skies which has entered into american mythic lore and given it a soundtrack which has never varied since then corny as it may be but doubtless appropriate it is amusing to see anthony quinn in an early appearance as a cheyenne indian gabby hayes is in there somewhere but you miss him in the crowd gary cooper overtops them all looming large but when did he ever loom small
basing a television series on a popular author's works is no guarantee of success yorkshire television learnt this the hard way when in 1979 they bought the rights to the books credited to dick francis three of which were broadcast under the collective title 'the racing game' mike gwilym was sid halley a former jockey turned private eye following an accident in which he lost his right hand only to have it replaced by an artificial one gwilym suffered from an acute lack of charisma and looked like one of the bad guys while mick ford who played the irritating chico barnes made me think of a horse's arse whenever he was on screen for six weeks this less than dynamic duo charged about the countryside foiling nefarious plots to fix races usually by the same methods blackmail kidnapping riders or doping horses yorkshire television threw money at the show but to no avail violent sexist far fetched and repetitious it was quickly carted off to the knackers yard
this is really terrible br br the only redeeming feature about this movie is that the next time people ask me what is the worst vampire movie i have ever watched i would have a suitable reply br br i think it is filmed on 35 mm so it is already tacky like hell i wouldn't have bothered commenting but i noticed some fanboys probably connected to the movie had claimed that this was the best movie since the matrix let me debunk the myths and lies br br there is nothing good in the movie everything yells tacky the actress is ugly the fight choreography is the worst i have ever seen the fight scenes are unbelievably amateurish imagine a girl flailing her arms around in a circle helplessly and delivering weak kicks which wouldn't hurt a kitten obviously the director just pulled people off the street to give them roles in the movie br br i know the director did not have much budget for the movie but still better movies have been made on smaller budget before unforgivable
much in the same way frank miller and his sin city comics used black and white to express itself and its film noir influences so does christian volckman with renaissance br br it is the year 2054 in paris in the tradition of science fiction the future is a bright sparkling multi teared jewel this is a jewel in a setting of misery inequity and darkness bright and beautiful on top with a dark underbelly beneath one of these bright people at the top a research scientist from a very large and influential global company avalon is kidnapped the well known and efficient captain karas voiced by the new james bond himself daniel craig is assigned the task to find her br br the plot and layout is not overly original it is heavily influenced by film noir gibson's neuromancer and other detective stories along with movies like blade runner sin city fritz lang's metropolis and minority report there is the main plot surrounded by other possible sub plots that all connect at the end it is not hard to figure it all out br br the movie's strength and originality is in its intense visual presentation paris is an intricate array of levels and sub levels at its base is the more primitive industrial infrastructure as the city rises so does its architectural complexity and luminescence yet in this structure the top does not equate with elevation of human ideals and behavior paris has been intricately animated and laid out in brilliant black and white the movie is closer in spirit with sin city the comics then sin city the movie was with its source material this is done all the more easy because it is still remaining in relatively the same medium animation much in the same way as a scanner darkly pushed the visual aspects of story telling so does this the light and dark black and white creates an atmosphere of contrasts as well as visual ambiguity right and wrong black and white can lose all meaning at the same time it is right in front of us the movie proves how black and white can be both ambiguous and obvious at the same time br br in keeping with the spirit of the movie i can be both critic and fan i can love and loath in the same light it is definitely an experience i recommend for lovers of the visual arts so pour another black and tan enter the void and enjoy the ride
in the recent movement to bring asian films over to america this is the last movie that should be released here being a big fan of asian movies from all genres i was browsing the net and came across this soong to be re released into the us market so i decided to check it out ahead of time and rent this at a local video store br br trust me the action scenes are incredibly disappointing crouching tiger and iron monkey completely blew this movie out of the water jet li would fall asleep watching the fighting sequences if you're looking for martial arts entertainment your time would be better off with a jackie chan flick br br moreover you think you're going to watch a martial arts with about a girl engulfed in vengence for her parents death but surprise a good hour of this movie in the middle has is filled with dialogue an absense of action the lack of devloping a tangent plot pretty much nothing to do with the premise we are exposed to it has more to do with the relationship between her and the boy and the boy with his conspiracy group in which the producer director dedicated no time in elbaorating and yet dedicated a portion of the film dragging the issue would of been much better off if they had just cut that whole hour and developed the story in itself through another film and focus on the martial arts aspect br br speaking of which i really don't believe the choreographer of iron monkey did the action sequence in princess blade i was completely insulted in the frequent usage of slow motion and quick camera changes to portray the assassins physical swiftness i just didn't buy it br br please i'm warning you to please do not waste your time money with this movie the premise is intrigueing and the trailer might even tempt you but i am positive that this movie is not suited for the public maybe in japan but not in the states and will be the worst film brought over to the states from the asian film industry

some films that you pick up for a pound turn out to be rather good 23rd century films released dozens of obscure italian and american movie that were great but although hardgore released some fulci films amongst others the bulk of their output is crap like the zombie chronicles br br the only positive thing i can say about this film is that it's nowhere near as annoying as the stink of flesh other than that its a very clumsy anthology film with the technical competence of a lego house built by a whelk br br it's been noted elsewhere but you really do have to worry about a film that inserts previews of the action into its credit sequence so by the time it gets to the zombie attacks you've seen it all already br br bad movie fans will have a ball watching the 18 000 continuity mistakes and the diabolical acting of the cast especially the hitchhiker who was so bad he did make me laugh a bit and kudos to hardgore for getting in to the spirit of things by releasing a print so bad it felt like i was watching some beat up home video of a camping trip br br awful awful stuff we've all made stuff like this when we've gotten a hold of a camera but common sense prevails and these films languish in our cupboards somewhere avoid
much of over her dead body is so painfully unfunny that i was actually squirming in my seat out of embarrassment for the actors br br eva longoria proves that she can't carry a film in this terrible romantic comedy and further that she doesn't really even have any comedic timing she's grating and annoying as a ghost who returns to earth to keep a cooky psychic from dating her widower fiancé the fiancé is played by paul rudd drippy and charmless while the psychic is played by lake bell bringing the movie whatever anemic energy it has i felt most sorry for bell as she appears to have some comic abilities and was working overtime in an effort to make the material work unfortunately she is up against the insurmountable task of making any movie that features jason biggs tolerable and she is dragged down with the rest of the cast like leo dicaprio at the end of titanic br br over her dead body actually pi ed me off because of its laziness and utter lack of effort i started to think of all the interesting projects that can't get funded because vast amounts of money are being funneled into bland crap like this seriously does hollywood think movies like this are good enough how stupid do they really think the movie going public is br br grade f
this series could very well be the best britcom ever and that is saying a great deal considering the competitors fawlty towers good neighbours to name just two br br what made butterflies so superior even to the best of the best is that it did not just exemplify great classic classy and intelligent comedy but it also expanded horizons reflecting flawlessly gently and at every detail the great social change that was occurring in britain at the time br br i remember watching this show as a teenager and being in awe of everything about it the lifestyle depicted was remarkable in itself this was the first time i saw real people using cordless phones and the wardrobe of all the characters was far removed from the goofy seventies attire still seen in north america at the time then there were the decors shop fronts cars these people even the layabout sons with their philosophical approach to life and epigrammatic humor were sophisticated they were examples of the new europeans that would come to have an impact on life and style throughout the world in the coming decade 1980s br br of course the premise was strange and fantastic the idea that someone who was living the suburban dream could be so discontent and restless was revolutionary particularly to north americans for whom happiness was always defined as money and things sure the situation was depicted in american movies and tv but not with the intensity of butterflies or the movie montenegro and if the premise was not surprising enough the means by which it was expressed took it to the extreme a potential affair that was not really about sex or even romance butterflies dazzled many but it must have left some people smacking their foreheads in disbelief at the time anyway br br butterflies turned out to be in so many ways prophetic it documented ahead of its time post modern ennui all pervasive lifestyle the notion of emotional infidelity and generational disconnect and male discontent portrayed perfectly by the strained father son relationships it is too bad this series has not been rediscovered in a big way and all those involved given credit for creating a meaningful snapshot of a certain time and place and foreseeing all the slickness and angst that was to come

yesterday my spanish catalan wife and myself saw this emotional lesson in history spain is going into the direction of political confrontation again that is why this masterpiece should be shown in all spanish high schools it is a tremendous lesson in the hidden criminality of fascism the american pilot who gets involved in the spanish civil war chooses for the democratically elected republican government the criminal role of religion is surprisingly well shown in one of the most inventive scenes that uribe ever made the colors are magnificent the cruelty of a war could anybody tell me the difference between any war and a civil war is used as a scenario of hope when two young children express their feelings and protect each other the cowards that start their abuse of power even towards innocent children are now active again a film like 'el viaje de carol' 'carol's journey' tells one of the so many sad stories of the 20th century it is a better lesson in history than any book could contain again great work from the peninsula iberica
in iran women are not admitted to soccer games officially it's because they are to be spared from the vulgar language and behavior of the male audience but of course it is about sexism women are lower forms of human beings br br some brave girls oppose this and try to get into the stadium by using different tricks they are caught by soldiers and hold in a kind of cage until the police will come and pick them up br br despite the insane situation this is a film with lots of humor it's also encouraging to see how people always find different ways of fighting oppression you'll get touched at the same time as you have lots of laughs good job by director jafar panahi this is in many ways a heroic comedy
i've seen this film criticized with the statement if you can get past the moralizing that misses the point moralizing is in the conscience of the beholder as it were this is a decent film with a standard murder mystery but with a distinct twist that surfaces midway through the resolution leaves the viewer wondering what would i have done in this position and i have to believe that's exactly what the filmmaker intended to that end and to the end of entertaining the audience the film succeeds i also like the way that the violence is never on stage but just off camera we know what has just happened it's just not served up in front of us then rubbed in our faces as it would be today with contemporary blood and gore dressing besides the violence is not the point the point is the protagonist's moral dilemma which is cleverly albeit disturbingly resolved
this is a film for entertainment i did not think the world made social commentary from one small film i personally find this film funny audacious and memorable it is a fantasy not unlike a cinder girl becoming a princess this film was done very well i might add in the 70's a time of the best experiments in film with being able to mention a person's sexuality this movie is not about a person being homosexual or not it is however about love in all it's strange forms this film does show some of the realities of being gay in the 70's in hollywood or in california pretty boys being looked after by older not so pretty men women who had to stay deeply locked in the emotional closet or risk not having a career bathhouses were an integral part of the gay community br br then the fantasy begins let us mix a lesbian with a gay and add some liquor and what do we have well this movie which in any way was better than that dismal redo the next big thing perhaps someone should have asked the entire crew to see this movie and then try to do better br br i enjoyed this movie when i saw it in the 70's and it still brings a smile to my lips now i heartily advise anyone who wants a funny tender movie to curl up with some popcorn and have some fun some people need to lighten up and this is the film you should do it with br br
simply one of the best ever richard brooks' adaptation of truman capote's non fiction novel is truly an artistic achievement stunning black and white cinematography that should have won an oscar a haunting quincy jones score and tremendous performances by robert blake and scott wilson as the oddly matched killers this film was 0 for 4 at the academy awards and wasn't even nominated for best picture while dr doolittle was go figure br br although you don't get to know the clutter family as well as you do in the book it was a good decision to focus more on perry and dick and the pain staking process of tracking these guys down john forsythe is also impressive as alvin dewey there are simply no flaws in this one 10 out of 10 best performance scott wilson with r blake a close second highly recommended
i have never watched a movie in so little time the only salvation was the fast forward function on the dvd unit it was like watching a poorly produced cbc film there was obviously no money for lighting filming sets location scriptwriters editors actors oh there was absolutely no story either i need to write ten lines of comment bad awful horrible wretched anguishing tortuous bilious nauseous sickening fromage disgusting flimsy icky yucky pukey stinky smelly vile putrid all thumbs down and i don't know if i can keep on going to complete all ten lines of just how bad this piece of crap o matic production was
this film so not funny such a waste of great stars who seem to be caught up so in their own stardom that they forget only shining moments belong to john cleese as the hotel manager who likes to dress up you almost fall out of your chair with helpless laughter when he dances to donna summer's bad girls while wearing high heels a mink coat and a dainty hat the rest forget it
there is no doubt that during the decade of the 30s the names of boris karloff and bela lugosi became a sure guarantee of excellent performances in high quality horror films after being universal's first monster in the seminal classic dracula bela lugosi became the quintessential horror villain thanks to his elegant style and his foreign accent sadly this last factor would also led him to be type casted during the 40s in the same way boris karloff's performance in james whale's frankenstein transformed him into the man to look for when one wanted a good monster of course it was only natural for these icons to end up sharing the screen and the movie that united them was 1934's the black cat this formula would be repeated in several films through the decade and director lambert hillyer's mix of horror and science fiction the invisible ray is another of those minor classics they did in those years br br in the invisible ray dr janos rukh boris karloff is a brilliant scientist who has invented a device able to show scenes of our planet's past captured in rays of light coming from the galaxy of andromeda while showing his invention to his colleagues dr felix benet bela lugosi and sir francis stevens walter kingsford they discover that thousands of years ago a meteor hit in what is now nigeria after this marvelous discovery dr rukh decides to join his colleagues in an expedition to africa looking for the landing place of the mysterious meteor this expedition won't be any beneficial for rukh as during the expedition his wife diane frances drake will fall in love with ronald drake frank lawton an expert hunter brought by the stevens to aid them in their expedition however rukh will lose more than his wife in that trip as he'll be forever changed after being exposed to the invisible ray of the meteor br br written by john colton who previously did the script for werewolf of london the invisible ray had its roots on an original sci fi story by howard higgin and douglas hodges given that this was a movie with karloff and lugosi colton puts a lot of emphasis on the horror side of his story playing in a very effective way with the mad scientist archetype and adding a good dose of melodrama to spice things up one element that makes the invisible ray to stand out among other horror films of that era is the way that colton plays with morality through the story that is there aren't exactly heroes and villains in the classic style but people who make decisions and later face the consequences of those choices in many ways the invisible ray is a modern tragedy about obsessions guilt and revenge br br a seasoned director of low budget b movies filmmaker lambert hillyer got the chance to make 3 films for universal pictures when the legendary studio was facing serious financial troubles thanks to his experience working with limited resources hillyer's films were always very good looking despite the budgetary constrains and the invisible ray was not an exception while nowhere near the stylish gothic atmosphere of previous universal horror films hillyer's movie effectively captures the essence of colton's script as he gives this movie a dark and morbid mood more in tone with pulp novels than with straightforward sci fi finally a word must be said about hillyer's use of special effects for an extremely low budget film they look a lot better than the ones in several a movies of the era br br as usual in a movie with lugosi and karloff the performances by this legends are of an extraordinary quality as the film's protagonist boris karloff is simply perfect in his portrayal of a man so blinded by the devotion to his work that fails to see the evil he unleashes as his colleague dr benet bela luogis is simply a joy to watch stealing every scene he is in and showing what an underrated actor he was as rukh's wife frances drake is extremely effective truly helping her character to become more than a damsel in distress still two of the movie highlights are the performances of kemble cooper as mother rukh and beulah bondi as lady arabella as the two actresses make the most of their limited screen time making unforgettable their supporting roles frank lawton is also good in his role but nothing surprising when compared to the rest of the cast br br if one judges this movie under today's standards it's very easy to dismiss it as another cheap science fiction film with bad special effects and carelessly jumbled pseudoscience however that would be a mistake as despite its low budget it is remarkably well done for its time on the top of that considering that the movie was made when the nuclear era was about to begin and radioactivity was still a relatively new concept it's ideas about the dangers of radioactivity are frighteningly accurate one final thing worthy to point out is the interesting way the script handles the relationships between characters specially the friendship and rivalry that exists between the obsessive dr rukh and the cold dr benet as this allows great scenes between the two iconic actors br br while nowhere near the gothic expressionism of the frankenstein movies nor

salva and his pal bigardo have been at the margin of the law during most of their lives we see them panhandling in a car of the underground where their pitch to get donations is so lame no one gives them anything salva who is a hardened petty criminal doesn't even have any redeeming qualities that is until he discovers a reality show on television that gives him the idea of what to do next religion and show business prove to be a winning combination something that salva capitalizes on br br he and bigardo have been in jail after the accidental death of a priest that was critical of the duo salva shows he is a natural for the reality show he transforms himself into a christ like figure who is an instant success in the program espe who is a no nonsense woman who is show's producer can't escape from the way salva pays her unusual attention ultimately salva is the victim of his own success in the end br br jordi molla whose first directorial job this movie is had some success in the way the film satirizes the role of television spain which was vulnerable to these types of programs has seen its share of the bizarre which is what the director felt is an assault on the viewing public and wanted to set his story from the point of view of the people that are making a fortune out of the naive audience br br the ensemble cast has some good moments in the film mr molla like any actor who decides to direct his first feature would have been more effective concentrating on the picture in front of the camera candela pena a good actress is one of the best reasons for watching the movie juan carlos villedo david gimenez cacho franco francescoantonio florinda chico and the rest responded well to the new director
waqt is a perfect example of a chicken soup not exactly for your soul the broth unfortunately has lost its actual taste thanks to all the excess dilution and garnishing that went into its making br br what's surprising and disappointing about waqt is that it comes from a director who stayed away from the usual clichés of hindi cinema in his first venture but who in his second outing gives in for all the stereotype film formulas while vipul shah had the conviction to show something as implausible as blind men robbing a bank in aankhen he just fails to induce life in the entire packaging of waqt that is based on something as conceivable as a father son relationship adopted from a gujarati play aavjo vhala fari malishu waqt does have a sensible storyline with a social message to back up a mature look on the father son relationship a father's unconditional love towards his son and a son's responsibility towards his family ishwar chand sharawat amitabh bachchan who has established his entire empire on his own from the scratch leads an affluent life with his wife sumitra shefali shah their only son aditya akshay kumar never had the need to strive for anything since he got everything tailor made and spoon fed in life ishwar's pampering has only spoil him all the more br br aditya dreams to turning into a superstar but does nothing to make his dreams come true in the meanwhile he marries his ladylove mitali priyanka chopra ishwar hopes that marriage will make aditya a more responsible man but he is disappointed aditya is still at his blithe best leading a carefree life br br the endurance limit finally collapses when ishwar expels aditya from his house the sudden change in the attitude of his affectionate father towards him and his now expecting wife baffles aditya he has no option left but to strive for the livelihood of his wife and his unborn kid he starts turning into an independent man but the rift in the relationship between him and his father grows br br the story is simplistic while the uncomplicated screenplay has a very elementary approach one can easily identify and relate with the credible characters of both the father and the son if you are not one of the two you at least might have come across individuals like them somewhere in real life br br add to it director vipul shah's easy handling of the screenplay with a family affair like this any other director in his place would have added in tons of melodrama in the proceedings as per the cinematic laws of bollywood family dramas turning the film into a compulsive tearjerker however shah excels in the effortless handling of emotions for most part of the film br br clear cut example of his unpretentious direction is palpable in the pre interval scene where the father expels the son from his house in a rather frivolous manner the purpose of the scene is achieved without blotting a brunt on the audiences' brains ditto for the scene in the second half wherein the now separated father son have a flippant conversation that's what differentiates waqt from a kabhi kushi ghum or an ek rishtaa and in fact places it one level high in terms of treatment br br but after gaining all the distinction points one may wonder where does waqt still fail in the problem lies in the fact that while waqt distinguishes itself from the others in it's league in terms of treatment it gives in to the glitches in the terms of packaging what with the director forcing in song n dance every now and then in the first half there's a johar kinda shaadi song a chopra kinda holi song a father son disco dandia song a dream song and a dream come true song inducing sufficient yawns in the viewer picture this the father has just ousted the son from his house and the son is dreaming of a song in moroccan mountains with his wife out of place out of reason and the audience out of seat br br the film just drags in the first half and the actual story starts only in the second half the director has wasted too much waqt on unnecessary elements the much talked about dog chase sequence isn't bad but is not redeeming either however akshay kumar's taandav dance is simply ridiculous imagine he qualifies for the star hunt in the movie with this unintentionally hilarious histrionic add to it the climax set at the finals of the star hunt where the son bursts out with emotions that's so archetypal also the editing pattern could have been reversed to conceal the father's reason for the change in attitude towards his son br br anu malik's music is fine though unnecessary in the proceedings santosh thundiiayil's camera work is competent enough though not much demanding aatish kapadia has come up with some good dialogs for dramatic moments br br boman irani and rajpal yadav make up or the light moments in the film very efficiently while rajpal yadav has been going overboard with his comic histrionics in many films off lately this time he underplays his character and is completely restrained his deadpan expressions are perfectly complimented with boman's over the top histrionics br br shefali shah is convincing in the mother's role not to be taken as a censure but she is flawless in both playing and 'looking' her character priyanka is gorgeous and performs her part well br br of course the major applause deserves are akshay kumar and amitabh bachchan akshay is especially expressive in the scene where his doting father intentionally berates him to make him aware of his responsibilities though bachchan goes a bit dramatic in a couple of scenes his brilliance strikes throughout the film br br to sum up waqt is like a soup whose ingredients are both tasty and nutritional but the final recipe somehow isn't as much appetizing
i love this movie it is one of those movies that you can watch time and time again and still find engaging congratulations i believe everyone involved in making the movie and the script should be proud of themselves it is so eerie you feel like you are watching a real life band i would like to see more movies like this i am glad that they did not choose famous hollywood stars to be in this movie because it probably would not have worked and even if billy connolly is quite well known he really got stuck into the role and i could not imagine anybody else playing it congratulations again i really believe this movie deserves the peter sellers comedy award for bill nighy and when you get to the final scene well what can i say
the special effects of this movie are especially for its time laughable and used in such an over emphasized way that you can't deny their terrible existance br br the acting redefines the term terrible overacting at the hands of meg foster and richard joseph paul where julie newman and andrew divoff just redefine bad br br spoilers br br the charm in this movie can be found in two things first is the excellent casting of carel lurch struycken as the mysterious psychic gaunt who can sense where and when people will die and is always there br br the second are original finds the combination sf western is obviously original if terrible but other finds are more original like the gunman zack stone being able to sense the pain of the people he shoots though his acting falls short here br br overal don't see this movie except if you love that ol' hunk o brutal carel struycken as any self respecting dutchman should
wow could have been such a good movie starts of with brittany daniels tied up im thinking cool we are going to get a flash back but nothing movie starts anew with the kid filming this movie probably would have been better if it wasn't for the acting i mean the acting was mostly horrible although with the lines the poor actors had to deal with i guess they did the best they could still it really ruin the movie for me the twins were the only ones that seem to have some acting skills the movie drags to long for the supposed shocking conclusion all in all i have seen worse low budget movies but considering this was hype with the 8 films to die for i was very disappointed by the way were did some reviewers say there was gore and stuff did i see the same movie well this is 4 out of the eight and so far only one has been any good
this abc straight to tv failure does absolutely no justice to the brilliant fantasy novel that is a wrinkle in time ms madeleine l'engle brought children and adults alike into a magical fantastical and original world like no author before her this novel the first in her 'time quartet' is a beautiful take on life the universe and time itself yet it is easy for any child or adolescent to understand its unwavering morals are prevalent throughout the book this film adaptation can be seen as nothing but a mockery of ms l'engle's work of art honestly what were they thinking the effects look cheap and ridiculous the plot is mushy and uneven the dialogue is far fetched and just about every magical characteristic of the novel has been lost this was a horrible attempt at bringing this book to the screen i sincerely hope that someday an intelligent worthy director guillermo del toro david yates alfonso cuarón makes another attempt at bringing this book to the screen and understands it for what it truly is a masterpiece this adaptation can only be compared to boring fake and cheap motel room art which holds no ground and makes absolutely no impact on its audience
when a small hobbit named frodo baggins inherits a magic ring from his uncle the wizard gandalf investigates and discovers that the ring is an ancient creation of an evil dark lord should the ring end up back in his hands he will regain his power and destroy middle earth frodo and his loyal friends set out on a a quest to destroy the ring with a band of warriors this is an underrated adaption of the classic novels as it only covers the first half of the story regardless this is an epic and wonderfully animated film br br the animation is superbly done with rotoscope which is tracing over live action footage ralph bakshi worked well with the low budget he was given the film also boasts a grand music score by leonard rosenman that fits every scene there are a few plot holes with the script but that has to be excused considering the original deal was to make the book trilogy into two films much had to crammed in the first one my biggest gripe is some of the character design samwise was a bit too goofy while the other hobbits act completely normal the other characters are actually well written for the screen and the voice actors do a great job i was pleased that legolas is actually a bit more helpful to the plot the rotoscoped orcs are more comical than frightening while the ringwraiths are eerie and nightmarish br br another problem is that the evil wizard saruman is called aruman thanks to the writers overall i think a little more money and better writers would have done this a lot of justice but there is something charming about it ralph bakshi made a valiant effort of making screen adaption of these classic stories the film suffers terribly from being overshadowed by the live action films but it's still a great movie for animation lovers of all ages
before there was crash there was this interesting film called grand canyon released about 14 years sooner than the former film grand canyon was a movie about two people from different backgrounds who come together as friends over a lifetime to me crash was still a slightly better film but grand canyon was no slouch either br br taking place in los angeles an upper class lawyer named mack kevin kline takes a shortcut through the seedier side of town only to have his car break down at the worst time he calls for a tow truck and has to wait for awhile only to soon be threatened by a group of dangerous people who want his car soon the tow truck driver arrives at the perfect moment and out steps simon danny glover to take the truck away both men are threatened but simon manages to get himself mack and the car out of dire straits it is from here on out that a friendship develops between the two men over a lifetime with mack helping out simon just as simon had helped him out of a dangerous situation earlier you see simon's sister deborah tina lifford is living in a dangerous neighborhood with her two children and fears for her oldest son who seems to be roaming the streets at night with some bad people mack offers them a better place to live as well as hooking simon up with his secretary's friend jane alfre woodard br br this is the main plot of the film but there are other smaller plots involving the same secretary mentioned above mary louise parker as well as mack's wife mary mcdonnel who discovers an abandoned baby not long after their son roberto jeremy sisto in his first movie role has gone to camp for the summer and will likely be moving on with his own life soon the details of all these plots are brought together into one complex movie which uses a police helicopter as a metaphor for life and as a bridge to entwine all the different scenes this simple plot device works very well and helps greatly with the flow of the story br br the director lawrence kasdan whose biggest movie to this date was the big chill has created a splendid movie here the cast is excellent and most of the ideas are well thought out but alas it falls short of greatness because some points that would've made the film even stronger are glossed over the story involving the secretary is one and the second involving simon's nephew is the other these scenes should've been more apart of the entire story and then maybe lawrence kasdan's views of life between the upper and lower classes would've been more on a superior level instead of just very good still grand canyon exceeded expectations and yes you will get to see a view of the canyon that this movie was named after there is also a small role for steve martin as davis a producer of violent films who offers his own views on life and has a small part to play in this movie's ideas
after being a big fan of the ten minute t v episodes of 'stella street' i awaited this film with excitement and anticipation unfortunately i was left feeling very disappointed br br i was dismayed by the way that nearly all of the gags and one liners were directly lifted from the t v episodes and delivered with much less enthusiasm and comic timing as if the actors had said them once and couldn't be bothered to say them again i bought my copy on dvd and felt cheated that i had parted with my hard earned cash to watch the same jokes over again br br spoilers the plot of the film starts with stella street a normal english street in surrey gradually being populated by 'some of the most famous people from stage and screen of the last forty years' including michael caine al pacino jack nicholson and the rolling stones all the celebrities in the street end up being conned out of their entire fortunes by a local fraudster and are forced to live like tramps and common working class people there are some nice moments but on the whole the writers manage to take an interesting idea and make it pretty boring end of spoilers br br in the t v episodes all the characters are performed by john sessions and phil cornwell including females but in the film ronni ancona is added to the cast i think this was a mistake her impersonations weren't funny and it felt like her characters were included in the story just to give her something to do br br if you were not a fan of the episodes of stella street you may find this film entertaining but if you were a fan i think you may walk away feeling a little bit cheated 4 10
this is comedy as it once was and comparing this with the two remakes the money pit and are we done yet only points out all the more how the 40's movie makers had a flair for comedy which has since regretfully been lost br br i was 15 when i first saw this and even at that tender age there was much i could laugh at now of course being familiar with adult frustrations i see a whole lot that i missed as a youth br br the three main actors cary grant myrna loy and melvyn douglas interacted perfectly but the core of the movie lies in the frustrations encountered in achieving a dream it's never as easy and free of unseen complications as one envisions br br all in all this is a classic comedy which still stands above the attempts to remake it
just saw a pre screening tonight what can i say it lived up to it's mediocre trailer run though that's saying nothing at all it did absolutely nothing that any movie before it hasn't done and it played out in such a cliché fashion that eventually i got to the point where i stopped laughing only because i was laughing with the audience and instead let the humorless movie play out br br so let's see we have the less than spectacular main character that is trying to get back with his ex girlfriend but he's not good enough for her check we have the three buddies that all have their own personality with one being the best friend who tries to get with the main girl character's best friend but is constantly rejected another friend being the super awkward one that can't live down seeing the positive in everything 24 7 and is thrown in for the one liners which in this case is just a bunch of movie references specifically from disney and the third guy whose name you won't ever remember but is there to complete the square and throw in consoling messages to whomever will care to listen check we have the girl's ex boyfriend and her parents block the relationship at any possible means when things are looking up not to mention the awkward family members from the main character's side check we have the downer period an hour into the movie where everyone is depressed check we have the movie's funny moments come from incessant swearing people falling down or being hit scenes from the trailer and homosexual innuendos check and dare i call it a spoiler but we have an ending that unfolds exactly as one thought that it would unfold before even seeing the movie check br br honestly this could have no wait should have been a pg 13 movie all that needed to be dropped were any f bombs honestly it would have gotten much more publicity from the crowd that enjoys this kind of humor would have gotten less media exposure and thusly would have not been disliked as much from people like myself who should try and hold it up higher to the recent r rated comedies like superbad and knocked up the humor in this movie is just so awkward that it doesn't fit in with what general people look for i bet even the actors were often times unsettled with some of the dialogue and action they had to deliver on camera let's put it this way in the theater it will help you laugh because it's on the big screen and others are laughing when this movie hits showtime and you're checking it out at 2 00 pm on an off day you may be inclined to change the channel the only thing that will keep you watching is alice eve's hotness who is not quite a 10 but still very good looking br br aside from the main resolution this film kicked a lot of subplots to the side of the curb and seemed to forget to write more story that they tried to develop in the beginning of the movie where everything else pretty much flies out the window so there is a main resolution but what comes of it it's never really clear cut nor does it allow the ending to be feel good with the abruptness br br there was only one thing worth nothing in this movie and that was the good soundtrack aside from the nice choice of 90's alternative rock songs there was a nice upbeat score that would play in some parts of the movie more so the beginning of it that reminds me of something david holmes would mix up compose i'll give them props for a great choice of sound br br one last thing this movie was probably filmed sometime late last summer because the inadvertent yet proud pepsi sponsorship showed the yellow bottle caps that they had during that rock band promotion i just figured a lot of rock band gamers would catch onto that one if you saw it but i say hold onto your money if this was pg 13 and you were 15 years old on a friday night with a group of friends i'd say knock yourselves out otherwise definitely pass it doesn't try and compete with the r rated movies of the past few years and ideally it definitely isn't as good
if you appreciate the renaissance in asian horror don't bother with gawi the film scarcely deserves mention alongside a list work such as ringu a tale of two sisters cure and ju on or even such good material as the eye or inner senses those films brim with subtleties unexpected imagery rich characters and a decidedly non western take on what's frightening gawi is strung together with the leftover limbs and organs of everything that has made american horror lousy for the past twenty five years br br the film tries to blend asian ghost story and hollywood slasher flick but it's a bad fit one aesthetic is bound to smother the other guess which having no story of their own to tell the filmmakers loot ringu for an evil child subplot but the situation is hopeless clichés crap characters witless plotting a dull ghost ho hum
i once used wesley snipes' name as a clue to go ahead and watch a new untried film in which he appears so now for the first time my snipes method of film recommendation has failed utterly i should first have come here to see these reviews br br snipes ought to be ashamed to allow his otherwise earnest efforts to be so wasted in the contractor br br one of my worst flick fears has come to bitter fruition i feared that the shaky blurry pseudo documentary unconsidered directing and editing style first brought to my attention by the paul greengrass directed bloody sunday might propagate to other films greengass' sickening style was then brought to nauseatingly new heights in the last two of the bourne trilogy films my fear had come to pass in my opinion these films are made really bad by these motion sickness inducing methods which mistake blurry swipes for action enhancement but the bourne franchise as greengrass so loving calls his cash cow apparently convinced others in hollywood to go unprofessional in the quest for fast big bucks br br read my lips you hollywood types action needs to be clearly photographed and presented not merely hinted at by poor lazy cinematographic techniques br br and the contractor goes so far as to emulate the bourne ultimatum in inanely repeated sound bites in hopes their juvenile apparently evaluated audiences can't sense them for example if i hear a cop radio crackling yankee romeo one more time i'll just scream the chances are good i won't hear it again i certainly won't ever view the contractor again br br i recommend to those of you who have yet to see the contractor just be content with the tranquility this lack affords to your life br br 2 out of 10 i am tempted to lower that to a 1
this movie was a major disappointment on direction intellectual niveau plot and in the way it dealt with its subject painting it is a slow moving film set like an episode of wonder years with appalling lack of depth though it also fails to deliver its message in a convincing manner br br the approach to the subject of painting is very elite limited to vague and subjective terms as beauty according to the makers of this movie 'beauty' can be only experienced in bob ross style kitschy landscape paintings good art according to this film can be achieved by applying basic like primary school level color theory and lots of sentiment in parts the movie is offending e g at a point it is stated rather celebrated by dancing on tables that mentally handicapped people are not capable of having emotions or expressing them through painting their works by definition being worthless 'bullshit' quote br br i do not understand how the movie could get such high rating then again so far not many people rated it and they chose for only very high or very low grades
the plot is rocky the acting is somewhere south of a jr high school play the cinematography is not bad but it looks like it was cut with a machete i couldn't decide of this was an intentionally hokey flick or if the people behind it actually thought they were making a good film think death valley days meets mayberry rfd people running around in a 'lawless' modern town wearing quick draw 6 gun rigs it has more than its fair share of 'cutsey' stuff picture the good guys pulling up to an old farm house and parking the ford mustang right in front of a hitching rail picture the clerk in a hotel watching an obviously western hemisphere movie sporting a japanese sound track but with english sub titles it's all really strange but might be improved if watching it while partaking in a little peyote it's a real curiosity with modern parallels to every western movie cliché you can think of there's even a modern version of the good hearted dance hall girl and a twanging jew's harp in the soundtrack really if someone brings this to your home for a saturday night movie session tell 'em your dvd player died
time paradoxes are the devil's snare for underemployed minds they're fun to consider in a 'what if ' sort of way film makers and authors have dealt with this time and again in a host of films and television including 'star trek first contact' the 'back to the future' trilogy 'bill and ted's excellent adventure' 'groundhog day' and the stargate sg1 homage 'window of opportunity' heinlein's 'all you zombies' was written decades ago and yet it will still spin out people reading that short story for the first time br br in the case of terry gilliam's excellent film '12 monkeys' it's hard to establish what may be continuity problems versus plot elements intended to make us re think our conception of the film repeated viewings will drive us to different conclusions if we retain an open mind br br some seeing the film for the first time will regard cole played by bruce willis as a schizophrenic most will see cole as a man disturbed by what adams describes as 'the continual wrenching of experience' visited upon him by time travel br br unlike other time travel stories '12 monkeys' is unclear as to whether future history can be changed by manipulating events in the past cole tells his psychiatrist railly madeleine stowe that time cannot be changed but a phone call he makes from the airport is intercepted by scientists after he has been sent back to 1996 in his own personal time line br br even this could be construed as an event that had to happen in a single time line universe in order to ensure that the time line is not altered cole has to die before the eyes of his younger self for fate to be realized if that's the case time is like a fluid it always finds its own level or path irrespective of the external forces working on it it boggles the mind to dwell on this sort of thing too much br br if you can change future events that then guide the actions of those with the power to send people back in time as we see on board the plane at the end of the film then that means the future can be changed by manipulating past events or does it the film has probably led to plenty of drunken brawls at bars frequented by physicists and mathematicians
having just wasted a couple of hours watching this and for 80 of that time in complete disbelief i can give this garbage the turkey of the year award no problem to say the plot was unbelievable is some big understatement frankly i am lost for words to describe this utter tripe not only are the characters completely and utterly without any semblance of originality this sort of stuff has been done much better in dozens of 'serial killer flicks' but the acting was dire for those who pay to see this i hope you get your money back for those who were paid to do this i hope you give your money back believe me folks there are many new releases out there that are much much better go see
i enjoyed this film it was lighthearted delightful and very colorful you can see that mgm was showing off technicolor there are hardly any colors that do not appear in this film every scene is packed full the choreography was great gene kelly is a wonder he is so talented the dance numbers in this film are all perfectly executed and perfectly designed he understands that the dances can tell the story as much as anything else the last section of the film the grand dance sequence is very impressive what makes this film very special is gershwin's music few american composers have had a better gift for melody i very much enjoy gershwin's music it is enchanting ira gershwin is definitely one of the greatest lyric writers he is so witty and charming this was a highly entertaining film
as with most of the reviewers i saw this on starz ondemand after watching the preview with my girlfriend she decided not to watch it from how bad the preview watched i on the other hand thought it looked weird enough to warrant a watching i mean the design of dr meso alone warranted at least a brief sweep over this title after watching it i can say that while there are some interesting aspects to it namely the browsing over the notebooks and trying to figure out the incomprehensible story it's best to pass over this one br br major spoilers ahead after making their first video for their as yet unfinished cd the lead singer cassidy kills herself in an attempt to get her boyfriend neil to notice her 3 months later the band is trying to decide if they're going to finish the album or not to try and see what cassidy would have wanted they go to see an old psychic friend of hers dr meso and try to contact her through him in his card reading dr meso turns up four straight death cards for the four remaining band members bad times are ahead i just wanted to make a point that later in the film they do explain that the death card really just represents change kudos to them on that at least even without the approval of their deceased friend they decide to go ahead and finish the album but while in the bathroom cassidy's best friend dora catches a glimpse of her deceased friend when another band mate goes in to check on her dora is standing in the dark requesting his sunglasses that's when the killing begins br br my main problem with the film from the very get go is that it seems to be heavy stylized to a fault too many warping effects unnecessary zooms and a plethora of other cheap effects riddle this film an incoherent storyline doesn't help anything either while the narrative hangs together for the first part once cassidy is resurrected everything falls apart we have jump cuts between cassidy and dr meso who mysteriously was able to get into a locked building which show they are connected in some way or another however within a few minutes of that revelation we find that cassidy really is an independent being from meso she then turns on the guy who had been helping her revenge and he scurries away in a way that calls to mind jack nicholson as the joker but not in a good way br br from this point on the whereabouts of cassidy are shown but there are strange lapses as character moves from place to place almost out of sequence one scene we see cassidy standing at a desk when a character enters in the next she's nowhere to be found as he moves behind the desk we see her at the end of a hallway then in another room grabbing the keys which neil already has then back again not to mention that from one moment to the next cassidy's mood seems to go a complete 180 without a catalyst to it one moment she wants to kill everyone although she's only wounded 90 of the characters the next she's apologizing to everyone and walks out the door to die again sound confusing that's because it is it's a jumbled mess that i'm sure the writer couldn't even figure out br br as for the performances most are particularly wooden some though are interesting but overall this isn't a piece that would be known for it's acting the story is the driving force behind this piece
seriously avoid this movie at any cost i just saw it in my first sneak preview ever and although i paid non refundable money for it i walked out of the cinema after a mere 15 minutes which already includes 2 minutes of discussion among my friends whether or not to leave first time ever i walked out of a movie and i lived through some pretty bad ones br br it's one of those films that is dubbed and badly so even though it is shown in its original language it relies on the oldest simplest and cheapest jokes in the book on the military what do we do once we reach the fighting zone you get out of the car and die actually it's much funnier to read here that the way it was delivered in the film on drugs a guy eats some space cookies behaves really silly and misses his wedding or has to live through it while high all badly written and acted on women in the army why do we only get trumpets we were promised guns that's the way it is that's the way it'll stay argh okay you might actually find these genuinely funny but in that case you seriously scare me br br additionally i have seen better acting in the kind of soft porn films you get on european late night tv so it had lame jokes delivered badly beyond lower average acting lacked pace was badly dubbed and edited  it just didn't work at least not on any level used as a measure for films br br i would even be so bold as to say that this flick proves that there are people who can be a lot less funny zan zee germans and that's saying something if you like stereotypes which i don't it's nice to play with them though just in case somebody thinks i'm not being pc enough br br instead of going to see this film do something useful try to teach crocheting to prawns paint your toenails in a really irritating colour disassemble your bicycle change some light bulbs try to understand einstein's theories convert to a different religion and back in fact go and listen to last christmas by wham on endless repeat anything but don't watch this awful flick
that's what one of the girls said at the end br br is the soccer game a metaphor for a qualifying game between the girls or more broadly a free thinking group and the authority to germany means to a future that's of hope br br it's one of the most unforgettable cinematic experience i've ever had despite the crude cinematography and plot and mild over acting though i like the cast they're lovable and well above the expectation for amateurs the ridiculous situation is well captured i can feel the deep frustration being denied to a game being female and a soccer fan and i cannot stop thinking how to make a convincing disguise i wonder why there's no women's section in which protection from dirty language and bad behavior can be provided defeating the flawed reasons for the deny br br the movie is very cleverly made the amazing title the filming during the actual game the spontaneity and various methods to put the viewers into the shoes of the characters the game that's so important but inaccessible not shown the luring light and cheering sound from the stadium the confinement of the van and the uselessness of it when those inside connect with the celebrating crowds outside i can feel the comfort coming from the radio the drinks and the food and of course the kindness and consideration from each character to others during the end credits i am amused that no character has a name he's just any soldier and she's just any girl or sister
i bought this it was only 3 ok under the title grey matter the novelty of seeing sherriff roscoe in a non dukesofhazzard role intrigued me as the other reviewers warned it's a pretty boring tale of a top secret government experiment gone awry br br and yes there are plenty of establishing shots especially of a house with a pool in front of it some of the characters and interiors are so nondescript i guess the filmmakers worried we might forget who is who so they keep tipping us off by first showing the outside of the buildings it's actually kinda funny after awhile the pool shot feels like a tv channel's station identification logo reminding us that we are watching grey matter br br i also enjoyed two bouts of name calling at one point an angry test subject taunts somebody in charge by calling her a scientific b tch it's just a very inadequate insult several scenes later a different subject lets off steam by muttering about that scientific b tard it just sounded very awkward to me br br someday this movie will disappear forever another decade from now it will likely be impossible to find any copies of it almost like it never happened br br
well where do i begin my story i went to this movie tonight with a few friends not knowing more than the actors that were in it and that it was supposed to be a horror movie br br well i figured out within the first 20 minutes what a poor decision i had made going out seeing this movie the plot was crap and so was the script the lines were horrible to the point that people in the audience were laughing hysterically br br the cast couldn't have been more plastic looking even some of the scenes seemed like they should have been made much quicker like they dragged on for no particular reason very poor editing br br all in all this movie was a giant waste of time and money boo
if you were ever sad for not being able to get a movie on dvd it was probably 'delirious' you were looking for how often do you laugh when watching stand up comedy routines i was too young to see richard pryor during his greatest time and when i was old enough to see eddie murphy's 'delirious' and 'raw' not as funny i never knew where eddie got a big part of his inspiration now that i'm older and have seen both pryor and many of the comedians after murphy i realize two things everybody steals from eddie while eddie lovingly borrowed from richard that's the huge difference eddie was original funny provocative thoughtful  and more he was something never before seen he was all we ever needed these days eddie murphy is boring and old  but once upon a time he was the king and 'delirious' was the greatest castle ever built truly one of the funniest routines of all time
ok i would not normally watch a farrelly brothers movie i can't recall ever watching one i also don't recall watching a jimmy fallon movie alright i did watch taxi but i said penance and was forgiven for that mistake but this movie had drew barrymore and i just think she is the cutest thing i don't know what it is about her but i just smile the whole time i am watch her she just captivates me that way i mean i even watched adam sandler just to see her in 50 first dates how sad is that this wasn't the greatest baseball movie it wasn't supposed to be it was a love story about a sad puppy that hung on to the only thing that never let him down until he found something worth giving that up for it had a predictable ending but there was so much on the way there that made it worthwhile
not much to say on this one a plot you can pretty much peg in the first 10 minutes nothing overly wrong with this film very little action for an action film there was a chance to explore the characters emotions occasionally whether an action film is the right genre to do that with i'm still undecided sniper was one of the easiest films to watch without giving full attention to as it had little twists and a straightforward plot i was probably guilty of that so with a second watch or with undivided attention it may be better br br 4 10 but the best of my 4 out of 10's
this had a great cast with big name stars like tyrone power henry fonda randolph scott nancy kelly henry hull and brian donlevey and a bunch more lesser but known names with shorter roles it also had technicolor one of the few movies made with it in 1939 br br now the bad news regrettably i can't say much positive for the story it portrayed the james boys in a totally positive light and hollywood has done that ever since why these criminals are always shown to be the good guys is beyond me this film glamorizes them and made their enemies the railroad people into vicious human beings the latter was exaggerated so much it was preposterous well that's the film world for you evil is good good is bad br br hey hollywood here's a news flash the james boys were criminals really look it up
at first sight this movie doesn't look like a particular great one after all a bette davis movies with only 166 votes on imdb and a rating of 6 5 must be a rather bad one but the movie turned out to be a delightful and original surprise br br you would at first expect that this is a normal average typical '30's movie with a formulaic love story but the movie is surprisingly well constructed and has an unusual and original story which also helps to make this movie a very pleasant one to watch br br the story is carried by its two main characters played by bette davis and george brent their helped by a cast of mostly amusing characters but the movie mainly involves just around them two their character are involved in a most unusual and clever written love story that work humorous as well it makes this movie a delightful little comedy to watch that is perfectly entertaining br br the movie is quite short just over an hour long which means that the story doesn't waste any time on needless plot lines development and characters it makes the movie also rather fast paced which helps to make this movie a perfectly watchable one by todays standards as well it does perhaps makes the movie a bit of a simple one at times but this never goes at the expense of its entertainment or fun br br a delightful pleasant simple romantic comedy that deserves to be seen by more br br 8 10
big spoilers i've seen one other takashi miike film and that was the very disturbing and brutal 'audition' which was an examination of the japanese ideals of femininity in 'visitor q' which i think means 'visitor question' he examines in a very disturbingly gross way the family unit miike's surreal vision of a dysfunctional family almost tries to be lynchian in terms of confusion and film making but ultimately lacks the style and intrigue we the audience are introduced to a bizarre array of scenarios from the opening scene with the father figure kenichi endo who was actually quite good paying for sex with his displaced daughter fujiko then as the father returns home he is struck on the head by the visitor kazushi watanabe wielding a fairly sizeable rock and for some reason they both end up back at the family home the mother shungiku uchida is beaten and bullied by her son jun muto who is also beaten and bullied by his school peers when the visitor enters the home he somewhat menacingly establishes himself as part of the unit eventually the family begin to improve their relationship with assistance from the visitor through milking breasts murder and retaining a sense of family pride br br and there are other crazy scenes that somehow bring the family closer together it's has uncomfortable humour but is equally frustratingly silly and over the top in its weirdness there is a necrophiliac scene that is utterly disgusting but ends up being ridiculously funny as the scene progresses partly because of the situation itself and partly because you can't believe the filmmakers and the actors are actually doing this the style of the film is poor to say the least and the plot is stupid and unbelievably weak the characters themselves are all over the place and while i understand this is not meant to be realistic there is hardly any interest in these confronting characters and situations as all of them border on the absurd the camera work is sloppy and doesn't have that cinematic feel that lynch's work entails it's hard to take this film seriously on a surrealist level or on an interpretation of examining the family unit in japan it just seems that miike was out to shock and the film seems self aware that it's trying to be shocking and it becomes almost comical to be taken seriously all in all i would say that this film is a bizarrely dark comedy but it looks and feels amateurish and seems to unnecessarily want to shock miike's previous film audition was finely balanced between disgusting horror character development and technique which established more intrigue in the way the film was crafted to allow the viewer to become engrossed with the plot 'visitor q' is a step down as it tries too hard to be outlandishly bizarre and intentionally confronting without really having much to say in the process br br out of
i am a massive fan of jet li he is the best hk action film star alive and consequently this film rocked i saw it in the video store and as it was in the mainstream section of this mainstream video store i didnt register its presence at first and had to look twice i immediately knew what i would be renting out my only qualm i suppose i expected it is that it was dubbed aaargh and not subtitled elsewise the movie's original strange cool plot and full on action made it one of jet li's better movies even though they all fall under that category
two women sick of their controlling husbands taking a vacation in italy for a month with two other very different women they come back refreshed and energized in this wonderful little film by merchant ivory br br great scenery and the location isn't bad either seriously a very good period piece 7 of 10
i was 15 years old when this movie premiered on the television being raised in texas i understood the boredom monotony of teenage life there this movie touched my impressionable teenage heart i remembered it fondly through the past 12 years i recently got to see it for the 2nd 3rd 4th times thanks the the love channel i still cry because the movie reaches in touches my inner confused teenager
i chose to see this movie because it got a good score here on imdb but a lot of people either have really poor taste or someone's been fixing the score br br either way it was a real disappointment the movie is exactly as stupid and far fetched as the title would suggest there really is no reason to give a summary of the plot but here goes it felt like someone had been thinking wouldn't it be cool to make a movie where there were snakes on a plane and then the snakes for some reason would go crazy and start biting and stuff and that's about it the plot is thin and unoriginal the snakes are bad cgi but it makes sense to cut corners on a movie that no one in their right mind will recommend to anyone the acting is poor and all people are unbelievable stereo types br br to sum it up it's one of the worst movies i've ever seen stay away
i watch a lot of films good bad and indifferent there is usually something of interest to fixate upon even if it is only set design or the reliable labor of a good character actor or the fortuitous laughter that emerges from watching ineptitude captured forever br br however i was quite pleasantly surprised by this film one i had never seen before graham greene has been translated into film many times of course in such masterpieces as thin man and in lesser vehicles confidential agent is one of those lesser vehicles yet it manages to get me somewhere anyway despite lackluster direction the incongruity of bacall and boyer's depictions as respectively british and spanish and the almost complete non existence of any chemistry between the two leads in some ways this last problem actually begins to work in the film's favor for how can love really blossom in the killing atmosphere of fascism and capitalism meeting about one person's tragedy the most compelling aspect of the film arises directly from greene's complex and guilt ridden psychology which pervades the film i know some see the deliberate pacing here as dull and i can understand that yet i found that plodding accentuated rather than detracted from what is a claustrophobic world i was compelled to watch not by any great acting although boyer is marvelous as usual managing to convey a rich mixture of world weariness tragedy hope and fervor with his magnificent voice and yearning eyes but by the down spiraling rush of one man's slim hopes against a world of oppression and money what is a thief what good is love in the face of death where does mere profit taking end and exploitation begin the film does not rise to the level of art and thus cannot hope to answer such questions but it is much more than mere entertainment and its murders and guilts are very grimly drawn the lack of glitz of bubble of narrative bounce help to make this movie very worthwhile br br and there is no happy ending for history wrote the ending
this movie is wonderful it always has been always will be i'm mean really what is better then a house maid falling in love walt really out did him self here and the music a dream is a wish your heart makes is beautiful what else can you say besides terrific i can't wait until the special edition comes out it will be so awesome i can't wait to hear all of the deleted songs this movie is done so beautiful and smart it is lovely what about the cute mice too i know i keep saying the same things over and over and over again but hey this is a great movie woods was terrific in this beautiful beautiful beautiful movie
in some ways the wrath of kriemhild surpasses siegfried's death but it also loses some of that film's greatness the plot of this one is more cohesive than the first which is quite amazing the second half of the actual poem is a lot sloppier and a lot harder to tread through until that is you get to the climactic battle scenes only the iliad's are better lang and harbou embellished the huns the poet compiler of the nibelungenlied didn't know a hun from his right ball and as a result they are more or less the same as the burgundians in custom for example although the poet clearly describes etzel as a heathen which is kriemhild's main concern as rudiger tries to persuade her to marry him when she gets to hunland the first thing she does is go to mass the huns here are clearly heathens they're almost like caveman the depiction of them is hilarious especially verbal the jester who has two marvelous scenes etzel's character has been given more weight he is much more formidable all he does is bemoan his fate in the original poem lang and harbou are masterful at building suspense especially at the banquet scene which is intercut with verbal's second performance to an amazing effect however as is the nature of this half of the poem the film's amazing technical accomplishments are missing in this one for the most part except for a dazzling sequence where etzel's hall burns down with the nibelungs inside the one thing i do have to object to is the way harbou changes the ending spoilers in the poem after hildebrand captures hagen and gunther they are imprisoned kriemhild visits hagen in his cell and demands that he reveal where he has hidden the horde he refuses and she herself decapitates her brother when hagen still refuses she decapitates him hildebrand or possibly dietrich is so disgusted that a woman would presume to murder a great warrior that he in turn decapitates her calling her a devil woman etzel who is much weaker in the poem than he is here says something silly like ah me i can understand why they would want to keep a unity of time and place as hildebrand brings them from the castle to retain the prison settings of the two deaths would make the film very anticlimactic i also understand why they didn't have hildebrand kill kriemhild his character is much reduced here his name is only mentioned once but to have kriemhild kill herself adopting brynhild's death from the icelandic sources is just catering to the audience instead of challenging them the point of the poem is that kriemhild's wrath goes far beyond it should into the realm of pure evil here we simply have her die for her lost love it's not as interesting
i think a round of applause is in order for whoever pieced together the trailer for rogue pictures' latest release 'the return' i myself along with everyone else have been duped into believing it is in fact a horror film on the contrary though its actually a supernatural thriller too bad it is not the least bit thrilling br br 'the return' stars sarah michelle gellar as joanna mills a young woman who has had personal problems since the age of eleven it was at that age that she began having haunting visions depicting the murder of a woman whom she has never met while in texas on a business trip she is led by these visions to the murdered woman's hometown la salle there she comes face to face with another person who has frequently appeared in her visions a man by the name of terry stahl who is played by peter o'brien joanna is now on a desperate search for answers a search that could in the end result in her very own murder br br i really don't know where to begin here folks which should i mention first the atrocious acting hideous directing or the terribly bland story no matter which one i choose my point behind each is the same they simply suck adam sussman's screenplay is downright moronic its not interesting its not compelling its just plain unpleasant i kept waiting for something to jumpstart the film i've placed quotations around film because i don't believe 'the return' deserves to be called an actual film due to it's foulness and at least give it some slight chance of hope but nothing ever happened i was left out in an unbearable cold to freeze not even stellar performances from the actors themselves could have saved this disaster of course they probably knew this having read the script then agreeing to do the film i assume this is why the acting was so awful at least that's what i'm choosing to believe i really hope the cast doesn't pride themselves on their performances they need immediate medical attention if they do br br now the directing was unmistakably bad but i can't quite crucify asif kapadia entirely well i could but i won't since i'm such a nice guy i look at 'the return' as a test for kapadia because for all of you that don't know this is his first full length feature film he's just getting his foot in the door and still learning next time around well if there is a next time hopefully he will have improved vastly the only thing he was able to accomplish here was almost completely duplicating the visual style of marcus nispel's 2003 re make of 'the texas chainsaw massacre' now that's nice the film was given that but unfortunately he still won't be receiving any kudos from me for that copying someone else's work isn't something i consider to be praise worthy even if it is from a film i very much enjoyed br br i think jim sonzero's american re make of 'pulse' will now have to fork over the title of worst film of the year to 'the return' it beyond question is deserving of the title in almost every imaginable way now i don't doubt this will make a small and i mean very small profit no matter what though it won't surpass or even parallel the fluke success of gellar's previous acting effort 'the grudge' on that note there's one last thing i'd like to add i can honestly say i had never been embarrassed to have been seen leaving a theater auditorium until seeing 'the return' that is something i never wish to experience again along with the film itself
silly often ridiculous romp involving the landing of a space ship and the resulting havoc this causes on tim jeff daniels and the people in his orbit br br am always amazed by daniels he showed such depth and promise in 1983's terms of endearment as shirley maclaine's philandering son in law as the years have passed daniels has been unable to get his hands on a good meaty role instead he is in inane comedies such as dumb and dumber br br as for this picture it fails because of the subject matter at least the television show brought about a variety of situations in the film we have constant slapstick and people turning into monsters as the government is thwarted into capturing the martian martin br br the part of mrs brown is a perfect example of the non success of the film on television pamela britton portrayed a ditsy individual caught up in situations with the martian leaving her perplexed in the film version a blond bomb shell as brown tries romantic entanglement br br television star ray walston has a small role as a government agent or is he really that br br a very big disappointment for those who enjoyed the television show so much
painfully bad christmas film that has an equally painfully bad performance by vince vaughn who is paying his usual frat boy self but this time for a children's movie but with out the wit or charm that is in his r rated films vaughn seems like he's on autopilot though most of the film and he keeps running into walls with his lackluster performance after 30 minutes into the film you would be in touch your inner scourge and say bahumbag at how unfunny this film is and after another 30 minutes you will want to walk out over how unbearable the film has gotten during that point out of all the actors involved in this mess only paul giamatti and rachel weisz brings some life to there perspective paper thin roles and that's manly because they are both way too good of actors to be in this film paul giamatti brings some depth and warmth to the character of saint nick himself but he's forced to vaughn's level of juvenile behavior when they are doing their sad sibling infighting you can see in giamatti face that he's not having fun with his role and it painfully shows in certain parts of the film rachel weisz brings a sense of fun and spirit to her role but she really does not have much of a character to work with and you can see in her face that she's well aware of that so much so that she seems irritated in certain parts of the film fortunately for her she's not in the film much at all and is able to save some face unlike giamatti who looks like he's about to fire his agent by the end of the movie the direction also feels uninspiring like there is no feeling or flow to be had and this is a supposed to be a holiday movie but it ends up feeling like you are just staring at a fancy widow display that is being torn down br br i don't know what went wrong here but with only two actors involved giamatti and weisz trying their best to at least bring something to the table with a unfunny script they had to work with spotty direction with no feeling for the subject at hand and this is a christmas movie of all things and a actor who just does not care about his performance vaughn you have a very unevenly bad film that is very painful to watch
first of all i apologize for my english br br everybody from ex yugoslavia who isn't some extreme serbian radical will agree with me this movie shows serbian side and only serbian side no serbian crimes were represented luckily everyone can see that this movie was made by serbians so there is no neutrality all ''professionals'' who were interviewed are not professionals at all some guy only read a book written by some radical serbian the other one is genocide denier etc etc br br even slovenians were accused in this movie and the whole war in slovenia lasted for few days and only because slovenians were lucky there weren't many serbs in slovenia and yna couldn't reach slovenia trough croatia after croatia serbia war started every slovenian is outraged by all accusations in this movie br br every reasonable croat will agree with one thing the independence was too early perhaps all major conflicts could be avoided however mentioning wwii and some unrelated things was truly pathetic attempt to justify everything just imagine japanese throwing nuclear bombs at seattle and washington and saying that was justified by hiroshima and nagasaki you will find no evidence about strangled yna soldier and murdered serbian civilians near vukovar but you can find the tape with reporter committing that his claims about serbian civilians near vukovar were lies all over the internet and the director forgot to mention the whole bombing of vukovar by yna now on serbian and montenegro side and 100 full of serbs and montenegrin and let's not start about the chetnik movement at the beginning it was simply a resistance movement but director somehow forgot to mention collaboration with the nazis including ustashe ethnic cleansing and fighting again the yugoslav partisans there are thousands of other things but all of it can be easily checked there are many misleading things in this movie only few of all accusations are true every croatian is outraged by this movie br br i believe that i don't need to mention srebrenica genocide denial the genocide that has too many evidence imagine the movie about holocaust denial this movie is the same and according to this movie bosnian muslims in sarajevo bombed themselves every bosnian muslim is outraged by this movie br br somehow director forgot to mention the short occupation of small piece of macedonian fyrom land by the serbs br br croatians slovenians bosnians and macedonians never entered serbian borders if you are not serbian and you actually started to believe some things from this movie know that serbs have some kind of propaganda that croats bosnian muslims and macedonians are actually serbs who made up their history so br br even 50 of serbs will say that this movie is ''little'' extreme and pro serbian br br and serbian radicals are very very pleased with this movie there is about 40 serbs who vote for radicals br br i think everyone understands my points in here in this so called documentary is very little truth and my advice to everyone is inform yourself before watching this movie after that you will only laugh at all pathetic accusations br br watch real neutral documentaries about death of yugoslavia
yes i'll admit it i believed all the hype surrounding this piece of work about the trials and tribulations of 6 people living in mexico city concerning their sexual lives and so i was really expecting to finally see a mexican movie in ages that was both popular and interesting to watch unfortunately the film was utterly disappointing the story presents us with two couples both with very obvious marital problems when a third party comes into the life of each couple their problems reach a pivotal point or absolute absurd the plot then turns into a battle of the sexes the stance taken by each group yes they literally group girls with girls and boys with boys is blatantly stupid and childish i guess the humor was supposed to be there and it all goes from bad to worse the performances range from good miss zavaleta to mediocre mr bichir with serrano doing an acceptable job on his opera prima however the flat circumstances that make up the plot the one dimensional characters the very poor if not stupid perception of what sex represents in a mature relationship etc make the movie fail miserably spyl has had an impressive good reception at the box office believe the hype at your own risk
an old family story told to two young girls by their grandfather is brought to life 16 years later as he foretold br br people are getting murdered and blood is being spilled and rats are scampering all over and naked bodies are being enjoyed br br kitty barbara bouchet is the suspect but we know she is not the killer is it franziska marina malfatti is it evelyn back from death for revenge is it a plot to steal an inheritance the color is superb in this thriller from emilio miraglia who only did one other giallo as far as i know br br the only thing that spoiled the film was the appearance that several frames were cut out someone calls the police and suddenly they are there trying to save kitty
me and a friend rented this movie because it sounded really good but we were wrong first of the acting wow the acting was the worst the effects were really bad as well it seemed like a film a college kid made the plot was pretty good but it'd been done the thing that ruined the movies the most were the actors the main guy was the worst actor ever it's a shame i'm even calling him an actor the only good thing about this movie was it was so bad it was funny so if you want a good laugh see it but other than that stay far away from this one i usually love b list movies and such but this one i do not know how it was passed to even be put on video this one is the worst i've seen and i've seen some bad ones
this documentary now available free on video google com is a fantastic demonstration of the power of ordinary people to overcome injustice everyone must see this br br chavez was elected in a landslide vote in 1998 his platform was to divert the fantastic oil wealth from the 20 middle class to the 80 poor he banned foreign drift net fishing in venezuelan waters he sent 10 000 cuban doctors to the slums to treat the sick for free he wiped out illiteracy and set up new free universities br br but it was his 30 tax on oil company profits that got him in trouble with the bush administration in 2002 while irish film makers kim bartley and donnacha o'briain were interviewing chavez inside the presidential palace about his social programs a cia backed coup was launched with the cameras rolling chavez was captured and flown out of the country it was announced on national tv that he had 'resigned' br br but the poor of venezuela didn't believe the media they went to the palace in their millions and demanded that chavez be returned in the face of such overwhelming numbers the military turned on the coup leaders and the plotters fled to the us chavez was rescued by military helicopter and returned to jubilation
good work by everyone from scriptwriters director and cast a lovely fun film that becomes believable for sentimental reasons only a good film for television on those cloudy cold wintry days when you just want to sit back and enjoy
a number of contributors have mentioned the age difference between stewart and novak she was 25 and he was 50 when this movie was released i think that the difference didn't matter for a suspense drama like vertigo but it does matter for a romantic comedy we can easily understand that is why his character would be attracted to hers but it's less clear why hers would be attracted to his br br still the movie works as a light romantic fantasy the scene where she stares at him across the cat's head with her dark painted on eyebrows flaring and the sounds of her humming and the cat purring is true magic it's a little jarring therefore when the scene shifts to the top of the flatiron building and we see the age difference very sharply as he embraces her she reaches up to run her fingers through his hair but stops that motion and just brushes her fingertips lightly against his toupee
the brilliant thing about withnail i is that it captures that not long left college and life could go either way moment along with all its other finery freebird is something for those who probably never considered higher education and just went straight to work aged 15 16 i know some of the broad sheets stuck the knife into this film when it came out in cinemas but i saw it at a packed house in hailsham and everybody seemed to really enjoy it i grew up in the forest of dean and this took me straight back to my mushrooming and dope days had some great mates hate to think what they're all up to now probably running the local council i've watched it a couple of times on dvd and already i see the film as an old mate that will stay forever as part of my collection how can i like this film and the dambusters doesn't seem right somehow i certainly edge towards the second half of this film and i think the social interacting scenes with the locals are brilliantly done i like the mix of the three lead characters and there really is some lovely writing in here along with some very quotable lines and dare i say a good smattering of integrity i have tried to obtain the soundtrack but it has not been released shame as it's a corker someone told me it was originally a stage play not quite sure how that worked but i'm sure it was fun i liked the little shakespearian touches references that seem to crop up throughout the film also spotted the dylan thomas ref as well and like all little gems there will always be little things to discover like the final scene giving a nod to easyrider as they start they're next journey all in all a genuinely unpretentious piece of film making love it
personally i couldn't get into 'this is not a love song' its a brilliant film and there's a great story line to it i just found myself checking the time on my phone every two minuets to see how much was left of the film br br i love the relationship between spike and heaton there that close they depend on each other to get along in life at the same time i wish the relationship was more than what it is heaton is in love with spike but spike ibsen't in love with heaton or he doesn't know how to love him the acts of betrayal on both parts have a big effect on the two men they are both devastated by the fact that the other ran away and abandoned them at a time when they truly needed each other for survival
fred claus somehow avoids becoming this year's the santa clause by at least having a bit more amusing moments than that tim allen starrer but it doesn't mean that it's got enough going for it that's worth a trip to the theater br br as holiday movies go it's contrived and sentimental but actually that could be the least of one's concern as fred claus boasting of having david dobkin shanghai knights the wedding crashers at the helm contains virtually nary a genuinely funny moment as it clumsily treads the line between a boorish vince vaughn vehicle and a fuzzy christmas film in the end it amounts to not much of both and with a cast that comprises of paul giamatti kevin spacey rachel weisz and kathy bates all the more it leaves one disappointed br br vaughn plays fred nick's giamatti older and estranged brother who once upon a time left him and their parents bates and trevor peacock after having had enough of enduring his parents' favoritism of his younger sibling nick grows up to be santa claus and as the voice over tells us time freezes on you and your family when you become a saint while fred becomes a yuletide jaded repo man in chicago who's having a hard time remembering his girlfriend wanda's weisz birthday br br he runs in trouble with the law and had to call his younger brother who eerily looks at least a decade older than him to bail him out of jail nick agrees but only if fred agrees to help out on the toy wrapping business up in the north pole fred reluctantly agrees but his cynicism clashes with santa and the elves' perpetually cheery nature even as an efficiency expert spacey is checking on the toy factory operations only too happy to have the whole arctic operations shut down if things fail br br the film as said does have its moments but the padded running length stretches them thin across its duration in between are piles of christmas film clichés that were handled better in say elf and the attempts at sentimentality are as endearing as last year's fruitcake br br vaugn as usual brings on his coarse charm to the table but the neutered script of dan fogelman keeps him from really doing his thing giamatti underneath the bad fat suit brings a jolly old charm to his iconic character but unfortunately has to play second fiddle to fred spacey brings his game face but his turns usually end as unfunnily vapid br br ultimately fred claus becomes a forgettable film that falls below what those involved in it deserve sure there are worse ways to start the season at the cinema but there are certainly far better ways

well was morgan freeman any more unusual as god than george burns this film sure was better than that bore oh god i was totally engrossed and lmao all the way through carrey was perfect as the out of sorts anchorman wannabe and aniston carried off her part as the frustrated girlfriend in her usual well played performance i for one don't consider her to be either ugly or untalented i think my favorite scene was when carrey opened up the file cabinet thinking it could never hold his life history see if you can spot the file in the cabinet that holds the events of his bathroom humor i was rolling over this one well written and even better played out this comedy will go down as one of this funnyman's best
steven spielberg produced wrote came up with ideas for and even directed episodes of amazing stories so naturally this would have to be the greatest anthology ever right unfortunately wrong some episodes are just fantastic but all too often it was a mixed bag in fact that might have been it's downfall is it was way too mixed some episodes were light comedies some were dramas some were horror and one was even animated which made this a similar but not as good 80s version of the twilight zone which also was around br br normally i'd like having a mixture of stories in an anthology show but they just didn't fully work here some of the more fantastical dramatic episodes felt like they would be better being shown late on night on the lifetime network like the episode ghost train which was directed by spielberg himself in that episode it gave the message of hope and gave us a fantasy story but overall it was just a build up to the ending which didn't blow me away anyways the horror episodes tended to work better than the drama but there were far more dramatic ones and they grow tiring to watch acting wise this anthology got some big stars similar to the original twilight zone kevin costner kiefer sutherland milton berle dom deluise harvey keitel beau bridges charlie sheen forrest whitaker tim robbins john lithgow rhea perlman danny devito patrick swayze christopher lloyd june lockhart kathy baker weird al yankovich and many other well knowns have been in episodes of the show it's fun to see well known actors in almost every episode of the series great directors have also had part in episodes including spielberg himself clint eastwood burt reynolds bob clark joe dante mick garris paul bartel joe dante robert zemeckis danny devito and even martin scorsese i'd actually recommend this more to fans of the directors and or the 80s than anyone else br br amazing stories was sometimes amazing usually good occasionally mediocre and every once in a while a real stinker came out but this show has nostalgic value to me and it's sort of fun to sit on boring afternoons and watch some episodes john williams' theme music for the show is sure to be caught in anyone's head who watches this too br br my rating good show 30 mins per episode tvpg
i was drawn to this movie the moment i saw a preview of it on oscar night when i read about kay pollak i was hooked we americans are suckers for a comeback kid br br i understand this movie was a huge draw in sweden as a very provincial american i can only speculate on the reason perhaps it is because of the provocative joke that the lena character makes at the beginning of the movie and other social comment but perhaps it is because of the central message which i believe has the same appeal everywhere in affluent societies br br the message of this movie for me is the same as the movie titanic life is short people and as far as anyone really knows it's all we've got it can be taken away at any time so isn't it a pity that we spend so much time hiding behind walls separating us from other people because we're so afraid of being hurt tearing down the walls is painful but feeling alive lies on the other side of those wretched walls feeling alive is worth taking the risk give and you will receive so start living now br br many people are criticizing this movie for it's lack of characterization and other flaws i say you are all pseudo sophisticated get a grip folks it's a parable a fable for we affluent westerners who are materially rich but whose souls are in abject poverty br br so join a choir or a band or help build housing or distribute food for those less fortunate than you spread some joy and make the world a better place as long as you get out and commune with your fellow man writing a check is not enough we are a social species by the way even the humblest of your fellow human beings can affect you in ways you never thought possible br br rugged individualism has its place but it is over rated
sometimes a premise starts out good but because of the demands of having to go overboard to meet the demands of an audience suffering from attention deficit disorder it devolves into an incongruous mess and for three well respected actors who have made better work before and after this is a mortal shame br br so let's see premise a loving couple who lives in a beautiful home is threatened by a bad cop interesting to say the least make the encroaching cop a little disturbing why not it was well done in the hand who rocks the cradle and single white female and it's a proved ticket to a successful thriller br br now herein lies the dilemma create a disturbing story that actually bothers to bring some true menace into its main characters while never going so far as to look ridiculous or throw any semblance to reality amp up the shock factor and make this cop so extreme an ultra bad variation of every other super villain that's hit cinemas since the silent age br br the producers and directors chose the latter thus is the resulting film badly made with actors trying their darnedest to make heads or tails in roles that they've essayed before and nothing much amounting to even less
what can i say ms erika eleniak is my favorite blonde girl ever and like a italian american fan number one of female beauty i can't forget this movie br br you know i really don't remember a lot about the plot or the situations or the other actors i only can remember about drop dead gorgeous erika and that in this film she looks better than ever i really don't care if it was a bad movie or a good movie i only care the nice moments i had been a teenager in brooklyn just contemplating erika's beauty br br well just to conclude if you are an erika eleniak's beauty fan like me definitely this film is for you
so altogether i found this documentary to be strange and really pointless i know it got awards and things but i personally did not enjoy it too much there was no humor or drama in it to keep you interested just a bunch of wierdos and their jobs some of the people in are rather different which isn't a bad thing it just didn't leave a good impression on me i was thoroughly bored by this movie no offense to my creative writing teacher the circus theme throughout the whole movie was kinda cool but i didn't get it and robotics and lion taming is definitely not my thing the green animals thing was neat i really liked the garden lots of colorful flowers but how did these four jobs connect it just didn't make much sense to me why someone would make a movie about that but if you are into stuff like this you might enjoy it who am i to stand in your way i am just forewarning you about possible suffering
jess is 18 very smart and wants nothing more than to play football when she joins a local team she has to lie to her parents again and again as they would never approve of her chasing her dream they want her to settle down with a nice indian boy and learn how to cook br br bend it like beckham is a very funny feel good movie that doesn't need to be deep and complex it's just fine as it is the cast are all very good and they play their roles very well the story is simple and predictable but it works perfectly and the script is very realistic and very funny br br a great family movie 8 10
sur mes lèvres or read my lips is fine little thriller that also examines the lives of 'outsiders' people who live in the periphery of our vision who struggle with the need to 'fit in' director jacques audiard with and co writer tonino benacquista have created a tense tight completely entertaining little thriller that makes some significant statements about out of the norm individuals and their plights br br carla emmanuelle devos is a plain jane mostly deaf thirty something unnoticed secretary for a company whose life is one of social and sexual isolation and whose view of the future is rather bleak enter paul vincent cassel a recent released ex con parolee who responds to an ad to be carla's assistant there is a mutual physical repulsion at first meeting carla had hoped for a well groomed genteel man who might fulfill her fantasies and paul is a coarse unkempt sleazy guy who is not impressed with being a clerk their concepts change rather quickly when paul salvages carla's job by filling her request to steal a letter that would cost her her job and paul discovers carla's lip reading ability which he sees as a way to spy on the criminals from his past who threaten his life for money owed so this odd couple of a team join forces and together enter a dangerous suspense filled ploy to gain paul's safety and freedom the relationship is full of twists and edge of the seat suspense with each of these unlikely characters fulfilling roles in their lives that fill the chinks in their walls of isolation in surprising ways br br devos and cassel deliver bravura performances and the remainder of the cast is uniformly strong once again alexandre desplat has produced a musical score that enhances the tension and cinematographer mathieu vadepied finds all the right lighting and angles to suggest the worlds of isolation of the characters as well as the hitchcockian sense of suspense director audiard wisely manipulates a factor that is at once sensitive and transformative for the story he shows us the difference between 'hearing' the world with and without hearing aids and in doing so makes some powerful social comments this is a fine film that remains in the ranks of the best of the french film noir genre recommended grady harp

i remember i loved this movie when it came out i was 12 years old had a commodore 64 and loved to play rambo on it i was therefore really thrilled when i got to buy this movie really cheap i put it in my vcr and started up man this movie is really bad sylvester stallone says like 3 words in the entire movie except for that awful sentimental speech at the end and has the same expression on his face all the way and that stupid love thing in the middle it's just so amazingly predictable i just ended up fast forwarding the entire thing and went to exchange the movie for something else
title zombie 3 1988 br br directors mostly lucio fulci but also claudio fragasso and bruno mattei br br cast ottaviano dellacqua massimo vani beatrice ring deran serafin br br review br br to review this flick and get some good background of it i gotta start by the beginning and the beginning of this is really george romeros dawn of the dead when dawn came out in 79 lucio fulci decided to make an indirect sequel to it and call it zombie 2 that film is the one we know as plain ole zombie you know the one in which the zombie fights with the shark ok so after that flick named zombie 2 in italy came out and made a huge chunk of cash the italians decided heck lets make some more zombie flicks these things are raking in the dough so zombie 3 was born confused yet the story on this one is really just a rehash of stories we've seen in a lot of american zombie flicks that we have seen before this one the best comparison that comes to mind is return of the living dead lets see there's the government making experiments with a certain toxic gas that will turn people into zombies canister gets released into the general population and shebang we get loads of zombies yearning for human flesh a bunch of people start running away from the zombies and end up in an old abandoned hotel they gotta fight the zombies to survive br br there was a lot of trouble during the filming of this movie first and foremost lucio fulci the beloved godfather of gore from italy was sick so he couldn't really finish this film the way that he wanted to the film was then handed down to two lesser directors bruno mattei hell of the living dead and claudio fragasso zombie 4 they did their best to spice up a film that was already not so good you see fulci himself didn't really have his heart and soul on this flick he was disenchanted with it he gave the flick over to the producers and basically said do whatever the hell you want with it and god love them they did br br and that is why ladies and gents we have such a crappy zombie flick with the great fulci credited as its director the main problem in my opinion is that its just such a pointless bore there's no substance to it whatsoever after the first few minutes in which some terrorists steal the toxic gas and accidentally release it the rest of the flick is just a bunch of empty soulless characters with no personality whatsoever running from the zombies now in some cases this can prove to be fun if 1 the zombie make up and zombie action is actually good and fun and 2 there's a lot of gore and guts involved br br here we get neither well there's some inspired moments in there like for example when some eagles get infected by the gas and they start attacking people that was cool there's also a scene involving a flying zombie head wich by the way defies all logic and explanation and a scene with zombies coming out of the pool of the abandoned hotel and munching off a poor girls legs but aside from that the rest of the flick just falls flat on its ass br br endless upon endless scenes that don't do jack to move the already non existent plot along that was my main gripe with this flick the sets look unfinished and the art direction is practically non existent i hate it when everything looks so damn unfinished i like my b movies but this one just really went even below that its closer to a z level flick if you ask me br br the zombie make up pure crap the zombies are all asian actors the movie was filmed in the philippines so you get a bunch of asian looking zombies but thats not a big problem since they movie was set in the phillipine islands anyway its the look of the zombies that really sucks they all died with the same clothes on for some reason and what passes for zombie make up here is a bunch of black make up more like smudges on their faces one or two zombies had slightly more complex make up but it still wasn't good enough to impress its just a bunch of goo pointlessly splattered on the actors faces so not only is this flick slowly paced but the zombies look like crap these are supposed to be dead folks anyhows for those expecting the usual coolness in a fulci flick don't come expecting it here cause this is mostly somebody else's flick and those two involved mattei and fragasso didn't really put there heart and souls into it in fact when you see the extras on the dvd you will see that when fragasso is asked about his recollections and his feelings on this here flick he doesn't even take it to seriously you can tell he is ashamed of it and in many occasions he says they just had a job to do and they did it and that my friends is the last nail on this flick there's no love and no heart put into making this film therefore you get a half assed crappy zombie flick br br only for completest or people who want to have or see every zombie flick ever made everybody else don't even bother rating 1 out of 5
what starts out as an interesting story quickly disintegrates into nothing don't bother watching to the end hoping for an explanation of what is stalking the visitors there is no ending no explanation no resolution zip this could have been a good movie it they had purchased an entire script
set in providence rhode island feeding the masses tries to be a satiric look at the role of the media in government at best it could be applied to how the us try to control media during the iraq war but it ends up feeling hollow there's never any really tension in the story and the acting never very good worst the direction of the movie is atrocious focus more on odd camera angles that fail to convey anything beyond isn't this an odd way to hold the camera special effects are pretty bad at one point video of an explosion is green screened over the city and it's laughable at best br br the film does have a couple bright spots namely the advertisements for post zombie services including a reclamation service and a party bus but it's far too little to make the film worthwhile br br for a better zombie film try hide and creep it has the same weak production value but there's much more wit humor and talent behind it
i will stat of with the plot alice having survived the previous instalment of the nightmare series finds the deadly dreams of freddy krueger starting once again this time the taunting murderer is striking through the sleeping mind of alice's unborn child his intention is to be born again into the real world the only one who can stop freddy is his dead mother but can alice free her spirit in time to save her own son this movie did start of really well as we see alice dreaming of being amanda kruger who get stuck in room and get raped by 100 manics then she being rushed to hospital but then she not longer the pregnant lady but then she amanda giving birth to freddy again br br alice and dan are the only two people to return from the 4th movie and then have gotten some new friends its' no long before freddy start to kill again i did like the first dead it okay not as good as the other deaths or dreams br br freddy himself didn't seem to be scary in this movie at all the nightmare were just boring really they were not scary or creepy at all br br acting in movies was okay for a 5th movie in the series but overall i think this movie was really dull still not worst movie of the series freddy dead is the worst br br 4 10
the only time i have seen this movie was when i was 10 years old i have remembered it all of these years as i couldn't sleep for a week or more after seeing it it just absolutely rattled me i was on vacation with my aunts in ft worth texas and i will never forget it now 48 years later my daughter is trying to get a copy of this for me to view as an adult it has taken a lot of research to find out what movie it was but i always remembered that barbara stanwyck was in it and finally was able to get the name and reviews on it i very much enjoyed it but it gave me quite a scare jaqui
a number of posters have commented on the unsatisfactory conclusion this is always a problem with long complex dramas crime is essentially banal so the pay off is always anti climactic whilst detailed exposition detracts from the human drama the writer has used a number of clever devices to try and get round this but has not been entirely successful answers to precisely what happened and why may have been supplied but if so they are well buried the viewer inevitably feels a little cheated br br but in a sense this is unimportant the drama was never about the crime or even the investigation it was about the impact of events on the lives of those involved the family the investigators the witnesses the press and as such it was gripping the writing was a significant cut above the run of the mill for prime time drama and the performances uniformly good in an ensemble piece it is invidious to focus on individuals but penelope wilton deserves special mention for an extraordinary tour de force as the mother wife daughter and janet mcteer was in cracking form as a hard bitten old cop br br one of the most interesting aspects of the drama is the handling of race as the elephant in the room that no one is prepared to mention subtle powerful stuff
this movie is just plain bad weak story weak directing and below average acting the thing that really irritated me was the blatant advertising constantly for a well known internet provider it is obvious some scenes are written to do just that advertising this movie is a slap in the face to anyone who payed money for this br br do not watch this it not worth your time
this tv film tells the story of extrovert frannie suddenly returning to silk hope to visit friends and family but unaware of her mother's death her sister runs the family home but is intending to sell it and move away with her new husband frannie strongly objects to the idea and vows to keep the family heirloom as it were by getting a job and maintaining responsibility br br in comes handsome ruben and the two soon fall in love as you do and it's from this point that i sort of lost interest br br there is more to farrah fawcett than just the blonde hair and looks she can portray a character extremely convincingly when she puts her mind to it and it is certainly proved here as well as some of her previous efforts like extremities and small sacrificies a great performance from the legendary charlie's angel br br silk hope is the type of film that never shies away from its cheap and cheerful tv image and you know there was a limit to the budget but it's not the worst film ever made the positive aspects are there you just have to find them
i remember that show i still remember that kick ass fun song america's funniest people frankly it should've been titled american's lame or unfunny or downright disgusting people dave couldn't save this show and neither could bob saget or the replacement hosts for afv that came later the jackalope segments were hilarious and yes dave could make some good voice overs that were better than bob's but this show went to hell because of the lame crappy videos people submitted also it developed as somewhat of a variety show with lame guest stars including the olson twins plus afv was in it's prime before they started picking the drooling ugly as sin babies as the winner did i mentioned the videos were disgusting and lame but still the theme song rocks
now i have seen a lot of movies in my day but out of every single one there have been a very select few that have been really good to me and i'm a 19 year old man which is impressed by this movie directed towards a younger audience this is a very underrated gem for those who watch foreign movies almost all the acting is believable the graphics are decent for which you won't even be caring about as you watch the movie trust me bitching about the graphics would be a stupid thing to do the story is well written and it's a movie that everyone can enjoy not just the kids br br here's basically what this movie made me to it one made me laugh a lot two made me feel for the characters like you're suppose to and three it's a very uplifting story by the end of this movie you will feel good sure what anime out there hasn't featured some young kid turning into a great warrior and whatever to defeat some great evil it's a formula that is used a lot but in this case it is forgivable because even though they use puppets for some characters and some average graphics you'd see 5 years ago the appearance of it is not to be judged it's very touching the ending is original and it keeps you into the movie like it is suppose to if you however try comparing this to other movies like the never ending story or whatever it will diverse your opinion watch it as it is and you will enjoy it br br it has been a good long while since i've been impressed like this the only other movie where i have gotten this feeling is when i saw tmnt way back when it came out there is something about this movie i felt about tmnt that really made me love it so don't over analyze or take this movie too seriously just enjoy it
originally aired as an abc movie of the week this involves two young innocent female college students who are railroaded into a prison camp in a little southern town they aren't allowed phone calls and nobody knows they're there what follows is rape torture beatings humiliation and degradation leading to a very disturbing conclusion br br the tv version was for its time grim no nudity and the beatings were pretty tame but the overall feeling of sleaziness wore one down the unrated version is even worse there's plentiful nudity the violence is extreme and in one particularly disgusting sequence we see a crying female prisoner forced to strip while a lesbian guard uses her yuck there's nothing wrong with exploitation films but this one just goes over the brink you get the feeling that the filmmakers enjoy having these poor women being tortured and degraded all this is shoved in your face like you're supposed to enjoy it the needlessly downbeat ending doesn't help br br i'm giving it a 3 because the acting is good but that actually makes the movie harder to watch a sick sleazy film not recommended
this is a movie about making a movie such movies may be entertaining but they need some substance to do so it did not happen here i am afraid mr coppola did not inherit his father's skills unfortunately neither did his sister who can however make movies which one might watch br br i do wonder how this movie came to get such rave reviews br br let's see the lead male actor supposedly a director is as expressive as a frozen squid and his voice has the same pitch whatever he says the lead female actress has an expression on her face that never changes the plot is totally segmented in bits with perhaps one single connecting element the movie within the movie idea must be more stale than paleolithic rocks would that be enough br br i regretted every single moment i watched this movie a walk with the dog is far superior entertainment to this unbelievably lame movie it's as if a françois truffaut plot were directed by dick cheney br br brazil some other classic sf movies you must be really joking
and ethel merman buffs too will love her loud bossy vocals as the wicked witch mombi but this cartoon sequel to the wizard of oz is bereft of real imagination substituting fantasy and excitement with noisy action and cheaply repeating its footage like a bad music video little dorothy is whisked back to oz which has gone to ruin and meets old and new friends the inelegant animation is stuck somewhere between the weakest walt disney and the less inspired shows from hanna barbera however many of the songs are good particularly dorothy's sweet lament it's a far away land superbly performed by liza minnelli you can count on minnelli for energy which is why the movie perks up whenever dorothy is around much of it is unmemorable and i'm not even sure baby boomers will get a charge from it since it has been out of circulation for so long as a curiosity item just fair from
this movie was very very strange and very very funny all of the actors are quite real and very odd the overall look of the film was different too sort of dreamy and bleached out which only added to the spacey fumbling weird vibe of the whole thing br br it's not for everyone i mean it's not what you would call mainstream but that is what i liked about it it's unlike anything i have ever seen before unpredictable with a weird rhythm and punch lines in the strangest places the kids are so heartbreakingly goofy and pimply that you can't help but feel for them in other words these are far from hollywoodized versions of teenagers br br all of which for me makes it a good thing
i saw that when i was little and it was excellent kelsey white as lisa and the meecy mices where cute susan bonde as doodle and sandra dee heidecke as snoodle where hilarius karen boettcher tate as profster was interesting burl ross as little bunny foo foo was funny gregory donavon as kaiso was brilliant whats hilarius that snoodle and doodle eat too much candy whats sad that little bunny foo foo that bops the meecy mices on the head then by a fairy will give little bunny foo foo few wishes then he turns into goon this story is about when lisa snoodle doodle go to the big rock candy mountains this show is excellent the kids will like this show new words songs and watching them playing
this is one of those movies you see in the video store that you just have to get because it just looks so horribly bad and indeed we couldn't take most of it there was a lot of fast forwarding going on br br but then we came across a scene where robert englund seduces the female protagonist her name somehow slips my mind at this time cripes i've never watched a single scene from a film so many times i'm estimating forty or so and i've never laughed so hard in my life you see englund has this thing for showing off his loins i last saw the film a couple months ago but i can't stop laughing as i type anyway the scene is a montage of shots englund ripping off the lingerie of the girl englund riding a horse naked and some mysterious woman fellating a snake's head this is absolute genius you've got to see it for yourself
i will say that at least the movie makes sense but it's bad the acting for the most part is not good i think only sky showed any promise and you feel awkward watching it all of the scenes that should be meaningful are really shallow like when ng comes out to her parents there are a lot of corny details like the kanji tattoo on the sky's shoulder the magnets on the girls' refrigerator and the god awful decor at the sets and the music and clothes and everything real life has never been like this movie the boy says at one point i'm gay not corny and not aware even the commentary is awful i turned it off after ng talks about how she was weirded out playing a lesbian
in what is arguably the best outdoor adventure film of all time four city guys confront nature's wrath in a story of survival the setting is backwoods georgia with its forests mountains and wild rivers br br the director john boorman chose to use local people not actors to portray secondary characters these locals imbue the film with a depth of characterization unequaled in film history no central casting actors could ever come close to these people's remarkable faces voices or actions i don't recall a film wherein the secondary characters are so realistic and colorful as much as anything else it is this gritty realism that makes this film so amazing br br another strength is the film's theme nature in the wild can be violent how appropriate that the setting should be the american south very few places in the u s are or have been as violent as redneck country in a story about darwinian survival of the fittest the film conveys the idea that humans are part of nature not separate from it br br deliverance is very much a product of its time when unlike today americans expressed concern over a vanishing wilderness the film's magnificent scenery the sounds of birds frogs crickets and the roar of the river rapids combined with the absence of civilization all convey an environmental message and that is another strength of the film br br at an entertainment level the tension gradually escalates as the plot proceeds not even half way into the film the tension becomes extreme and then never lets up not until the final credits roll very few films can sustain that level of intensity over such a long span of plot br br finally the film's technical quality is topnotch direction and editing are flawless cinematography is excellent dialogue is interesting and the acting is terrific burt reynolds has never been better ned beatty is perfectly cast and does a fine job and jon voight should have been nominated for an oscar if there is a weak link in the film it is the music which strikes me as timid br br overall deliverance almost certainly will appeal to viewers who like outdoor adventure even for those who don't the gritty characterizations the acting and the plot tension are reasons enough to watch this film one of the finest in cinema history
i have just watched the whole 6 episodes on dvd the acting throughout is excellent no question there was not quite enough action for me i must say no real suspense as such just plenty of first class character development nothing like tinker tailor in terms of whodunnit if you like a good story slowly and carefully told then this is for you peter egan as the lead magnus pym is excellent br br the film portrayed the life of a traitor a man who should have been a loyal member of the british intelligence service but who was so damaged psychologically by his unhappy childhood that deception became his way of life in all things as a child he adored his father but his father was exposed time time again as a crook and a con man pym betrayed not for ideology or money but because he needed to deceive those closest to him wife son mentor pym is fatally damaged by his father's influence it has eaten his moral fibre away he has no real love or loyalty in him br br heavy psychological stuff and not many light moments in the 6 hour series very well done though
i haven't seen henry fool but after watching fay grim i'm not sure i want to maybe hartley aims to be the anti thriller director he sure succeeded with this yawner based on the official description woman discovers that her dead husband's manuscript contains material that could pose a threat to national security i expected a taut geopolitical drama instead i got flimsy structure goofy dialog flabby characterizations a convoluted plot and a tone that shifts so often it suggests that hartley changed the script according to his mood at any given time i can hang for a long time with a frustrating hard to follow plot e g duplicity because i figure that the loose ends eventually will come together even when they don't or they do but they leave lingering questions e g duplicity sharp writing and acting can hold one's interest but half way through fay grim i reached a deadly realization i didn't know what was going on and i didn't care too bad because i really like parker posey reduced here to working with an absurd part that asked her to morph from indifferent estranged wife and indifferent clueless mother to tough shrewd international player capable of psychological mano a mano with terrorists there's also bad casting jeff goldblum can be very good but he's not capable of overcoming miscasting as a cia operative he looks almost as uncomfortable in the role as i was watching him in it his cia sidekick is worse he looks like a refugee from the quarterfinals of american idol are there really young cia agents with big licks of hair rakishly draped over their foreheads then there's the sticky question of the characters' ages goldblum was 54 when he made fay grim thomas jay ryan who plays henry fool was 44 neither was made to look or seem older than their actual ages yet a key point in the story is that they served as cia agents in nicaragua back in the '70s goldblum's character would've been in his 20s then henry fool would've been a teenager was hartley being quirky or lazy the problems are too numerous to list
serge farnel made a very precise critics of this film in the revue the rwandese night www lanuitrwandaise net br br a critics which shows how france was behind all the situation undergone by the united nations in rwanda br br the un soldiers were in a dangerous situation while the french soldiers were warmly welcomed by the genocide forces br br the day before ten un soldiers had been killed by the genocide forces br br that is why the un soldiers decided to protect their own lives by driving behind the french trucks br br by doing so they gave up the tutsi which is unforgivable of course br br but we must keep in mind that the french soldiers organized this situation
unfortunately the only spoiler in this review is that there's nothing to spoil about that movie even if b mattei had never done any master piece he use to do his job with a bit of humor and craziness that made him a fun eurotrash director but for the last 10 years he seemed to have lost it this film is just empty nothing at all to wake us up from the deep sleep you sink into after the first 10 min no sex no blood it's suppose to be about snuff no actors no dialogs just as bad as an 90't v film it's even worse than his last cannibals and zombies epics so rest in peace bruno you will stay in our minds forever anyway thanks to such unforgettable gems as zombi 3 robowar rats l'altro inferno virus cruel jaws and few others so except if you want to see b mattei possessed by jess franco's spirit's new film pass on this one but if you don't know this nice artisan's career track down his old films and have fun
watching a videotaped replay of about 8 various 1994 1997 spider man cartoons made me realize why i couldn't stomach it when it first came out br br i'm from the old school where the 1967 spider man cartoon was the best and still remains the best i won't get into the psychedelic version which is terrible give me traditional villains please br br the acting in the new stuff is lousy read off a sheet with either no feeling or overacting paul soles where are you now this guy was the best at voice acting for spider man no one comes close watching secret wars a great idea for a cartoon mini series made me wince dr doom sounds like a comedy version of bela lugosi in a scene with red skull and doc ock red skull has no german accent while ock is heavy russian the old marvel comic hero series from 1966 had much better voice acting iron man sounded like he was wearing an iron mask captain america sounded authoritative not like some teenage kid paul frees as the thing in the 60s was the best thing ever the old voice actors were pioneers and there will never be anyone like them ever hear mel blanc's son no way can he replicate his dad br br the animation is clunky okay so they have all the fancy character shadings and nicely painted backrounds sometimes you can say more with less movement if more movement looks bad sometimes when you let the computer take over the movements they become robotic i really don't think any of these animators know what in betweeners are br br the stories are badly written and some of the lines they give the heroes are horrible why for example when heroes are teamed together for the first time they start fighting with each other in secret wars it was a lame excuse that got them in disagreement i can see if the hero was dark unknown and mysterious like the punisher but why the thing and iron man can't hold their tempers with each other is ridiculous then the torch joins in this is just another of the later comic trends to get heroes to square off at each other for a few seconds because 'everyone' wants to see that stuff give them a better reason to fight and maybe it can be pulled off but hey what are you doing here and you don't tell me what to do are lame reasons another badly written scene is in the wedding where harry osborne unmasks himself to spoil peter's wedding that whole scenario was awful br br last but certainly not least is what another critic calls juvenile violence meaning no punches at all in secret wars the lizard carefully ducked the thing's charge but the thing punches the bad guys across an entire block in the comics he must simply revert to lifting heavy things and subduing a bad guy by grabbing hold of him in the cartoons sure these cartoons were not made strictly for us adults but for kids under 12 that's why they can't have punching because mommy and daddy don't believe in that type of violence but you can blow things up these cartoons will include that as a kid before political correctness came in fashion i saw cartoons punching each other what's wrong with a punch to the chops is there really less violence in the world today because those slick and crafty new cartoons took out the punch i find this the most insulting of all when i watch the new stuff they've written out the punch' because we could all hurt ourselves br br kids enjoy these cartoons all you want i've seen enough br br 3 10 rating
the stone boy is an almost forgotten drama from the 1980s considering how many famous or soon to be famous people are in the film one wonders how it could have been so overlooked this is a slow moody but touching account of a tragedy that befalls a farm family the film is more or less an indictment of midwestern stoic values and suppression of emotion the film will not be for all tastes but anyone who can appreciate real human drama should like it ok br br in the early moments of the film we see two brothers head off in the early morning hours to pick some peas and maybe shoot a duck or two if they're lucky while climbing through a barbed wire fence the gun accidentally discharges and the younger boy fatally shoots his older brother these boys have apparently never taken a hunter safety course the way for two men to properly go through a fence like this with one gun would be as follows first man climbs through second man then passes him the gun through the fence the first man then sets the gun down and helps the other through the fence at no time should either man have his hands on both the gun and the fence br br anyway once his brother is killed 12 yr old arnold regresses into his own world he does not even run for help after his brother is shot he simply goes ahead and picks the peas and tells his family about the accident later at no point during the funeral or inquest does arnold seem to show any regret or sorrow at all his family seems to shun him perhaps they are even angry at him for killing his brother an ornery uncle played by frederick forrest is outwardly upset with arnold even though the older brother's death allows him to hit on the kid's girlfriend arnold's parents don't seem to understand how to deal with their son they really don't even try to talk to him about the only person he can communicate with is his grandfather who is played in typical grandfatherly skill by wilford brimley after a while arnold even moves in with the old timer br br nothing seems to get arnold to open up until he takes a bizarre road trip to reno nevada to inexplicably look up his uncle's ex wife once he meets her he begins to emerge from his shell after apologizing to her for breaking up her marriage by starting all of the family's turmoil with the accident from here on the film becomes a quick study in reconciliation and reawakening br br the acting is hauntingly distant in most cases robert duvall and glenn close make the perfect stoic farm parents forrest is good but maybe trying too hard to channel paul newman's performance in hud the cinematography is exceptional too if you like moody pictures about common folk this one may be for you some even may be advised to bring some tissues 8 of 10 stars br br the hound
this ludicrous film offers the standard 1970's hippie mentality in a nut shell and bores us in the process its an attempt to rationalize absurd marriages of young innocent women with old age sex fiends and wash ups a naive young hippy played by the waif like kay lenz hitch hikes and sleeps with all the wrong guys and then one day she meets the ridiculous holden already in old age hard liquor drinking and washed up as an actor and she decides that she is in love with him if you think that is superficial the whole film encapsulates such scenes she keeps saying how much she loves him and she only met him it wears thin and really quick i couldn't help but laugh throughout the film its obvious she's just using him as a meal ticket but the director is immature enough to think we are going to buy that there is actually any love taking place a disgusting scene is where the two are naked and having sex i had to fast forward it because it almost inspired me to vomit a corny offering of music from the 70's is also spread through the film avoid this if you can grade d
this film was basically velvet goldmine if the writers of party of five got a hold of it and made it a t v movie the film lacks what velvet goldmine had which was good acting writing and basically everything else the film had some of the worst writing i've seen since wild wild west it definitely needed to be interesting i know vh 1 has become a household name for their behind the music shows which are a lot better than all this which would have worked if it was a behind the music episode but didn't and feel flat on it's face
it's hard for me to assign the fair number of stars to this film but i settled on 8 because of its high production values and what was in 1968 an innovative approach to the war film remember too that i haven't seen it since 1969 but it did make a strong impression br br the long day's dying must be one of the most vivid antiwar films ever made it achieves this simply by portraying in extremely realistic terms the actions of a handful of soldiers in northwestern europe in 1944 45 no film before this one showed war at the infantry squad level with so much brutal detail and all in a coldly dispassionate way that lets the actions speak for themselves there is no preaching no sentimentality no comic relief no complicated scenarios br br unfortunately there's no subtlety either partly because of their situation trying to stay alive the characters come across as flat familiar cliché's as entertainment the film doesn't make it though it was clearly not intended to entertain it was intended to slug you over the head with the misery and horror of world war ii and modern war in general this was twenty years before platoon and thirty before saving private ryan both of which are far more watchable films here the flat and generally disagreeable characters the lack of an actual plot and the realistically unpleasant images including what may be the first on screen vomit in theatrical history make the film hard to sit through though it is only 95 minutes br br so 10 stars for production and realism 4 stars for the feeling you'll have when it's over a bonus star for having its heart in the right place average 8 br br like carl foreman's underrated the victors an equally downbeat but more interesting and thought provoking film the long day's dying seems not to be on dvd why not both films have been on cable a number of times
after playing a nymphomaniac in written on the wind dorothy malone finally said good bye to her sweet sister wife roles and demonstrated an ability to play mantraps with the best of them she and gloria grahame played the same sort of tramps and for her efforts here in a very manipulative role malone won a best supporting actress oscar br br the film she's in is not quite up to oscar standards but it is a strong enough melodrama under douglas sirk's capable hands there's an almost noirish look to the explosive opening scene and it sets the tone for the rest of the sudsy fireworks in a story that has rock hudson lauren bacall robert stack and dorothy malone as its headliners br br domestic squabbles among the inhabitants of a wealthy family with an oil background are the primary focus of the drama with the accent on the strong supporting players stack and malone both of them seize the opportunity with both hands and stack too should have been awarded for his sterling job as the weak alcoholic brother driven to desperation by his own wild motives br br the nominal stars have less impressive work to do but do it with their usual skill and conviction hudson and bacall they play their more sympathetic roles with quiet authority and understanding br br the use of color is particularly striking as it usually is in a sirk film and yet it doesn't preclude me from thinking of the film as a technicolor film noir in the vein of leave her to heaven br br well worth watching with some interesting performances from the entire cast
fantastic movie one to excite all 5 senses is not a true historical report and not all information is to be taken as factual information true hollywood conventions used like playing a list and very attractive actors as the 'heroes' such as naomi watts julia cook ned kelly's lover heath ledger ned and orlando bloom joe byrne ned's right hand man and unattractive sorry geoffrey rush actors play the drunken and corrupt victorian police force this also instills a very unreliable love story into the mix between ned ledger and julia cook watts to entice all the romantics females being especially susceptible even from the first scene when ned saves the fat youth from drowning and his dad calls him sunshine and had a glint in his eye as he looked down at me his hand on me shoulder it is very romanticized and persuades viewers to side with ned kelly the underdog besides don't all aussies love an underdog
really i think this movie is more an example of an easy target than a truly bad film in fact the movie is done very well in many respects and is very entertaining br br yes the script is a little convoluted but that's the genre the film has a noirish atmosphere centered around a femme fatale just like all the old noir classics this too has a screenplay that twists you around so that you don't always know how to make sense of it at first and it can be a stretch if you think too deeply and try to put all of the pieces together that's the genre in general the script has enough surprises and turns to keep the viewer guessing and in turn surprised without abandoning the viewer br br sharon stone is also an easy target the truth is she looks great and she speaks her double entendre laden dialog in such a way as to zhuzh it up into something mysterious sexy and fun br br the direction is more than passable because let's face it you have to keep an audience interested in the did she or didn't she question for two hours in addition to a twisty script and a fun performance by stone this is done effectively through the direction by the creation of a noirish atmosphere that is both dark and very stark and modern at the same time with straight industrial lines to go along with stone's sexy curves the frame is always beautiful press pause anywhere and there is something interesting to the eye br br the film also effectively builds on things that were gimmicks in the first film and turns them into something a little more real particularly the sex katherine tramell is bisexual how shocking becomes treated more matter of factly here and typically the sexuality of the film is used to better effect it is still titillating but not done so readily for shock value and buzz as done in the first i won't say that it isn't still somewhat of a gimmick because let's face it this film is supposed to be fun br br and a fun film it is it may be an easy target but if you watch it for what it is a noirish femme fatale driven twisty sexy did she or didn't she who dunnit you're bound to enjoy it no pun intended
this obscure de sica delivers the goods and it is said the meek shall inherit the earth this tale of classes on the surface but really an allegory for all the homeless people that populated europe after the great war they are homeless but cheerful in a societies too impoverished and selfish to care for or acknowledge them footmats for the italian carpetbaggers de sica chooses to tell it as a fairy tale a cinderella story i have not read the book it is based on so i cannot foresay if the deus ex machina is the construct of the writer or vittorio it begins with the words once upon a time to exemplify the timelessness of its tale for the story could be set anywhere and everywhere caricature sketches of the aristocracy that cut to the bone whimsical nature of the homeless especially when they begin to grant their wishes and an ending right out of a spielberg picture makes this boulange a delight for all de sica's most accessible picture is also one of his best abandoning neo realism he always dallied between that and pure good old film making he creates a movie that breaks the heart and at the same time fills it with the yearning of hope that one needs to continue leaving in this world gracias vittorio gracias gracias gracias
i am a member of a canoeing club and i can tell you the truth that deliverance is synonomous with the peacefulness and tranquility of the experience as we put our boats into the water banjoes echo in the back of the conscious mind this movie is timeless because it waxes philosophical of human's place in nature and technology's effect upon man's relationship with nature we see it in the bow fishing we see it in the home made tent there is also city man's disdain and feeling of superiority to the rural woodsman cracker the fact that the banker from atlanta ned beatty has bad teeth is meant to put him on the same level with the woodsmen who also have bad teeth ultimately the struggle of life and death supersedes civilized man's suppositives about the law this canoe trip ends too soon for the viewer but alas not soon enough for the characters
warning may contain spoilers which will be more entertaining than this tripe br br heres some good advise to anyone living in the u k whenever channel 5 has an old 80's comedy on late at night read a book instead i am currently in the process of recovering from a seizure due to reading some of the comments on this film on here i am actually shocked at the fact that someone actually said this film was realistic all i can say is thank god the cold war never escalated or else we might as well have given the commie's our borders i found this film dire in the utmost pretence maybe it is just my british perception of what makes a film funny who knows but in all aspects this film is not just awful its teeth grindingly terrible br br i've never been a fan of bill murray and its rubbish like this that justify my feelings towards him don't get me wrong i loved ghostbuster's which was made only three years after this film but this just sums bill murray up really i can safely say that i haven't wasted my time so blatantly like this since seeing the first running of operation delta force over here though these two films have more in common than you would think for 1 thing they both have terrible action sequences from beginning to end and 2nd they are both riddled with cheesy cliché's throughout br br heres one thing these guys are supposed to be in the u s army yet they are allowed to wallow around their camp willy nilly seducing female military police officers and subsequently shagging them silly in the generals quarters talk about random this film is just terrible for this i'm afraid now don't get me wrong i'm no feminist sympathiser but the fact that these two women actually fall hands over heels in love with the two characters shortly after arresting them letting them go free twice is just insulting to the female race the fact that one tatty haired fat lipped bum winger and his hapless sidekick ramis can simply sweet talk themselves into into the mp's underwear to which they fall madly in love with the two of them is nothing short of ludicrous br br then there is the training scenes where you get to meet the squad phycho who unconvincingly threatens to kill anyone who touches him or his stuff followed by the overweight bloke played by the late and great john candy who claims he joined the army to avoid paying 400 for anger management classes leading to loud mouthed murray paying tribute to the giant toe wtf 'drill seargent' who honestly couldn't organise a pi up in a brewery let alone his band of recruits all this scene serves to do is to prelude loads of fight scenes with people saying way to go ass hole' all the time etc etc br br the scenes then carry on showing the rag tag bunch making utter tits of themselves on the assault course leading to a scene where one of them shoots wildly into the air at some passing birds with an assault rifle peppering a watch tower with bullets just like that yep told you this film was random he miraculously escapes undisciplined as well eventually leading up the the passing out parade where the hapless squad make a magic turn around within the space of two hours bugger me miracle thanks to some wise words from murray to which they then direct a massively none military like dance routine in front of a geriatric 'general' in front of the rest of the squads all of this to the immense pleasure of their two girlfriends on the stand who really should've been arresting them everyone laughs it off though this bit is nothing short of amazing though he then chooses them to guard a new multi million dollar prototype armoured vehicle in italy which turns out to be just a mobile home painted green with loads of gadgets on the inside claiming this is exactly what this army needs righto br br then there is the dire finale where murray and ramis decide to steal this top secret prototype military vehicle to pick up their newly acquired and somewhat hyperactive mp girlfriends in germany to which the hapless captain john larroquette then finds out and leads the squad of fresh recruits on a retrieval mission for this vehicle to which they then take a wrong turn en route and end up in soviet held czechoslovakia where they are captured like we didn't see that coming thus begins a rescue attempt by ramis and murray birds in hand to which is where a big fight loads of shooting from the hip and blowing tanks up with them coming back as national heroes humiliating the russians by calling them pussies etc etc the end thats right no courts martial nothing they only just stole a prototype military vehicle drove it into a warsaw pact country and almost caused an international incident which could've sparked ww3 br br this film is honestly more fun that being diagnosed with a terminal illness i know its meant to be a comedy it got all the right actors for it but where in the hell is it have channel 5 cuts those bits out the only redeeming feature in this film is the repetitive use of naked women taking showers and female mud wrestling like i said random not that it helps to divert from the fact that this is an utterly crap film of course this film should realistically be aimed at immature 9 year old's sadly we have to watch it instead 1 star out of 10 total tripe my advice do something a little more useful with your time like castrating yourself
audiences back in 1936 must have been stunned at what they were watching a full fledged beautiful full length technicolor film i can't say for sure but this might have been the first one 3 strip at any rate it still looks beautiful over 70 years later on dvd in fact just how good it looks is amazing br br kudos for that have to go out to director richard boleslowski director of photography virgil miller selznick international pictures and for the dvd mgm home entertainment all of them combined to give us one of the best looking films of the classic era age br br i thought the story was so so excellent in the first half stagnant in the second it gave a nice message in the end even though a lot of people might not have been happy with it i can't say more without spoiling things br br marlene dietrich never looked better i don't believe and certainly never played such a soft hearted character domini enfilden heart throb charles boyer was the male star and domini's object of affection but some of the minor characters were the most interesting to me people like joseph schildkraut as batouch john carradine as the sand diviner the most memorable to me at least was the dancer irena played by tilly losch wow there is a face and a dance you won't soon forget i've never seen anything like it in the thousands of films i've viewed just seeing her do her thing was worth the price of the dvd looking at her imdb resume she was only in four movies but they were all well known films br br basil rathbone the actor who really became famous for playing sherlock holmes also is in here as is c aubrey smith another famous british actor of his day schildkraut by the way will be recognized by classic film buffs as the man who played the arrogant sales clerk in the big hit the shop around the corner with jimmy stewart and margaret sullivan br br the beautiful direction photography and color and tilly's dance are the things i'll remember best about this movie which is a lot of good and not so good things all rolled into one had the last half hour been better although i admire the ending i would have rated it even higher it's definitely one film collectors want to add to their collection
this film in my opinion is despite it's flaws which i maintain are few an utter masterpiece and a great and glorious piece of art br br what mr bakshi has done here is to create an utterly beautiful film and has shown his immense talent and versatility as a director of animated films he does not receive 1 100th of the credit he deserves for literally saving the art of animation for an adult audience if it were not for mr bakshi i don't believe animation would have survived the disney onslaught what is more with the lord of the rings he has not only created a beautiful animated film but he has created an entirely new art form unfortunately one that never quite made it off the ground br br most people will complain about the use of rotoscoping in the film the use of live action images which are used as background images and often animated over using various techniques from what appears to be small amounts of tinting to full blown animation but i feel that the people who complain about it simply cannot accept an art form which is out of the norm no this is not disney animation no it's not live action no it's not cheating what it is is a new fascinating and absolutely wonderful art form something so fresh and so new that it feels completely at home in such a fantastic tale as the lord of the rings bakshi's pioneering use of this technique brings the subtleties of middle earth to life is a very dark and mysterious way in particular the darker of tolkien's creatures particularly the nazgul are realized in a way that traditional animation or live action have not been able to accomplish br br peter s beagle's screenplay based very little as i understand it on an early draft by chris conkling is a very loyal adaptation of tolkien's works where possible he uses dialogue directly out of the novel and it feels at home in the world which bakshi has created there are many cuts that were made to fit the first book and 3 4 into a single 2 hour 15 minute film but there are very few changes to the storyline there are a few holes which it would have been nice to have filled the reforging of narsil the gifts of galadriel the huorns at the battle of the hornburg but again with the time limitations he had already the longest animated feature in history these are certainly understandable though it makes one wonder how they could have been explained in a sequel br br also there is the delightful one of my favorites score by leonard rosenman who also scored barry lyndon and star trek iv the score for which is clearly based on his lotr work it is bombastic and audacious and dare i say perfect it stands on it's own as an orchestral triumph but when coupled with the images of the film it enters a whole new world of symphonic perfection so far from the typical hollywoodland fare that it turns many people off br br the voice actors are wonderful of particular note is john hurt as aragorn who just oozes the essence of strider br br the character design is also wonderfully unique though not often to everyone's taste but remember that it is the duty of the director of an adaptation to show you what he she imagines not what you might have imagined and so aragorn is realized with a distinctive native american feel and boromir appears in viking inspired garb this is perhaps not what you imagined but i can only applaud mr bakshi for showing us what he saw it also might be noted that he spent a significant amount of time with priscilla tolkien in developing the character outfits for the film br br one farther word the flight to the ford sequence in my opinion is one of the most subtlety beautiful sequences ever to be caught on celluloid bakshi is not afraid to slow down the pace for a moment and his mastery is clearly shown by the incredible tension is able to build bakshi's artistic ability and tolkien's incredible work fuse in this sequence to a glorious peak which has yet to be equaled br br the recent dvd release 2001 by warner brothers is sorely lacking while we can offer our eternal thanks that the film is finally available in widescreen format the package is woefully short of extras how glorious it would have been to have had a director's commentary been able to see the 20 minutes of extra footage that were removed for the theatrical release another delightful addition could have been the assembled the live action footage which was later animated over also present in the dvd release is the utterly horrible voiceover at the end of the film which is a departure from the simple voiceover which occurred in the very final frames of the film this version is plastered and poorly rendered right over the musical climax of the score br br of course the greatest tragedy of all is that the sequel was never made we will never be able to see bakshi's interpretation of gondor of shelob of faramir of the cracks of doom of eowyn's battle with the witch king or gandalf's confrontation with him we will never be graced with bakshi's image of denethor or the palatir or the paths of the dead it is a shame beyond all shames that we will in the end have to accept peter jackson's glitz and glitter hollywood action film version of these later events in tolkien's masterpiece but i suppose even that is better than having no cinematic version at all br br david
while not as wild and way out as some of takashi miike's later films this is a very good crime drama br br the basic story is the story of a cop of japanese cop with chinese parents trying to take down an up and coming chinese mobster complicating things is that his younger brother is acting as the lawyer for the villain and his gang the film is actually much more complicated than that with several complications which both keep things interesting and distract things from the central narrative thrust its this complication and loss of way about an hour into the film that makes this less than a great film it is a very very good one this is definitely worth seeing especially if you don't mind a no frantic pace br br a word of warning the violence when it happens is explosive and nasty there are also semi graphic depictions of gay sex if thats not your cup of tea proceed with caution br br 7 or 8 out of 10

an mgm miniature short subject br br the editor of the cole county clarion must decide what is the real important news for his readers an impending frost which may spell disaster to their crops or the sensational shooting down of a notorious gangster on their small town main street br br this is an enjoyable little one reeler featuring a good performance by comic charles chic' sale today's viewers will perhaps be more interested in the appearance of uncredited james stewart as sale's nephew assistant slow talking somewhat goofy stewart shows many of the attributes which would make him a huge star in a very short time br br often overlooked or neglected today the one and two reel short subjects were useful to the studios as important training grounds for new or burgeoning talents both in front behind the camera the dynamics for creating a successful short subject was completely different from that of a feature length film something like writing a topnotch short story rather than a novel economical to produce in terms of both budget schedule and capable of portraying a wide range of material short subjects were the perfect complement to the studios' feature films
i should say at the outset there are many many things i love about 'forbidden planet' and yes i certainly consider it a 'classic' science fiction film for many reasons but the adulation it has received over the years goes a bit over the top in my opinion no less an authority than leonard maltin says 'forbidden planet' is one of the most ambitious and intelligent movies of its genre ambitious without a doubt intelligent depends on what part of the film you're talking about it certainly was the most prestigious and highly budgeted science fiction flick to that point at a cost of nearly 2 million this was 1956 remember mgm pulled out all the stops to produce a dazzling eye popping outer space adventure unlike anything seen on the big screen before even employing artists from the disney studio for some of the more elaborate special effects 'charming' is not usually a word used to describe special effects in sci fi movies yet that is the one that seems most appropriate here even the dreaded 'monster from the id' is only a well rendered cartoon figure by the disney people unlikely to frighten anyone over the age of 8 when i see the various sets and take note of the art design models costumes etc i am reminded of nothing so much as 'the wizard of oz ' with its gorgeously saturated colors and elaborate if not always convincing effects so much work has gone into these films that one is inclined to smile in admiration at the effort regardless 'forbidden planet' is wonderful to look at the scenes take place on obvious stage sets that are fabulously decorated matte paintings of planets and space in the background and intricately designed miniature sand dunes and so forth to give the illusion of depth it's a bit like watching the most elaborately produced stage play you'd ever see the most believable and convincing scenes are probably the ones inside the massive krell complex where shots showing the vast depth and width of this inner space are well done and credible but then we get to the actors darn it the performances are almost uniformly awful though in fairness one has to say the dialogue hardly ever transcends the level of adolescent locker room humor except for some passages of barely adequate scientific technobabble even the great actor walter pidgeon is reduced to giving such a hammy performance it's lugubrious at times a very young leslie nielsen stars as the spaceship commander j j adams and doesn't convey an ounce of believability or conviction in the entire film he seems to instinctively know thirty years ahead of time that his true forte' lay in comedy as there are times he seems barely able to keep a straight face reciting his lines every forced reaction whether it is anger or passion or solemn meditation looks right out of a high school play anne francis also very young fares a little better as the supposedly innocent alta whom we are to believe has never seen a human male other than her father until the crew of the spaceship shows up alta morbius now there's a name for you unfortunately even at this early age anne francis seems about as virginal and naive as elizabeth taylor in 'butterfield 8 ' there is a good story here buried somewhere beneath the crew mates' leering comments about alta and yet another juvenile subplot concerning earl holliman's 'cookie ' ship's cook holliman turns in a horrendous performance too i'm guessing all these actors went straight from this movie to acting school based on shakespeare's 'the tempest ' the story of a dead race the krell and the fantastic world of machines they left behind is what most people tend to remember about 'forbidden planet ' and for good reason for a few minutes here and there you can forget about the rest of the movie and be dazzled by the disney artists' conception of the krell underground complex is it enough to make up for the rest of the film's shortcomings you'll have to decide that on your own oh and of course there's robby the robot every 1950's ten year old's idea of what a robot should look and talk like he's funny in places so 'forbidden planet' to me is a very very mixed bag it deserves credit for being the inspiration for a whole wave of sci fi films and tv shows that followed not least of which was 'star trek ' but i would suggest that anyone who thinks it's more than well staged comic book sci fi go back and watch it again
a charming romantic comedy the plot is a little too complicated i tried to summarize it three times and i can't suffice to say it's worth seeing the movie is funny beautiful the plot is totally unrealistic but it works everybody in the movie is so nice and everything looks so great it creates a sweet romantic feel through the entire film br br the acting is great robert downey jr and cybill shepherd are in top form and enjoying every second of it ryan o'neal and mary stuart masterson are just ok but fine if you're a sucker for good sweet sentimental films like me catch this one also downey looks great in his underwear br br extra bonuses the title song sung by johnny mathis and another great song after all sung by cher and peter cetera
oh dear while chevy chase and the gang at snl set new highs with the sketch show format this fails miserably at every level fortunately chevy is barely in this at all and can't be blamed for this utter tripe it seriously is very very bad while meant to be a political comment on usa at the time of it's release 1974 it still remains neither funny or acutely observed the sketches are all way too long and any satirical impact they may have had is lost as they're all drawn out to the point of complete boredom this is credited as chevy's movie debut and i'm pleased to say that everything he did after this bettered it avoid even if curious
i got a copy from the writer of this movie on soulseek i have to say it is pathetic and just plain painful to watch the two cops act but i watched the movie as a joke and since it is a homage to august's underground which i happened to have seen it is in my book as an awesome movie its quality and everything about it is pretty bad but its entertaining and something to talk about amongst your friends reminds me of troma but good stuff i recommend seeing this under two conditions if you are bored and need a good laugh or high otherwise just let it be recommended download for sure o and the killings are pretty funny like when the zombie rips the satan worshipers dick off and stabs someone in the head with it
quite simply this shouldn't have been made it's predictable and clichéd the on screen chemistry which made the first my girl so captivating is nowhere to be found here and the acting as a whole is stilted and forced the writing also leaves much to be desired some of the 'memorable' lines such as earpeircing a barbaric custom are just shocking where my girl provoked a genuine feelings of sadness and some genuinely funny moments like so many sequels my girl 2 tries to recreate these emotions generated by the audience and fails miserably maybe i'm being hard on this film because of how great the first one was but quite honestly it insults the quality of the original with the sort of drivel this installment serves up surely this has to come close to son of the mask as being one of the worst sequels of all time in both cases the old saying rings true if it ain't broke don't fix it
caught this film in about 1990 on video by chance and without knowing what i was in for many horror fans may have missed this thinking it was a typical prison film and the ones who did get it didn't like it as it was not what they wanted to see the above mentioned factors are probably the reasons it is low rated but just ignore that and give it a whirl if you're a fan of the genre br br it has strong suits in all departments from script and atmosphere to acting and the prison itself br br an absolute diamond a film i still have on video to this day check it out
men of honor true story about a proud and persistent black navy diver fabulous cuba gooding jr is definitely a great movie that both touches and entertains and it's part of the absolute cream of the new millennium cinema wonderful acting is the main reason to make this movie something truly special and pretty enjoyable splendid experience charismatic robert de niro is marvelous as rough fierce and pitiless chief billy sunday role is practically written for him this film alongside with fantastic 15 minutes 2001 are two of the latest proofs that he's still one of the very finest actors of our time on the other hand men of honor includes a fine performance from cuba gooding jr who has been one of the most promising young black actors since boyz n the hood men of honor goes straight into the company of jerry maguire as good as it gets and instinct cuba gooding jr is a skillful and fantastic actor and i'm prepared to get lots of more terrific movies from him men of honor has also quite an excellent story line and probably the most exciting diving sequences of the movie history this is a great fascinating movie and i can only recommend it
we saw this on the shelf at the local video store saw coppola in the credits and got excited that was the one and only time this movie raised any interest i could never quite work out if it was an attempt at a humourous film that failed miserably or an attempt at a serious film that failed miserably in general the entire production seemed incredibly amatuerish the sound in particular was absolutely dreadful especially in the scenes shot in the little bar the dialogue was so corny in parts it was unbelievable very disappointing
this star studded british spanish co production looks great what you can see of it i have three versions two vhs one dvd and all are terribly cropped so badly that it looks as if buildings are having conversations with each other few films suffer as badly from pan and scan as this one as director robert parrish seems to have been so enamored with the widescreen process that he tended to use both sides of the screen at once neglecting the middle another user comments that we see the entire inhabitants of a church massacred at the beginning not in any of the copies i have there are some abrupt cuts of peasants firing their rifles one mexican officer is shot shaw and landau celebrating and that's it we never find out why shaw has become a priest if he really is we never find out what happens to don carlos savalas although i suspect he was called home to star in kojak as his departure seems arbitrary and there is a strange flashback sequence where michael craig mysterious island is dancing around in a bowler hat and bad suit in the great old english music hall tradition to the 1960 hit battle of new orleans not sung by johnny horton here but with some lyrics i've never heard before on the plus side the location is great a huge old ruined fortress with escher style stairs leading nowhere some nice scenery chewing by robert shaw and good performances by stevens landau lettieri and telly savalas as telly savalas i didn't really like this film but i haven't exactly seen it i will seek the widescreen version and make my decision then
rather than move linearly from beginning to end this story line of a gay couple impacted by aids orbits in time around their perfect day the film is organized as a life remembered in asynchronous fragments rather than in a sequential flow as one directly experienced br br the narration has its lyrical moments particularly in describing the impact of loss anticipated or experienced the dialog unfortunately lacks such grace the script frequently compels the actors to say startlingly stupid or insensitive things that seem utterly out of character at the moment on their second accidental encounter clearly smitten with each other sensitive phillip encourages a reluctant guy to tell him about his difficult week but the moment guy begins to open up phillip an english major blurts out you're not a crisis fairy are you later watching his lover's naked chiseled body stride across the bedroom toward him our young shakespeare in love begins to render the beauty of the moment in words the way you cut through space i can't even describe it but lacks the verbal skills to complete his thought this kind of drivel continues through the aids hospice scenes bejeweled with lines like what made me think death would be all neat and tied up with ribbons and you make florence nightingale look like nurse ratchet br br the film often suffers from a bruising lack of subtlety unlikable characters are far more jarring and steamroller flattened than they need to be phillip's thoroughly annoying friends an arrogant trust fund brat and a whining needy dweeb maintain a running caustic diatribe about every one crossing their path such patter could offer a writer a wealth of opportunities for clever social commentary but sadly their remarks are merely unpleasant ungraced by wit or insight it's hard to know if our scriptwriter intentionally crafted intellectually limited characters or if he was simply running his tether's perimeter br br the plot may be what most appeals to and resonates with those who praise this film it does seriously explore 1980's us middle class gay life first encounters courting coupling nesting the complexity of open relationships friction and fracturing dissolution physical abuse rapprochement forgiveness terminal illness death and survival leads phelan and spirtas give fair to good performances rendering complex characters over time their fetching good looks help explain both the chemistry that held these two together through insensitivity and selfishness as well as the chemistry that helped some some viewers overlook this film's painful weaknesses the decision to chop the plot arc into tidbits and present them in out of sequence flashbacks added complexity without any evident dramatic utility and in several cases left the sequence and thus the implications of a given event unclear br br could i recommend the film to sticklers for literary and technical quality absolutely not for easy going viewers in serious need of an aids survivor catharsis or in the mood for a guilty pleasure tearjerker with a little eye candy thrown in maybe but better written alternatives exploring the impact of aids on relationships of that era include philadelphia and the band played on longtime companion angels in america an early frost parting glances love valour compassion and even jeffrey
james stewart and margaret sullavan play co workers in a budapest gift shop who don't really like each other not knowing they're really sweetheart pen pals who have yet to meet br br a very charming romantic comedy very engagingly played by it's two likable stars and a very eager to please supporting cast the story is well written and the film has that romantic innocence don't quite know how to explain it that films today just don't have this can obviously be compared to the recent you've got mail and the original wins in every way br br this is mandatory viewing each christmas i can't think of a better way to jumpstart a christmas feel than this little gem
this was an excellent idea and the scenery was beautiful but that's where it ends it seemed like a lackluster set it off meets the west the plot barely made any sense there were so many characters and not enough time to develop their personalities there were too may unnecessary things going on that didn't pertain to the plot nor did it help further the story along there were also long blank moments where the plot could have been explored but was used for silence or unnecessary conversations the script should have made more sense as well as the directing i had a huge question mark on my head watching this movie but the casting was great in my opinion if you're only watching for eye candy then this is the movie for you
absolutely the worst film yet by burton who seems to be getting worse with each film he directs a miserable script loaded with cliches is only the first of many objectionable aspects to this film this is the kind of movie where every time something happens you'll be sure to hear someone shout out he's lost his gun or whatever it is to let everybody know carter is really awful and so is wahlberg who can't play this straight and be convincing very nice effects and photography but poor music in the john williams mold by burton's crony elfman heston appears in a nonsensichal scene to spout out his most famous catch phrases from the first movie very poor results br br if anyone else out there also saw sleepy hollow they will probably have noticed as i have the declining quality of burton's films i've heard that this particular project was produced by others and that burton was brought in as director in which case his judgement should be questioned but i think he has allowed any possible vision he might have had earlier in his career to slip the evidence is there in the films in sleepy hollow he couldn't decide what kind of movie he was making whether it was a comedy or a real horror movie and the population of british character actors chris lee etc made you also think it was kind of a monster rally film those are never scary as horror fans know the movie couldn't succeed on either horror or comedy because it was so schizophrenic and no style had been developed to smooth the two together planet of the apes is much the same way and the result comes off more like total recall or tango and cash than like sci fi he's also fallen into the rut of so many other big directors of trying to satisfy the entire possible audience word to burton if you're out there pick something and do it straight or use some style to peice it all together as in mars attacks or beetlejuice or you might as well retire because people like me that are fans of your movies will stop going
the subject is certainly compelling a group of people take their love of gaming one step further by creating a fake medieval world full of warriors kings princes and castles wargaming is an interesting phenomena that delves into our collective need to escape from reality and the sometimes mundaneness of our existence something almost everyone can relate to the characters are the predictable mix of lord of the rings nerds and star trek enthusiasts that's enough to get most people to watch however very quickly the film turns into an insider's view of wargaming with an almost stereotypical thumbing of the nose to viewers who don't get it the filmmakers seem to take the subject of wargaming and this particular one waaaaay too seriously rather than once in awhile recognizing the humor and fun in making a film about adults drssing up in medieval gear and pounding each other with foam swords it's pretty hard for anyone who doesn't sit on their computer for 7 10 hours a day playing games or desiging the latest star destroyer to understand what the characters are talking about and why we should even care however the filmmakers themselves seem not to care choosing to focus solely on the subject of the game itself rather than building a strong narrative with a clear story that anyone can understand moreover the characters themselves are not that compelling and you quickly become bored of them a big no no when you're trying to keep people's attention for 90 minutes
there is something in most of us especially guys that admires some really working class small town real men populist fare and sean penn serves it up for us with a cherry on top hey a lot of people use penn as a political whipping boy but i don't rate movies or actor directors based on politics or personality that is what right wing commentators like excretable faux movie reviewer debbie schlussel does while acknowledging he is one of our best actors and a good director i think this picture was a simplistic piece of aimless dreck that he has atoned for since br br okay you have the gist of this there is this good cop a small town trooper joe played against type by david morse who in the opening scene chases some guy on a country farm road in big sixties cars the bad guy stops gets out shoots at him so joe has to blast him dead there was no explanation what drove this man to do such a desperate violent thing and the dead man's parents do some redneck freak out at the police station while joe feels real sad and guilty that he had to kill someone so we know that joe the farmer forced off his land into a cop job is a good basic sort of guy then his brother frank shows up he is a sadistic amoral bully fresh out of the army and nam where the war got his blood lust up some people here and in other reviews called him just an irresponsible hell raising younger brother and sean was trying to make some point about what our john wayne tough guy culture and war does to otherwise good people but what i saw was an amoral sadistic bully who enjoys hurting and ripping people off then there is mom and dad marsha mason and charles bronson who do the requisite turn as old fashioned country couple then die off she by illness and he by shotgun suicide to advance the story for us both times frank the bad guy is away being a miserable sob but good joe brings him back to podunksville from jail so frank can straighten his life out by welding bridges and living with his utterly stupid screaming trashy pregnant wife but joe has a nice wife played by italian actress valeria golina who is mexican and sean uses this as an exercise in some affirmative action embellishment of goody joe and his real soulfulness underneath his uniform and crew cut for me that was an utterly pointless affirmative action subplot that sean uses to burnish his tough guy creds by sucking up to mexicans because mexicans are so tough and cool br br but frank is bad and we get the requisite events like stealing friend's car robbing gas station by beating the clerk over the head then torching the car and all those cool things that hell raisers do then there are the mandatory 8mm film childhood flashbacks of young joey dutifully moving the lawn and cowboy dressed franky jumping on his back and wrestling him and yadda yadda so we all know what deep bond there is between the two of them br br so the film meanders around with a lot of small town schlock to warm the heart of any red stater accompanying the film was a great soundtrack of good sixties songs like jefferson airplane and janis joplin which were totally inappropriate except for the 60's era effect to win the hearts of old hippies the worst offense is that since the movie was inspired by a springsteen song the highway patrolman that song was not included br br so joe's brain dead wife goes into labor and joe runs off to the bar to get loaded and spout some populists drunken victim's spiel about how tough things are while good joey comes to drag him back to his wife the bartender is good ole ceasar played by dennis hopper so viggo frank whigs out for no particular reason and beats his pal ceasar to death after good joe the cop leaves br br so joe has chase his bad brother down and i was so hoping that he would do the right thing and blow that menace to society away instead we get a scene where his brother stops ahead of him in some old 50's junker on some lonely road at night and little franky in his cowboy suit and cap guns gets out of the car to face good joe the kid from the 8mm flashback home movie sequence oy such dreck then to top off this drecky sap fest there is some zen crap about the indian runner who is a messenger becomes the message ala marshall macluhen see what i mean sean has done much better than this so don't be afraid to miss this one
despite or perhaps in part because of the clever use of music to underscore the motivations and ideologies of each of the major characters stereotypes are in and verisimilitude and characterization are out in this not too subtle cinematic screed br br one gets the sense that john singleton was dabbling in post structuralist literary theory because it was the flavor of the day and higher learning was the tendentious result the low point of the movie is the peace rally in which the symbols of the 1960s free love movement are reappropriated for what much more closely resembles a take back the night rally with live stridently identity conscious musical acts in tow perhaps in his prim revisionism the director was trying to assert that identity politics is the new vietnam ooh how adrienne rich of himand remy's firing into the crowd is a nice touch if you're into rich's sort of political posturing br br i wish i could give this movie negative stars i can recommend it only to those interested in the 1990s as history a time when radical feminists brought the academic trinity of race class and gender to popular culture and declared man hating a viable and honorable political option where's camille paglia when you need her
maybe it wasn't that good as a whole but the second episode which was the first one i say was so memorable i still remember it today i became a fan of dick francis i would recommend it if you are interested in horse racing and mysteries br br the cockney slang of the sidekick chico barnes is a lot more amusing to those of us who have never been close to hearing london's bow bells but the leads are attractive and the shows were interesting br br sid halley was one of francis' more interesting characters and the show actually minimizes some of the difficulties with his hand interestingly electronic hands of the sort used in the stories are apparently less functional for the user than the sort invented after world war ii
i saw this movie when i was in israel for the summer my hebrew is not fluent so the subtitles were very useful i didn't feel lost at any point in the movie you tend to get used to subtitles after about 5 minutes br br this movie blew me away it depicts two of the most prominent taboos in the middle east today a homosexual relationship between an israeli and a palestinian it allows a person to enter both realms of the conflict simultaneously the dilemma the emotions entailed the movie climaxes in tragedy when anger and rage drive one of the lovers to one extremist side an absolute must see
it's not often i feel compelled to give negative criticism of a film after all i often feel the maxim if you don't have anything good to say don't say it at all would be apt advice for the many naysayers we listen to everyday who nitpick at things we like if it's all the same to you the reader though i feel compelled to point out that with the lone exception of christopher walken in a returning role as gabriel this movie is pathetically horrid i say this to you to warn you in advance that even if you are a fan of walken's deadpan delivery and style or liked the original prophecy that you will be sorely dissapointed if you buy it return it if you rent it make sure it's only ninety nine cents br br what's wrong with this movie a full list would take too long to read and would bore you to tears but a short summary would be the following the once rather crystalline clear picture of the relationship between angels and mortals of the first film is ripped to shreds gabriel is turned from the rather morbid right hand of god he once was and in this role he is wickedly funny in the first to little more than a thug for heaven since walken is so good at playing heavies we all remember frank white from king of new york he is still enjoyable but the supporting cast is an unmitigated and unconvincing mess of mortals and angels alike who couldn't buy a clue for 50 cents if you can figure out the plot you're a smarter man than i one gets the feeling we wander aimlessly from scene to scene just to move the film along to walken's next big line by the end of the movie you're actually wishing he'd blow his horn and make the walls of jericho fall on the people who made this un natural disaster br br bottom line it's an insult to our intelligence that they made a sequel to this film in the first place the original told the right story answered the questions that should have been and left alone the ones you were meant to ponder afterwards there are no compelling reasons to follow these characters that was in the first the priest who lost his faith the little girl who kept the big secret the teacher who protected her children even lucifer himself was more interesting by himself in the first film than all the other characters in the sequel put together i feel sorry for anybody who sees this film and not the first because they'll probably never want to watch the original and that's a real tragedy
surreal film noir released soon after the real genre defining classics the maltese falcon double indemnity and the postman always rings twice welles films shouldn't be evaluated against others he was playing by different rules in fact he was playing this starts where other femme fatale films leave off so the vaguely logical but interesting whodunit is embellished with a display of wellesian scenes typical rapid fire style dialog lots of hard boiled philosophy and unusual acting good hayworth presumably intentionally one dimensional to welles genre may have meant formula but he seemed to like using mysteries as backgrounds for his entertainments
whoever wrote the script for this movie does not deserve to work in hollywood at all not even live there and those actors need to find another job the most dreadful hour and some minutes of my life and i only kept watching to see if it would get better which unfortunately for me it did not br br even at the end the credits gave me anxiety i guess there weren't a lot of people behind the movie so they had to roll the credits slowly very slowly br br this movie is definitely a great how not to make a movie guide too bad i can't give a 0
i had heard some not too good things about this movie and had probably seen the low score here at imdb and that's why i had avoided it today they showed vanilla sky on tv and as i had nothing better to do and as it turned out i would have had a hard time finding anything better to do vanilla sky is a frightening sad and touching movie actually one of the best i've seen in a while i was surprised by how i was affected watching it it's hard to explain but during the movie your feelings towards the characters and your perception of what is going on changes and it's quite an emotional journey vanilla sky really touched me in a way that is very rare for a movie or any media for that matter br br i really recommend everyone to watch this movie regardless of what you have heard about it
i gave this a 1 there are so many plot twists that you can never be sure to root for total mayhem everyone gets killed or nearly so i am tired of cross hairs and changing views i cannot give the plot away convoluted and insane if i had paid to see this i would demand my money back i wish reviews were more honest
an actor's first film is usually something one can afford to miss it's often that first job where the lack of film experience by everyone involved is truly on display and this film is no exception br br but worse than that even by 1982 standards this is so bad it's hysterically funny filmed entirely in the chicago area on an obviously small budget most of the acting by the entire cast is stiff wooden and cartoonish a cross between a high school play and bad community theater noise from nearby traffic often drowns out the dialog and the dialog is truly bad very declarative in a way that comes off as forced and expedient rather than natural and organic scenes are contrived and choppy and even though the characters go through a span of years neither the children nor the adults age at all br br i do believe it's possible to make a christian film that's palatable to a large secular audience but too often the creators of such films are so focused on 'the message' or in this case their own autobiographical ties to the project that good film production values are tossed aside i'm sure it's no coincidence that the main character has the same name as the producer director editor and cast member br br luckily michael madsen was much more interesting and believable to watch in his subsequent films careers like his are certainly not built on films like this one
jean marc barr being light the big blue dogville has directed and interpreted this strange movie which is the second installment of some kind of trilogy i might be wrong but i don't think this movie's part of the dogma '95 manifesto though it really looks like it i'm not really sure of what i think about this film all actors are good they deliver pretty good performances especially rosanna arquette and jean marc barr the story is somehow interesting but i don't know there's something about the movie that i don't like the sex scenes are way too long it goes from an interesting work of art to an erotic piece of crap i don't know exactly where it stands sure it's not a bad movie but i won't suggest people to see it neither i'll tell them not to watch just do as you want if you feel curious and you're open minded give it a try you might like it
spoilers on of the first wwii movies coming out of hollywood that shows how the war effected those gi's or in this case us marines who fought in it br br 21 year old al schmid john garfield was just starting to live with a well paying job earning some 40 00 a week at the local steel mill and girl ruth hartley elenore parker whom he was about to marry when the japs spoiled everything for him and millions of likewise young americans by attacking the us pacific fleet at pearl harbor doing his duty as an american citizen al immediately joined the us marine corps hoping to get back at the japs knowing correctly as it was to turn out that the marines would be the first american combat units to get a crack at them br br al finally got his chance when his unit the 1st marine division landed on august 7 1942 at guadalcanal in the far flung solomon islands to engage the japanese who were were in control of it it was during the battle of the ilu river that al almost single handed stopped a massive japanese banzai attack holding off with his machine gun wave after wave of suicide attacks by the determined japs until help or reinforcements finally arrived it was during the bloody fighting al was hit in the face by a jap grenade that ended up blinding him br br now back in the states convalescing at a naval hospital al is faced with something far more harder to overcome then battling a battalion size attack of japanese or german soldiers he's faced with a future where he'll never see again and having to depend on others to look after or for him br br we get to see in the film pride of the marines al battle himself far harder then he did the japanese troops on guadalcanal in just coming to terms with his disability not wanting anyone especially his girlfriend ruth to feel sorry for him al in fact is the one who feels sorry for himself more then anyone else in the movie it's with the help of navy nurse virginia pfeiffer rosemary decamp and ruth together with his us marine buddy lee diamond dane clark that in the end gives al the courage to face his blindness with the same strength that he faced wave after wave of japanese troops on gudalcanal a courage al thought he lost back in that god forsaken island hell in the south pacific br br based on the true story of us marine sergeant albert schmid pride of the marines showed what we were to expect from the tens of thousands of wounded us servicemen coming back from the war we get to see how it in many ways was far more difficult for those fighting the war to adjust to a peacetime america when they left something like in the case of al schmid behind on the battlefield al's battle with his personal demons was a lot harder then the japanese that he fought in that they were part of him and thus had to fight himself in order to overcome and eventually defeat them despite the help that he got from both nurse virginia and his girlfriend ruth as well as his navy doctor who has a striking resemblance to actor gregory peck it still was up to al to overcome the fears that he faced fears which he and only he had to both battle and overcome like he was told by everyone in the movie all by himself
the dentist was made on the time when almost every profession had it's psycho we had mad police officers ambulance men secretery's and that was just for starters the dentist came suprisingly late because going to dentist is usually everyman's nightmare br br the plot is twisted super clean dentist doctor feinstone lives perfect life in his great white house he has beautiful blond wife and great place to work as a dentist dark clouds are coming to his horizon in the form of nasty irs guy terminator's earl boen dirty pool cleaner cleaning his wife and suddenly everyone's teeth seems to have gone through dark filter he goes nutso and starts to take care of people teeth in the nasty way and you don't want to come to his path br br crew were professional producer director brian yuzna had produced stylish horror movies like re animator and from beyond he directed the sequel to re animator and his first movie society was nice spinoff from john carpenter's they live film's producer pierre david is known from movies like scanners cast was great corbin bernsen really suprised me i knew him from la law and major league but i could newer dream him as a psycho dentist he was actually great in his role and he was kind of sad person linda hoffman was beutiful and dumb as feinstones wife micahel stadvec did not have much line's but after i saw him with ladies of the neighbourhood i knew my future profession ken foree dawn of the dead from beyond was nice sight as cop on the case virginya keehne was the innocent teen who is about to be next client to feinstone br br final warning if you're like me and have problem with dentist's then maybe you should skip this one but if you want to try than you should prepare yourself with dark humor and lots nasty drillings
i have seen many many films from china and hong kong this is the worst no the worst one was 'unknown pleasures' i watched 'platform' yesterday evening and thought that jia zhang ke's other two films must be better this evening i was disappointed again i will not be watching 'xiao wu' tomorrow evening because i have just placed all three films in the bin whoever gave this film 'platform' ten out of ten needs to watch more cinema the photography was very poor it was very difficult to differentiate between some of the characters because of the lack of close up work the storyline was so disjointed that i fast forwarded it towards the end out of pure frustration i would not recommend this film to anyone give me zhang yimou or chen kage any day these are true masters of chinese cinema not pretentious con men
okay so i've seen a lot of really odd unusual movies in my day fear and loathing in las vegas comes to mind when i think of that well not anymore from here on out whenever someone asks me hey what's the most unusual movie you've ever seen slipstream is what i'll say and i do not mean unusual in a good way br br from the very beginning of the movie it was obvious that this was going to be one of those trippy camera effect movies by that i mean little things like flashing images on the screen rewinding and fast forwarding people's words and scenes messing with the color on the screen flash forwards and flash backs constantly then you have the actual acting itself people randomly get violent shoot things people say the weirdest things that just don't make much if any sense br br the movie is about a writer who starts to intermingle real life with the book he's writing and for a lack of a better way to explain it you basically see this trip he goes on throughout the movie the thing is johnny depp went on a similar trip in fear and loathing in las vegas but the only difference is that his trip was entertaining to watch not painful honestly i had a real hard time even finishing slipstream it kind of hurt my brain a bit br br i can see some film buff making a claim as to this movie having certain cinematic nuances that make it not only unique but add to the feeling of dementia blah blah blah point is this movie hurts your brain when you watch it it makes very little sense it takes all of your concentration to even remotely try and understand what is going on and even at the end the only thing you can be happy about is that it's over and you can say you actually sat through it so in closing if you want to see a movie that will have you saying what the heck over and over again both out loud and in your head go ahead and waste an hour and 30 minutes and check this out br br mr hopkins while i applaud you as an actor and commend your choice to take a stab at directing please do not ever make a movie like this again next time try something that relies a little more on great storytelling than camera techniques that tend to leave the viewer with a headache
this is john waters best film to date the characters are obvious and symbolic just as in his other films so there are no surprises or character changes i enjoyed the film because of the wittiness and pace of the story it was good story telling with honest people
man was i disappointed br br 1 adam arkin is more whiny than ross geller from 'friends' br br 2 a great cast is wasted kenneth mars alan arkin ed mcmahon pat morita louis nye with this amateurish script br br 3 the movie suffers from horrible pacing it jumps around through in a jumbled confusing manner br br 4 the story doesn't even make sense why does he want to break the football streak what about the stupid violin music none of it is explained br br 5 it's not even funny it's like a bunch of accountants trying to do improv saying lookit me lookit me i'm being funny this was a bad attempt at making another love at first bite br br i like larry cohen movies but man he failed here i couldn't wait for the credits to roll horribly disappointed
an absurdly hilarious and strikingly human tale of the jealousies and infidelities surrounding a beetle marriage russian animation pioneer wladyslaw starewicz's mest kinematograficheskogo operatora the cameraman's revenge or the revenge of a kinematograph cameraman is a delight of early animation brimming with highly effective stop motion puppetry and no shortage of imagination br br mr and mrs beetle have a completely uneventful marriage and both yearn for more excitement in their lives mr beetle's desires can only be satisfied by the beautiful exotic dancer at the gay dragonfly night club whom he visits whenever he takes a business trip to the city she is the only one who understands him a fellow admirer of this dancer an aggressive grasshopper is jealous that mr beetle has stolen his lady and as fate would have it he is also a movie cameraman the devious grasshopper follows mr beetle and his acquaintance to a hotel room where he films their exploits through the keyhole br br meanwhile mrs beetle has likewise acquired a friend to add excitement to her life he is an artist and he brings her a painting for a present before they both settle down on the couch for some intimacy at that moment however mr beetle returns home and witnesses the entire spectacle as mr beetle bashes through the front door the artist friend clambers up the chimney but he doesn't escape without mr beetle first venting his anger and frustration upon him br br there is a certain irony in the statement that follows mr beetle is generous he forgives his wife and takes her to a movie he is generous enough to forgive her and yet he had been equally unfaithful just minutes earlier at this point in time however we still haven't forgotten the jealous movie cameraman who had been plotting his revenge and it is no surprise when he turns out to be the projectionist for the film mr and mrs beetle are attending suddenly intercut into the film they are enjoying is the footage of mr beetle's disloyalty and the angry wife hits him across the head with an umbrella before the frightened and angry husband dives through the theatre screen in search of the grasshopper br br in the final scene both mr and mrs beetle now somewhat more appreciative of each other are serving time in prison for the fire that broke out when mr beetle sought his final revenge we do indeed hope that the home life of the beetles will be less exciting in the future this film may appear to be a mere story of the comings and goings of a miniscule insect species but starewicz is communicating so much more than that this isn't a story about beetles  it is a story about us and it's startlingly accurate isn't it
this sci fi masterpiece has too many flaws after the editors had butchered it after its opening in 1936 visually it is a wonder to behold but the script allows too many intellectual speeches about war and progress this gets very corny when the actors are given to recite a lot of high minded messages at all times raymond massey and cedric hardwicke both great actors come off as quite a pair of fanatics ralph richardson is very good as the the boss a megalomaniac warlord the prediction of world war ii was very eerie considering that the world was on the brink of the most devastating conflict in human history at the time i'm sure glad that war didn't turn out as it did in the movie there are some visually stunning montage sequences bridging the leaps of time between the movie's different episodes although its not as entertaining as i hoped it would be this movie sticks in your mind long after you've seen it
the saddest part of this is the fact that these are 87 minutes i'll never get back i knew this was terrible from the get go with the guy dressed as a lunatic indian chief on top of the roof see if they could get away with that in 2008 my 10 year old boy is really into baseball right now so we decided to rent it on a rainy day even though he seemed to enjoy parts of it i had to cringe when i heard all the needless foul language bad bad movie this was an awful ripoff of bad news bears completely shameless and completely predictable i don't mind a predictable movie if it's done well but this one absolutely was not
soldier isn't a great movie and everyone that hated it has plenty of good reasons but i liked soldier alot partly because my expectations were so low that what i saw surprised me br br first the art direction is tight and well executed as far as science fiction backdrops go soldier was doing things with more design then 90 the genre the sets costumes and props were all consistent and competently executed i didn't love all of their future military style but i was impressed with the effort for me this made the movie worth the time it took to watch br br second i'm a kurt russell fan i grew up watching this guy in some of the most memorable movies of my youth the barefoot executive and his john carpenter films soldier is essentially an action movie and the role of sergeant todd is an essential action hero it's not an award winning role but kurt musters up convincing emotion with very little dialog br br third the fight scenes and battles are well choreographed this isn't iron monkey or even the matrix but once again it far exceeds the average level of quality in the genre br br if you haven't seen it and you like sci fi action films pick it up if you pass at your rental depot of choice just don't expect the next bladerunner
don't let the name of this film deceive you in reality jake speed the character is quite possibly the laziest action hero ever known to film when jake speed is not saving virgin girls from evil madmen which he is often not he's seriously relaxing perhaps this adds to his charm but in my opinion an action hero is not suppose to chill out whenever he gets the chance furthermore unlike other daring heros who usually have an impressive list of talents this man has none unless of course you call sleeping a talent anyhow this movie is basically worthless the writing is sub par and the action when there is some is very lame the machine guns on the jeep weren't bad but that's about it so if you're in the mood to watch a movie that is a cure for insomnia then this piece is perfect for you it has a hero that not only puts himself to sleep but also his audience
the legendary boris karloff ended his illustrious career by making four cheapie fright flick clunkers in mexico this is the token moody period gothic horror entry from the bunch karloff gives a typically spry and dignified performance as matthias morteval an elderly eccentric patriarch who invites several of his petty greedy and backbiting no count relatives to his creepy rundown castle for the reading of a will pretty soon the hateful guests are getting bumped off by lethal life sized toy people who populate the place onetime mexican sex symbol andres garcia of tintorera infamy portrays the dashing police officer hero and julissa looks absolutely ravishing as the sole likable female character the clunky plodding non direction trite by the numbers script ugly washed out cinematography ridiculous murder set pieces a gross fat slob gets blasted right in the face by a miniature cannon overwrought string score morbid gloom doom atmosphere largely lousy acting karloff notably excepted cheesy mild gore poor dubbing and rousing fiery conclusion all lend this enjoyably awful lemon a certain endearingly cruddy and hence oddly amusing ratty charm a real campy hoot
i just rented this today heard lots of good reviews beforehand wow what a pile of steaming poo this movie is does anyone know the address of the director so i can get my five dollars back finally someone bumped stop loss from the 'worst iraq war movie ever' number one spot to be fair i don't think there are any good iraq war movies anyway but this was really bad br br i won't get into any technical inaccuracies there's a hundred reviews from other gwot vets that detail them all if the director bothered to consult even the lowliest e nothing about technical accuracy however they could've made the movie somewhat realistic maybe i guess the writer should be given the credit for this waste of a film he or she obviously hatched the plot for this movie from some vivid imagination not afflicted with the restraints of reality does anybody but me wonder what the point of this movie was was there a message seriously though wtf br br i'm pretty amazed at all the positive reviews really this film is hard to watch as a vet because of all the glaring inaccuracies but even if one could overlook that the plot sucks characters are shallow to say the least and the acting is poor at best it's ironic i suppose that this movie is supposed to be about explosive ordinance disposal because it's the biggest bomb i've seen this year
rock solid giallo from a master filmmaker of the genre sergio martino fashioned from a marvelous screenplay by ernesto gestaldi this shocking mystery often develops fascinating twists until the terrific finale which most might not see coming throughout the film it's when everything has fallen into place that we can go ahh the film revolves around the death of a husband in an airplane explosion and the million dollars the wife receives from it there are those with great interest in that money one in particular being the dead man's mistress the wife is lisa ida galli and the mistress demanding half the money is lara janine reynaud she tells lisa she knows that the death was arranged by her to get the insurance money lara says she'll use her lawyer sharif luis barboo to get that money so already the film produces two possible suspects in the later murder of lisa who awaiting someone in tokyo george hilton portrays peter lynch peter works for a company that investigates those who gain inheritance to see if the pay day was gathered under suspicious means when on his watch lisa is killed by a man dressed from head to toe in black in her hotel room he is a possible suspect he decides to do a little investigating himself while also assisting inspector stavros luigi pistilli and interpol agent benton tom felleghy on their quest to find a killer the killer strikes several times eliminating anyone revolving around the missing million dollars confiscated by the one responsible for the murder of lisa soon the film follows a journalist cléo dupont the delicious luscious anita strindberg as she and peter meet for a dinner where she could try and sniff out anything that might break a story for her soon they fall deeply in love but it seems like anyone who is near peter is killed soon someone attacks cléo with an intent to kill which pushes the investigation further into uncharted territory why would anyone wish to harm a journalist with no real facts to damage the one killing off people br br this giallo is quite clever and exciting to follow the film never lulls which is quite remarkable since so much happens leaving open the question of the identity of the killer this film follows the path of gialli with knife slashings because of a certain pattern the killer has taken the throat and lower torso the film's conclusion wraps up all the complex loose ends and is quite satisfying the film has some unique camera angles but delivers the goods in terms of driving the plot and the execution of the mystery
now i hired this movie because brad dourif was in it he is an excellent actor brilliant in everything except this movie and i think that was only because he realized how stupid this movie was and didn't bother with a good performance this movie is a unintentional comedy some of the lines just crack me up and them there are some lines that make no sense and it seems like tobe hooper just throw lines in without thinking about the plot oh btw the plot is bad but it one of those films that is taht bad that its actually painful to watch i recommend this only for big brad dourif fans or fans of any of the other actors because the plot is pathetic
david chase's the sopranos is perhaps the most over praised television show in recent memory not only is the series devoid of intellect and passion it's devoid of a soul as anyone reading likely knows already james gandolfini is tony soprano a big fat a hole of a mob boss with a spoiled b tch of a wife and two bratty sh t brained kids living in you guessed it the armpit of america that's new jersey by the way not only is tony a womanizing adulterer he's also an unrepentant murdering scumbag with a crew of saturday night live skit worthy caricatures for subordinates it's not the fact that tony is a piece of sh t mobster that offends me and apparently only me allowing characters to be who and what they are without judgment is something american tv hardly allows but chase and his entourage of money gorged emmy gored writers have not simply allowed us to observe tony and his crew as they behave nor have they even attempted to provide any insight into the action reaction reality of even obviously fictionalized organized crime a la the godfather instead chase glorifies and endorses his characters' greedy violent and corrupt lifestyle in the same way that tony his wife and even his hair brained psychologist do week after week or should i say month after month or is it year after year it seems like the show's paltry 13 episode seasons come out with the same regularity as a lunar eclipse much has been made of the series' refusal to adhere to network structure with plot lines that go nowhere and characters that pop up and disappear like backyard vermin but if the show is so brilliant in its lack of structure why does it always feel like i'm watching a soap opera tired mob clichés bored housewives self serving irredeemable characters and plots that go nowhere more than ever i can see why so many americans of italian heritage are p ssed at this show it's enough to make you want to curl up with a good book danté's inferno springs to mind br br people on imdb love to claim that there's nothing good on television and therefore the sopranos is a breath of fresh air are these same people too busy paying their cable bills to watch the shield it's included in basic ya know how about the still good the west wing or the brilliantly acted if erratically written boston legal what about possibly the best comedy of the last few decades arrested development and lest we forget that we live in an age of dvds nobody has to watch anything new i'd much rather shell out 40 for an over priced boxed set of well pretty much anything than give hbo 10 a month or 80 a dvd set to continue to prove how much of a hack factory it can be br br you want good television watch homicide life on the street or murder one or picket fences or even chase's prior show northern exposure if you're already among the sopranos 's legion of brain washed fans and critics it's too late for you but if not leave tony and his worthless kin where they all belong rotting with the fishes sleeping would be way too kind
i saw this movie the other night i can't even begin to express how much this movie sucked the writing the voice acting even the claymation terrible terrible terrible it's like watching 24 hours of c span for the sake of comedy it just doesn't work it literally falls flat at about every spot possible br br also the movie's animation is very poor quality i know that this is an movie made by one person but to think that he could make 97 minutes worth of crap maybe he could at least make 1 second worth of funny br br this show may take the cake for being the worst film of all time yikes it really was that bad if you're looking for a movie that will make you laugh steer clear from this abomination my advice don't even buy it or look it up for that matter your brain will than you
i don't know what else to say about this horrible movie that hasn't already been said honestly i have only myself to be angry with i should have know better when i saw the title of this movie that it would be a horrible piece of crap but i loved war games so i indulged my whim i will live to regret that decision the rest of my life from the very start when the government people explained that their super computer could determine who a terrorist was just by how well they played a video game i knew i was in for a ride though the land that good writing forgot the list of very very very bad plot lines dialog and acting is so long i would crash imdb if i tried to post it to those people who said that they have seen worst movies than this one please tell me i am actually curious to see something that could top this steaming pile of horse dung
when this movie was first shown on television i had high hopes that we would finally have a decent movie about world war i as experienced by american soldiers unfortunately this is not it br br it should have been a good movie about wwi even though it was made for television it is obvious that a real effort was made to use appropriate equipment and props but the writing and directing are badly lacking even though the makers of this movie obviously borrowed freely from quite a few well made war movies war movie clichés abound such as the arrogant general who apparently does not care a flip about the lives of his men when will hollywood realize that even though there have been plenty of bad generals most combat unit generals have seen plenty of combat themselves and are not naive about what the average grunt experiences the first part of this movie appeared to be paths of glory with american uniforms except that paths of glory was emotionally gripping later on there was chamberlain's charge except uphill from gettysburg and even the capture of the american soldier by a ring of enemy soldiers from the thin red line but in the thin red line the soldier was alone when captured in this movie a ring forms around the new prisoner in the middle of a battle br br if this movie used a military adviser they ignored him even though the actors and i never could forget they were actors while watching mouthed military tactics i didn't see very much of it the american soldiers would stand up to be shot while the germans attacked and the infamous storm troopers who were apparently blind appeared to use no tactics whatsoever in their attack in the real war the tactics were what made storm troopers so effective but the silliest scene was the attack of the german flamethrowers in this scene the german flamethrower operators walked in a broad line towards the defending americans if that had been real they would never have gotten close enough to use their flamethrowers before they had all been dropped by the defender's bullets br br okay so most war movies are unrealistic when it comes to the tactics shown but it is still disappointing but what really turned me off to this flick was the typical anti war anti military angle that movie makers seem to think is important true war is hell but most american soldiers even though they grumble and gripe tend to believe in what they are doing and can be rather gung ho about it my grandfather served in world war i and even though he died four years before i was born i have been told how proud he was of his service
i came into this movie really wanting to line it i thought the premise had a lot of potential and was ripe for an interesting movie don't get me wrong here i wasn't expecting citizen kane i was taking this for the b movie that it is that said it still fell short of the expectation the historical aspect of the story is glazed over and the ending left me a bit cold the acting in the movie was very wooden all in all i give it 4 for a great idea but the movie could have scored much higher with a bit more attention to movie making fundamentals is it worth seeing i didn't wish for my two hours back but i don't know that i'd recommend it to others
i was forced to see this because a i have an 11 year old girl and b we had shown her the bonita granville nacy drew movies from the 1930s which she thoroughly enjoyed personally i didn't think it was as humorous as the 1930s flicks but on the other hand it wasn't the nauseating piece of intelligence insulting fluff i feared it would be it was an inoffensive mildly entertaining movie although i'm pleased that they didn't try to upgrade nancy to 21st century hipness veronica mars holds the title as the modern nancy drew i do think that they made her a little too bland that they didn't do enough to develop nancy drew the movie could have been titled jane doe girl detective i have to blame the script i think each actor did a good job with what they had to work with i liked emma roberts in this role but they gave her a made for tv not theatrical release script
i'm so glad i happened to see this video at the store i was looking for some happy movies and this one turned out to be a true gem i loved that the movie a love story of sorts wasn't about some beautiful twenty somethings rather it's a story of some beautiful sixty somethings who used used to be twenty somethings it's a good well written and wonderfully acted story with fabulous wwii band music thrown in as well it's also got a delightful surprise in it for scottish castle lovers it left me smiling and ready to watch it again which i did a couple more times before i turned it in i highly recommend it
i guess i've seen worse films but that may be becuz i'm so jaded by how standard these bad horror movies are the killer monster thing is really really bad basically its a guy in some kind of green body suit there is much worse acting as far as b movie go but don't think for a second this was anything stellar hell no it actually did have a plot with substance but was still pretty stupid basically its just a bad low budget horror movie but at least its not as bad as titanic that movie sucks balls this one just sucks the blood looks really fake in this movie thats one complaint i have about all the horror of the new millinium low grade gore looks stupid a good gruesome death scene with really fake blood is so stupid at least there was a nice shower scene
first of all i became dissy after watching this movie for five minutes cause of the bas screenplay i don't think this movie has any purpose it's boring from the first minute to the last i don't understand why this movie scores so high i gave it 1 10 but actually it's not more wurth then 0 10
take br br 1 a famous play br br 2 a director with now ideas of his own who is using br br 3 a copy of the stage design of a popular theatre production of the play mentioned in 1 br br 4 an actor for the lead who has no feeling for the part he's playing and you'll get hamlet prinz von dänemark br br i listened to the radio play of hamlet with maximilian schell as hamlet and i was so disappointed i hoped that the filmed version would be better that schell would at least have a body language to underline what he's saying nothing then the set the minimalistic design is not everyone's taste but usually i like it when there's just enough on the stage to make clear what's the setting and nothing more alas that's on a stage in a theatre it won't work in a film based on a play that actually has believable settings that the idea for the set was copied from the theatre production in which schell played the hamlet already let's say if that was the only thing to complain about i ask myself how schell could get the part of hamlet anywhere in first place and how anybody could allow him to play hamlet a second time if you've got the choice to view any of the about sixty films based on hamlet don't watch this one unless you're a masochist or really hardcore or like to poke fun on untalented actors
jack london's life was certainly colorful enough for a dozen films about different aspects of him sad to say though that what his life was used for in film was some wartime propaganda that put the best face on some of the least attractive parts of his character br br jack london who barely saw the age of 40 when he died wrote some of the best stories around he wrote on what he knew but he also wrote as does everyone else bringing the baggage of his own life experience with him some of that experience in another day and time would have been condemned as racism but this was world war ii and london was a big believer in the 'yellow peril' as it was called back in the day br br two thirds of the film covers his life as author we see his years as a seaman from where he got the inspiration for the sea wolf we see him up in the yukon in a miner's cabin with a dog that was no doubt his inspiration for the call of the wild london was able to capture the spirit of adventure that his own life was all about right on paper for the world to enjoy ever since br br the final third dealt with his time as a war correspondent covering the russo japanese war london was a socialist but his socialism did not encompass folks who were oriental like a few million others he saw the rising immigration of the chinese and japanese to our pacific coast as a threat to jobs for the white people he advocated strict immigration policies for orientals br br the film puts the cart before the horse london is presented as a man who saw because he was on hand at the russo japanese war what japan's ambitions were and for that reason was as xenophobic as he was actually the kind of atrocities present in world war ii were not existent during the russo japanese conflict japan had her imperial ambitions but so did everyone else including the usa at that time but our immigration policies caused by pressure from our west coast politicians was a big contributing factor to the deterioration of relations with japan over a couple of generations london was part of the cause not a prophet crying in the wilderness br br this film was the first independent production of samuel bronston who later did some films with a bit more budget than jack london had he a bit more money bronston might have gotten james cagney or spencer tracy both who would have been right for the role instead they got michael o'shea who was making his second film after lady of burlesque o'shea is fine in the part but certainly was no box office br br as london is covering the war he meets up with a captain tanaka who is played by leonard strong an actor who specialized in orientals and played a ton of them in world war ii from the vantage point in 1905 strong outlines in the best fu manchu tradition japan's imperial aims right up to taking on the usa eventually must have gone over great with the swing shift crowd br br a lot of course is left out of london's life including a first wife playing the second and only wife in this film is susan hayward who only comes into the movie when it's half over i wish we'd have seen more of her charmian kittredge london survived her husband by almost 40 years dying in 1955 br br o'shea in fact met and married the leading lady of his life in jack london virginia mayo has a small role in jack london and they married for 30 years until o'shea died in 1973 br br maybe one day we'll get a view of jack london that will be a lot better than this one
producer joel schumacher who also directed phone booth '02 and many other great films showed in great detail how no one person can really be trained to be a killing machine with out destroying their own personalities and the real fears that a person has to face when going into combat colin farrell roland bozz intermission '03 gave one of his best performances and actually carried this entire picture on his back matthew davis jim paxton blue crush '02 gave a great supporting role and shea whigham pvt wilson all the real girls '03 showed his true acting skills in the role that he played there was two brief scenes where the soldiers were able to find some hot romance on a short leave in the local town and had to pay for their love and sexual desires one army veteran instructor from viet nam told the soldiers how to really torture the enemy by using electrical wires in all the wrong places on a human male body enjoyable and entertaining film to view
i only saw iphigenia once almost 30 years ago but it has haunted me since br br one sequence particularly stays in mind and could only have been fashioned by a great director as michael cacoyanis undoubtedly is br br the context the weight of history and a mighty army and fleet all lie on king agamemnon's shoulders an act of sacrilege has becalmed the seas endangering his great expedition to troy he is told he must sacrifice his daughter iphigenia to apollo in order to gain the winds for the sails of the thousand ships he initially resists but comes around and tricks his wife clytemenstra to bring their daughter to the greek camp in order to marry the greatest of all warriors achilles br br clytemnestra and iphigenia arrive find out about the sacrifice and rage to the gods for protection and vengeance meanwhile the proud achilles discovers that his name has been used in this fraudulent dishonorable way he climbs a hill to tell iphigenia that he will protect her br br the shot the camera circles the two young people without looking directly at each other they bemoan their fate and the weakness of men that deceive their loved ones and lust for war suddenly they gaze at each other and for one moment we feel both their power and beauty and the unstated except by the camera irony that in another time another place they perhaps could love each other and be married it is a sharp and sad epiphany that lasts only for an instant br br what direction what camera what storytelling
this movie is the second worst film that i have ever seen the first being ghost rider there is absolutely no plot climax conflict or any other major detail required in portraying a story this 'film' is basically just another excuse for toby keith to show off his manly side and the 'tough guy he really is' i completely wasted my time watching this film the best part would have to be the ending credits if i were ebert or roper i would have cut my thumbs off and thrown them at the producers whoever in their right mind gave toby keith the chance to act in a feature film is obviously on the same mental level as him in conclusion do not waste your time watching this movie it could quite possibly be the only thing you regret
i couldn't believe my eyes when i watched nuremberg yesterday on dutch television it starts very slowly the backgrounds of the nuremberg trials become clear step by step the germans have a funny english accent but then suddenly in the last few minutes of the first part of the series the audience gets to see the most shocking horrific footage i have ever seen br br it is important that people get to see such footage although i absolutely don't agree with people stating that there is no minimum age at which children can be exposed to this kind of material but in this film it was completely ridiculous it was purely meant to improve the impact of an ordinary tv series it was meant to shock the audience which is very cheap and unbelievably easy in stead of trying to move us with well done scenes inspiring dialogue or interesting viewpoint's the audience is being tortured with horrible images of skin and bones camp inmates it doesn't show any respect for the victims of the holocaust br br i'm very angry
cinematically this film stinks so does a lot of the acting but i br br don't care if there is a strong representation of what the 80's were br br like for a lot of us in the innercity anyways and what hip hop zulu br br nation and break dancing were really like great music great br br dancing it almost seems like a documentary of a time now past br br when hip hop was a way of life it's also interesting to see new br br york looking like ground zero from a nuclear attack some viewers br br may be too young to remember that it was a poor run down city br br during the 70's and 80's this is the best of all the hip hop break br br dancing movies that came out around that period of course the br br 80's are considered a joke now with all the bad tv shows and br br movies but those of us who lived through it will always remember br br it fondly for a time when music dancing and graffiti were fresh yo
the first half hour or so of this movie i liked the obvious budding romance between ingrid bergman and mel ferrer was cute to watch and i wanted to see the inevitable happen between them however once the action switched to the home of ingrid's fiancé it all completely fell apart instead of romance and charm we see some excruciatingly dopey parallel characters emerge who ruin the film the fiancé's boorish son and the military attaché's vying for the maid's attention looked stupid sort of like a subplot from an old love boat episode how the charm and elegance of the first portion of the film can give way to dopiness is beyond me this film is an obvious attempt by renoir to recapture the success he had with the rules of the game as the movie is very similar once the action switches to the country estate just as in the other film i was not a huge fan of the rules of the game but elena and her men had me appreciating the artistry and nuances of the original film
i can't believe i watched this expecting more it starts out ok this movie pushes the limits of reality way to far at least the first one was somewhat realistic it rips off the first movie and even mentions the joshua project anyone who knows anything about computers will hate this movie it does have one good message in it though watch out for big brother the movie just makes it seem like big brother is way bigger than he actually is in reality that was very aggravating even the make up on the actors was completely bad some of the acting is pretty good some of the acting is really bad though the script was ok at some points and completely messed up at other parts this movie plays on convenience about every five minutes like i said i can't believe i watched it expecting more i think i am gonna pop in the original to get back to earth q
cliffhanger is what appears to be slyvester stallone's last action movie before he became such an underrated actor it's about a mountain climber that must help his friend after being held hostage by mercenaries that want them to find three suitcases carrying money over 100 million dollars it has great action sequence's edge of your seat fun and a great time at the movies
babyface notorious barbara stanwyck flick where she is told by the local professor type that she has power he tries to get her to read nietzche she says books ain't never done her no good soon we find out her father is basically pimping her out to a local politico and others finally she has had enough and relocates to the big city we follow her trail of men up the ladder of success in an international bank the dialogue is quite saucy for it's time and it was one the last films to come out before the self inflicted hollywood production code look for a cameo by a young john wayne as one of stanwyck's willing victims part of the forbidden hollywood collection i watched the extended version the dvd has both versions plus red headed woman and waterloo bridge an interesting movie and foreshadowing for future femme fatale roles that stanwyck would play in the era of film noir b
i originally saw this film years ago during cinemax friday after dark series back when the cable box was built like a keyboard and it intrigued me even though there is a pointless aspect to the film it is well acted the performances of depardieu dewaere are very enjoyable they have a good chemistry together miou miou makes a pink fur look breathtaking a movie like this probably wouldn't be made in these politically correct times at least not in the us since it seems to sensationalize things like violence robbery casual sex this movie proves that with a talented cast also talented directing a good movie is a good movie no matter the subject it saddened me to find out patrick dewaere committed suicide in the near future i ll will check him out with depardieu miou miou in get out your hankerchief
i can't believe that in the 34 prior comments nobody mentioned that this film is a blatant rip off of born yesterday a man is hired to bring an ostensibly dumb blonde up to the requirements of a gangster hired gun and blonde fall in love and live happily ever after gangster is left in the lurch but born yesterday was an intelligent treatment whereas this is just so much fluff technicolor transfer to dvd is deplorable natalie kalmus would be rolling over in her grave check out the paperboy recognize him but it's historically interesting to see the roots of rock 'n roll also interesting is ewell's introduction to cinemascope a new format at the time
the thing that stands out in my mind in this film sadly is the introduction where john berlin andy garcia is driving into town you see his mercedes pass on a winding road through a forest that looks like its loaded with redwood trees it's quite beautiful br br as to andy garcia playing a character with the last name of berlin well andy is just too hispanic latin for it to be passable maybe a caucasian father married his spanish mother for this story who knows but i can tell you that when you put him in a town of farm folks and hicks he stands out like a sore thumb especially with his accent that flares up when he gets angry yeah i know big deal right he's still a good actor br br the title concerns a serial killer who nicknames his victims jennifer all of the victims are blind and he dismembers them the killer has taken a hiatus but suddenly resurfaces when a blind witness don't ask appears helena robertson uma thurman thurman does a good job of playing a blind person to my surprise when i saw lance henriksen playing sgt freddy ross i got worried henriksen's played in some pretty strange films especially of late i still can't forget him in the bloodbath movie pumpkinhead br br berlin movies into a small town from l a as a detective he begins investigating the jennifer murders after finding body parts in the local landfill his brilliance in discovering one of the victims was blind seemed far fetched so did the irony of spoiler freddy's murder with the recording and name similarities i got very confused as to the logic of how there came to be eight jennifers and the motive of the killer as simply deranged didn't pack much of a punch in retrospect this film is probably more true to life in showing an unsuspecting individual as capable of murder simply because they became a little wacko over time or maybe were born looney toons br br john malkovich does a stupendous job in his interrogation of garcia albeit no cop would legally be allowed to press someone that hard and egg them on without rightfully get knocked out as to the ending it is a bit of a surprise but is highly arguable much like sgt ross' murder the killer chooses to walk after his running victim opting instead to frolick i guess br br and there are so many opportunities he has in killing her that it's ridiculous i won't ruin the very end because despite it's shakiness it's a good surprise afterward though you'll probably say as i did boy was she lucky 4 10
this movie about two italian brothers who came to germany with their family is just great br br it isn't an idealistic movie i would say it shows life as it is or was in the 60s and 70s when the main story takes place the characters are very nice but have also some dark sides what makes you believe that these are real persons great movie with great actors to show that life is not funny all the time but that you can find happiness with fire and passion as the main character gigi would say
it is said that david lynch's films and shorts won't appeal to everyone neither will dumbland maybe more than ever i have a feeling that dumbland as people come across it will be a true mark of 'i get it' or 'what the hell' it's not surrealism exactly but absurd to the point of no return it's also very very very stupid but in this stupidity can be a sort of ironic intelligence to it that the maker knows so well how childish and repugnant this is and this self consciousness is a plus not a detraction br br it's just a bunch of crudely drawn shorts the kind that might not even make it on hertzfeldt and judge's animation show which i might add lynch here has a lot in common with both directors in their work centered on a lummox with an iq of 20 who has a constantly quivering with fear wife and a child who looks like a cross between the gingerbread man and or an alien the episodes include little situations like a faulty treadmill a salesman who can recite the gettysburg address watching over a sick brother in law ant hallucinations and just wallowing on the couch with noise all around all the while lynch is still experimenting as he was constantly for better or worse during the period of five years he made on and off inland empire br br for one thing he's going back to the roots of his very first short six figures getting sick six times in the usage of repetition as a means to an end this sometimes works excruciatingly well and sometimes not sometimes like with the episode with the sitting around the house doing nothing as teeth are bleeding and a fly buzzes around the absurdism sort of waxes and wanes without much of a good effect and even an episode like with the guy's friend coming over is funny more so for the beavis butt head comparison both laugh like idiots and are equally engrossed by killing things like fish and sheep what ends up working is how lynch shows up front delirious abstractions in the crudest ways imaginable and excessive violence br br in what comes closest to surrealism in ants the guy mistakenly sprays bug spray just called kill one of lynch's very cheap but fun pokes at societal conventions on himself and envisions ants in a musical chorus line solos included and one of the most harrowingly funny things i've ever seen from the filmmaker is get the stick where we just see the guy cheered on by his son getting a stick lodged in his mouth soon the neck breaks eyes pop out and once said stick is removed he doesn't watch out for traffic waddling like a manhole cover other moments pop up like this in unexpected crevices and it's drawn as if on cheap paper with an impetus to shock with foul mouthed language mostly from the man as well as from the 'grandmother' who in one of lynch's voices for the characters is the deepest of all and a shaky quality that's reminiscent of the cream of the crop from early hertzfeldt br br all the same i'm still not sure if dumbland is something i would put into someone's hands if they haven't seen much of lynch yet let alone anything by him there are some little points on society made via complete exaggerations that may or may not be in lynch's mind closer than we usually think to those in real life however in general there's not a whole lot that should be read into it which is why i'd say more than half who see it will hate it with a passion those who dig the bottom less pits of animated comedy be prepared have a blast
i had somewhat high hopes for this since i like tim roth i was not pleased with this film i liked the ang lee the hulk a few years back so i figured this would have more of a bang to it first i was very disappointed with john hurt's performance here he looks as if his eyebrows were re shaped for this his performance was not convincing he was not as good as one would expect tim roth is cool as always here the gama thing didn't really stick to the original story line i don't think i guess the best part of the film was the end it had some cool action the only problem with the original was that it was too long this one is not as long but it got a bit boring at times i remember some time ago when walmart had this movie really cheap for sale and i always wondered why now i know i was hoping to to get blown away but i was not
i hate over long over talky french movies but my favorite movie of all time is the longest and talkiest french movie of them all i saw it twice in the mid 70's and then it disappeared but i finally got to see it again in 1999 and fell in love all over again what is most remarkable is that it feels every bit as fresh today as it did 25 years ago if you haven't seen it don't miss your chance
i saw an early screening of this film in new york and i along with my friends and pretty much the entire audience were vastly disappointed the movie wasn't even so bad it was good it was as lifeless as a snake bite victim samual l jackson looked surprisingly tired through most of it and the snake effects were lame it reminded me of one of those cheesy scifi movies except the cheesiness of this movie was not funny or even campy it all seemed worn flat and overtly formulaic i'm shocked to say i actually think anaconda was more fun it's easy to understand that soap realizes it's a piece of s it and plays along with it but what the film fails to embark on is a script that has any scares of suspense it's the worst kind of lame movie it's joyless
br br i saw once no man's land 1987 imdb link http us imdb com title 0093638 and found it ok the film is about a guy who steals only porsches gone in sixty seconds comes 13 years after and adds nothing to it in fact it has a lot of scenes that are worthless and the ending is very very bad br br the sphinx has a magnetic screen presence that should have been better used
in this day and age of incredible special movie effects this one was a sore disappointment the actors seemed stiff and uninspired as was the dialogue westerns are not common fare for hollywood so much these days but movies like silverado prove that somebody out there still knows how to make a good one considering that it is hard to conceive that anyone would go to any expense at all in releasing much less creating such a weak film as this one if you love and are looking for a good western keep looking
as with all environmentally aware films from the 1970s soylent green has a rather cheesy view of what ecological meltdown is overpopulation means there s too many people to feed i was under the impression that famines were caused by either war or failed economic policies stalin s policy in the soviet union in the 1930s left millions dead because of famine and to this day the greatest man made tragedy was mao s rural policy in china which led over 30 million starvation deaths in the 1950s and let s not forget the great famines in the horn of africa in the 1980s and 90s which were to do with conflicts not overpopulation you might like to also consider that two of the most heavily populated areas on earth hong kong and macau have never suffered a famine in modern times likewise the expansion of shanty towns around cities as seen here isn t strictly down to overpopulation it s down to economic factors where people flock to cities to find better paid work than in the countryside it s a symptom of industrial progress not of too many births so the image of the streets of new york city being too congested to walk through and of having people sleep in stairwells is somewhat laughable br br but don t be fooled into thinking soylent green is a pile of corny tree hugging crap because i consider this to be the best ecological film of the br br 70s it plays on the contempary audience s knowledge of the world where sol and thorn are beside themselves with joy at finding fruit brandy and fresh meat thorn gasps in amazement at having ice in his whisky puffs on a cigarette and delivers the classic line if i could afford it i d smoke two maybe three of these a day but it s the visage of the euthanasia chamber that s memorable as thorn gazes at the images of wild animals flowers running water and snow covered mountains a world thorn s generation has never known this is a very haunting scene which makes soylent green a very memorable film combined with the fact it features the final screen appearance of edward g robinson as the wise old jew sol roth

if this is a 2008 product from one of the biggest production houses of indian film industry yash raj then i am afraid it is a very long ahead for us to reach the right standards br br if you can go wrong to this length with such an enormous star cast of anil akshay saif and kareena then movie making is still to be studied much harder by everyone associated with this film the film lacks in almost all departments except cinematography and akshay kumar he has a few good dialogues to render but that alone cannot make you enjoy a flick with huge expectations br br the first scene of a car going down into a river from the mountain has very cheap graphics like that of a cartoon film that itself was a clear indicator of the director's vision every actor who otherwise is an asset to a movie is simply wasted anil kapoor's gimmick of attempting good english falls flat most of the times and saif will surely hit himself thinking why he signed this movie br br in short it's the biggest waste of resourses after jhoom barabar jhoom i would say that even aaja nachle was a better enjoyable movie than this br br one cannot understand how and why this kind of script was written and approved the most unwanted was the flashback sequence of akshay's love story after the faulty script the weakest point of the movie is its music vishal shekhar have given just some filler tunes to each song the songs start off very well and suddenly the tunes drop drastically only one song falak tak chal is somehow good of all in the lot an opportunity wasted by vishal shekhar br br regarding the continuity intelligence of the makers just sample this akshay and saif are on the road in the hilly area of a foreign location probably ladakh in the next scene they are searching for kareena in haridwar and then back in the hills with kareena in the dicky of their car i am still thinking who wrote this br br if you manage to sit till the last then the climax is too long with silly and unnecessary stunts you can see all the heroes walking through the storm of bullets not hurt as if they are god are we still seeing a 2008 movie with all these technical heights achieved so no more words on this pathetic and downgrade movie but a sincere request to senior actors from their fan br br dear anil kapoor akshay kumar if possible please ask for a preview of your movies after their first copy is out as artists of such stature you have certain responsibilities towards your fans and viewers people still clap for you as you enter the screen in your first scenes respectively i think this kind of movie should not see the daylight as it hampers the reputation of all associated with the movie the actors and the production house both

there are two reasons why i did not give a 1 to this movie one reason are some of the actors like malcolm mcdowell and gwynyth walsh work who tried to play at their usually good level of acting however at many scenes they were somehow blocked by the bad scripting br br the other reason is the cool idea and looking of the cyborg which is quite different to most other such roles i've seen so far br br everything else in this movie is as bad as it can be boring scenes useless and boring dialogs bad script work and it seemed as it was the first movie ever for many actors it could have been an interesting story though but they failed completely
notice that all those that did not like and enjoy this film commented that it was not as good as the book or that it differed from the book br br i don't understand this type of criticism books and films are different media while books have hours and hours to develop characters and story lines films have about 120 minutes yet the film has the advantage of stimulating several senses visual audio as well as the imagination i don't care if a film is as good as or in fact has any resemblance to the book on which it is based who cares i judge it for what it is br br this tv movie was charming an old and oft seen story prone to cliché it could easily have been embarrassing however riffen and reeves pull it off one reviewer found riffen far to old i would never have guessed she was 40 when she made this film it is to her credit as an actress that she played a 23 24 year old amazingly well i also think it is about the best thing reeves ever did the story could have been stronger and i agree the screen play could have used tightening nonetheless it is well worth watching clearly not a powerful love story but rather a charming romance which will leave you satisfied that love is a strong emotion and good overcomes evil and it is nice to see a love story without the obligatory f word the naked buttocks or hours of spit swapping kissing br br lastly the musical score is excellent
this isn't a film it's a 111 minute evangelical christian sermon draped over red state america's 1 sport high school football another of the long earnest messages to the converted who are then presumed to be fired up enough by the spirit to go abroad and convert their unsaved neighbours br br dialogue like you won the big one when you accepted christ loses any possible camp appeal by the disturbing intensity in director coach alex kendrick's sunken black eyes then there are the parables br br two farmers prayed for rain but only one prepared his field to receive it which one do you think god blessed this rhetorical question is meant to foreshadow the miraculous climax in the course of which coach asks his trepidous back up kicker son do you think god could help you make that kick it's the kind of entertainment we could have expected would receive faith based funding ad infinitum if only the evangelical christian bush administration's hegemonic pursuits around the world had convinced us all to become devout after their example behold that poor giants coach in the apocalyptic finale urging his team on crying who's with me while the devout eagles on the other side were quietly going about doing the lord's work br br so do you think our terrified back up makes his kick to vanquish those self centrist goliaths well we all know zealots can't lose put it this way transfer the playing ground to the deserts of the middle east replace the christian proselytizing and this virulent nonsense can easily be repackaged as a taliban vs superpower parable which the devout worshippers of this garbage might want to think about a minute br br luckily they won't care nor need to like coach tells his team of earnest empty vessels pregame the answers are all right here in this book and the christian right will devour this on their way to their rapture that final victory they have prepared their fields for
if this movie had not been labeled a disney picture i probably would not have been so disappointed the nudity was unnecessary and did not add anything the same can be said for the toilet bowl scene this is one disney film that i will not let my four year old nephew watch
you know how everyone jokes about the acting in porno movies well if you've always found the plot line of a porn to captivate your interest then this movie is for you it truly was like a porn without the sex or if that analogy is not to your liking imagine you and your drunk roommate found a movie camera abandoned on a park bench this is the movie that you would make horrible acting bad camera work music done on a casio keyboard this movie has it all and more for those who are masochists in the crowd this is a premiere piece for your collection br br all i can figure is that the only people to submit reviews for this dripping pile of movie were people who 'starred' in it br br their movie career is over before it started
this prodigal son and eastern condors are my favourite sammo hung films the fat dragon is fatter in this outing than he was in condors but he's no less sure footed as director or actor he is in fact at the top of his form and delivers a devastating brutal actioner that boasts half a dozen amazing sequences and manages to tell a compassionate sweet love story also love and romance are not the director's priorities here but they serve as curious adjuncts to the action and insure that viewers don't hit the fast forward button between the physical clashes br br the opening scene which features a funny light sabre duel sets a solid but deceptive tone a sequence in which sammo's pedicab is chased by a car is beautifully staged and sweetened with a sharp comic tone the fast and furious stick fight between sammo and lau kar leung is a model of dazzling choreography and sharp superb direction and easily one of the best ever of its type the film's violence escalates slowly until finally when the climactic showdown comes we are subjected to some of the most brutal altercations ever seen in a sammo production the director actor's assault on billy chow and a house filled with angry menacing opponents is a bone cracking physically punishing delight br br terrific on every level and one of the best martial arts movies ever made br br great score too
david burton richard chamberlain quite good is a lawyer more adept at handling corporate taxation and suffers from unusual dreams which bother him seeing this aboriginal man shrouded in darkness who is called on to take a case concerning a group of aboriginals charged with the murder of one of their own named billy we see that he tries to steal stones with ritual painting on them and is killed when a leader of an aboriginal tribe named charlie nandjiwarra amagula uses a death bone to stop his heart meanwhile revolving around david bizarre weather patterns effect sydney such as rain beating down polluted dirt and rock sized hail during bright blue skies with no sights of clouds such as the one that hits a school in central australia not to mention a deformed rainbow which is split into groups as david pursues the case he finds that he is far closer to the weird events taking place than he could ever realize one aboriginal named chris david gulpilil appears to him in a dream holding a stone with blood and he finds that this man is one of those he is to represent at trial he finds that it's quite possible after some strange meetings with charlie and conversations with chris that he very well might be linked to a spirit named mulkurul and that his dreams are actual premonitions of possible horrors yet to come br br absorbing apocalyptic drama builds it's story methodically and is completely original and unpredictable with peter weir in charge the film is visually arresting as we see these very overwhelming images of possible doom towards civilization but the film's most compelling angle is certainly david's journey to find that monumental truth that plagues him as he questions charlie and chris countlessly at first to help his men get off from a crime they didn't commit and ultimately to find out what he has to do with anything catastrophic that is occurring or might occur later
to quote flik that was my reaction exactly wow you're perfect this is the best movie i think i can even say it's become my favorite movie ever even wow i tell you what wow

a lovely old fashioned thriller coming on like a cross between alfred hitchcock and david lynch red rock west follows the misadventures of injured veteran unemployed oil worker mr n cage as his luck turns from bad to worse after he ends up with an empty gas tank and barely enough money for a cup of coffee in a one ute town in the back of beyond it has been established right from the start that mr cage might be down but he is not out and he might be broke but he will not steal not even in his present dire circumstances consequently when he is mistaken by mr j t walsh for the man he has commissioned to murder his wife mr cage calls on the wife to warn her of her husband's intentions in turn she in the person of miss l f boyle offers him even more money to murder mr walsh mr cage decides to leave whilst he is still in front but as he is driving out of town he hits a man in the road tempted as he might be to drive on he takes the man to hospital where it turns out he has been shot mr cage is detained by the deputies who call the sheriff who turns out to be mr j t walsh events take a further complicated turn when escaping from custody mr cage narrowly avoids being run over by the real hit man on his way to fulfill his commission about now you might be forgiven for thinking enough already but as it happens on the screen it seems a completely logical turn of events the narrative flow of the movie at this point seeming unstoppable mr d hopper is comfortably cast as the hired killer like mr cage a usmc veteran this little piece of serendipity keeps mr cage alive long enough out think the murderous trio and survive a little more battered but still unbowed it is a tribute to everybody involved that what sounds on paper remarkably like a piece of nonsense is in fact a tense exceptionally well made picture with fine performances all round red rock west is a movie lover's movie within five minutes you know you are going somewhere you've been before on plenty of occasions but you'll be very happy during the trip
red rock west was far and away one of the best suspense thrillers of the 90's with a superb script by john and rick dahl that kept you guessing throughout and on the edge of your seat for most of the film it was brilliantly directed by john dahl and featured a marvellous cast including nicolas cage dennis hopper lara flynn boyle and especially j t walsh in a memorable performance making this a riveting and captivating thriller not to be missed the film never had much publicity on release in fact i first caught up with it on tv and is therefore one of those special little gems that you have to seek out but this unique film is now slowly gaining a cult following br br nicolas cage is michael williams who is broke and out of work when he finds himself in the small town of red rock mistaken for a contract killer named lyle from dallas he is shocked to be offered 10 000 to murder the wife of bar owner wayne brown the excellent j t walsh he plays along with the plan and decides he should go and warn brown's wife suzanne lara flynn boyle but then the plot thickens and there are so many twists turns and surprises and double dealings that cage is thrown from one crisis to another and finds himself trapped in a terrible situation he can't drag himself out of then just to complicate matters even further the real lyle turns up to carry out the contract killing played by everyone's favourite heavy dennis hopper when hopper discovers what has happened he goes after cage but no one could forsee the surprising events that follow br br some favourite lines from the film br br nicolas cage to lara flynn boyle i hate to see an innocent woman get hurt but it's an awful lot of money br br j t walsh to cage michael williams well michael you're going to be spending some time with us till we get to the bottom of this br br boyle to cage you're not a killer cage that's right no but the guy i'm supposed to be just rode into town so you gotta get out of here br br boyle to cage o k how you're going to explain impersonating a hired killer and taking 10 000 from my husband br br an extraordinarily entertaining little thriller just 98 minutes with a storyline that never lets up and powerful acting by all the principals any film featuring j t walsh is o k in my book and red rock west was one of his best how sad it was that this exceptional actor's career was cut tragically short by a heart attack in 1998 the most prolific period for film noir was without any doubt the forties but red rock west is a good modern example of the genre and has jumped right into my top ten list of all time favourite films i look forward to more like this from director john dahl 10 10 clive roberts br br
i have seen the running man several times as i am a stephen king fan and have all his movies but now it is even better because up until 2 days ago i didn't know about this website and i didn't realize that the paul michael glaser that was involved with this movie was the same paul michael glaser that i grow up watching on starsky and hutch television show for me this is a pleasant surprise because i can't tell you how many times i cried when starsky or hutch got hurt the episode where starsky kill starsky almost died i cried so hard my dad had to turn away from the show what to you expect of a kid at age 12 now i intentionally look for films and programs involving paul or david soul and anything that stephen king has his hands on i'm so there just got to say happy birthday paul
eddie murphy really made me laugh my ass off on this hbo stand up comedy show i love his impressions of mr t ed norton and ralph cramden of the honeymooners elvis presley and michael jackson too the ice cream man goony goo goo is also funny i saw this for the first time when it came out in 1984 i laughed so hard i almost fell off my chair i still think this is very funny br br eddie murphy when he was on saturday night live made me laugh so hard he is one of the best people to come out of saturday night live eddie murphy delirious is his best stand up performance next to eddie murphy raw br br i give eddie murphy delirious 2 thumbs up and 10 10 stars
i honestly think that that was the best version of war of the worlds i've every seen it was funny but it was also educational i learned whole lot the movie and if i could i would by that movie my favorite part was when the soldiers killed on robot and another one came right from behind it in the last movie war of the world i think that it should have been more like the first one and it would have been better but any way i give this movie 2 thumbs up br br and if they where to make another movie like this i will definitely watch it br br thank you
this is the true story of how three british soldiers escaped from the german prisoner of war pow camp stalag luft iii during the second world war this is the same pow camp that was the scene for the great escape which resulted in the murder of 50 re captured officers by the gestapo and later was made into a very successful movie of the same name br br while the other pows in stalag luft iii are busy working on their three massive tunnels known as tom dick harry two enterprising british prisoners came up with the idea to build a wooden vaulting horse which could be placed near the compound wire fence shortening the distance they would have to tunnel from this starting point to freedom the idea to build their version of the trojan horse came to them while they were discussing 'classic' attempts for escape and observing some pows playing leap frog in the compound br br initially containing one and later with two pows hidden inside the wooden horse could be carried out into the compound and placed in almost the same position near the fence on a daily basis while volunteer pows vaulted over the horse the escapees were busy inside the horse digging a tunnel from under the vaulting horse while positioned near the wire under the wire and into the woods br br the story also details the dangers that two of the three escaping pows faced while traveling through germany and occupied europe after they emerged from the tunnel all three pows who tried to escape actually hit home runs escaped successfully to their home base the wooden horse gives a very accurate and true feeling of the tension and events of a pow breakout the movie was shot on the actual locations along the route the two pows traveled in their escape made with far less a budget than the great escape the wooden horse is more realistic if not more exciting than the great escape and never fails to keep you from the edge of your seat rooting for the pows to make good their escape br br the story line is crisp and the acting rings true and is taut enough to keep the tension up all the way through the movie the wooden horse is based on the book of the same name by one of the escapees eric williams and is by far the best pow escape story ever made into a movie some of the actual pows were used in the movie to reprise their existence as prisoners in stalag luft iii i give this movie a well deserved ten
ok so it's a low budget film i used the quotes because it was shot in hi 8 video the acting is universally horrid the makeup is laughable the blood looks like it came from sherwin williams and i've seen more convincing bruises made from halloween ghoul kits and the lighting generally looks like they used someone's borrowed toyota pickup to shine headlights on the actors br br i might be able to forgive these low budget traits if there were some actual content if a movie made an attempt to tell a story but this collection of video footage can boast of no plot no real characters and no momentum it's a self indulgent mess br br and don't worry no spoilers here 'cause there's absolutely nothing to spoil
i am currently doing film studies at a s level and this is not a love song is a film we watched and in my opinion it is a film with a very simple storyline but a complex back story if you scratch the surface you will find a thriller chase film of two men running through the countryside from farmers after committing a murder sounds quite exiting br br however you need to dig deeper to uncover the true feeling of the true genre as it is suggested it is a love story between two homosexual lovers filled with trust deceit and betrayal we are not told about this love directly through the film but the events that happen through out for example the way heaton acts towards spike almost screams this untouched love affair in our faces br br overall this film is a good example of why british films should not be dismissed as rubbish just because they are done on a low budget br br a good film with an intricate story line however it is definitely an acquired taste and is possibly not suitable for the average fan of hollywood blockbusters
although i agree that it's a good but not great movie for many of the reasons other posters have mentioned i still enjoy it one reason is the music i'd call attention to the very cool appearance by the candoli brothers conte and pete in a well staged scene in the nightclub these guys were two of the best jazz trumpeters of their day and they manage to convincingly boggle the mind of jimmy stewart by playing an hysterical trumpet duet one trumpet in each of stewart's ears the candolis really did play that well too though i suspect the actual music for that scene was dubbed later by the two of them i don't know much about george duning who gets the credit for the music other than that he seems to have worked with the three stooges on more than one occasion but the casting of the candoli brothers as jazz playing warlocks was a real nice touch

perhaps the funniest 'backstage at hollywood' movie ever especially for a look at comedy short factories like keystone br br marion davies should get a medal for bravery for taking a part where acting poorly in front of a camera is part of the role plenty of cameos for film buffs
as drunken millionaire playboy arthur bach dudley moore is perfect as a grown man trapped in childhood as it turned out the role fit moore so perfectly it trapped him as an actor as well many disappointments soon followed including this film's pale sequel yet that doesn't diminish the charm or appeal of this picture which is cleverly written and directed some of moore's drunk scenes are forced parts of the film are wobbly but the cast performs with so much relish it's a difficult movie to resist it has a very big heart and gives oscar winner john gielgud a sly dryly amusing role as arthur's valet hobson his relationship with arthur is delicious and they have a miraculous rapport liza minnelli as a blue collar love interest is sassy in a low key and moore is brash but deft and lively he never shook off the shadow of arthur but at least we have this document of a career high point to cherish from
when i think 'women in prison' my mind often goes to sleazy italian spanish productions by directors such as jess franco and bruno mattei and while these films are often very sleazy they're also very samey and once you've seen one you might as well have seen them all i have to admit that these types of films generally aren't my favourites but in fact the idea of women behind bars has been done very well on several occasions outside of italy and spain and roger corman's new world pictures is responsible for some of the best of them caged heat is the directorial debut of oscar winning director jonathan demme and it's a well done little flick with plenty of entertainment value naturally the film centres on the story of a girl who is caught committing crime and sent to a women's' prison where she is introduced to a host of violent inmates this prison is ruled over by the stuff wheelchair bound superintendent mcqueen and she takes offence to a play put on by the girls leading them to plot an escape br br this film is much lighter on the sleaze than i'm used to in a women in prison flick but this is more than compensated for by some great action scenes and dialogue and that's what ensures caged heat entertains throughout it does have to be said that the plot is not particularly original or ambitious and basically follows a structure similar to many other women in prison films that came before it but that's not such a big problem the film never gets boring and is peppered with standout scenes including an escape attempt while out working in a field and a bank robbery the film is helped along by assured direction from the man who would go on to helm the masterpiece the silence of the lambs and a great cast with plenty of standouts including best of all the legendary barbara steele in the role of the head prison warden overall caged heat may not leave the viewer with much to think about by the end but it's a brilliantly entertaining little grindhouse flick and anyone that enjoys this type of film will surely want to track it down
for the life of me i can't figure out why anyone would make a movie like this the plot is tired the acting is strained the language is consistently foul and at times the over use of the f word seemed like a lack of dialog was prevalent so 'let's throw in another couple of f's for good measure that's what the american public wants to hear' gossett was particularly foul and seemed to enjoy his part forget this c p rent 'shrek and have a good laugh
the dinner party could quite possibly be in my opinion the greatest adult cinema production of all time it is produced in such an exquisite manner and the actors portray their roles excellently the kitchen scene starring yvonne and juli ashton is magnificent the use of the butter and milk really makes the scene additionally the doctor's office scene is well done the campfire scene is filled with enjoyable action though the choice of actors in this scene is questionable asia carrera's performance in the junkyard scene is incredible but who would expect anything less from her the closing scene is somewhat over used in adult films but is classic none the less i would highly recommend this film to all fans of adult films and those casual viewers run out to your video store and pick it up today
this movie makes no sense at all there are plot holes big enough to drive enormous nypd vehicles through the characters do not act in any plausible way whatsoever i will put my comments in the chat board but save your time and money this is stupid i can't stand when hollywood spends millions of dollars on flash bang equipment and uses fancy editing and cool music and does not bother to have a plot that hangs together at even the most basic level but it is nice to see denzel w prevail over the man who comes in 3 flavors jodi foster mayor bloomberg and capt von trapp there is even a sweet little kid with a video game who is nice
this movie is just boring br br it tries to copy some effects borrowed to a creative director like jeunet in amélie poulain but it is too much the dialogs are pretty bad some of the worst i have ever heard guillaume canet is not convincing i have almost never found him very convincing his father in the movie plays very badly the story is dumb the ending is stupid br br i think i have not dislike a movie so much since le pacte des loups brotherhood of the wolf from christophe gans and i watch see about 80 100 movies a year but at least that movie had some action and lots of good actors br br i had never commented here only rated and when i saw the rating and the comments i thought i had to write something down br br i guess we won't have problems to sell the dvd we were offered not such a bad movie in our large collection br br i am open minded i watch sf westerns drama comedies silents horror fantasy movies but this movie was so boring that i felt like i had lost one hour and a half
a true anomaly in the french cinema this despairing work has no equivalent in the contemporary production one would rather have to look on the side of louis malle's le feu follet 1963 the fire within to find something not completely unlike harel's effort wry and cynical having lost all his illusions the hero a computer scientist has got no more reason to live absolutely none estranged from the human race he seems to live his life as some kind of entomologist studying his colleagues one of them catches his attention tisserand josé garcia plays the most demeaning part of the decade then tisserand will become some kind of prey all his pessimism will rub off on this poor man the scene is the night club climaxes the strange relationship the hero tells his victim that his life will always be unfulfilled unless he well now the movie takes a more conventional turn so to speak clouzot's misanthropy maybe but just for a while br br the form is weird beyond comment there are two voices over one for the narrator who always refers to the main character as our hero one for the aforementioned hero the story takes place now in paris now in rouen guy de maupassant's town in a scene with his shrink the hero says the writer's madness was only the expression of his disgust for man and he draws a parallel between his despair and maupassant's one br br this depressing movie is only suitable for an informed audience not for the very short excerpts of x rated movies but because after watching it you may be feeling down in the dumps
when you see the cover of the dvd you're convinced this is some class b cheesy cheapie a film made for 1 000 in somebody's backyard br br wrong br br this is quality material and really good it's a comedy and a clever one at that it also is very touching in spots with a nice spot of kindness the production values are very good this looks excellent the actors are known the film's direction and sets are great it's amazing who would have thought br br carrie ann moss playing against type is terrific as helen robinson the june cleaver like wife billy connolly is great as the grunting good hearted zombie fido tim blake nelson mr theopolis is a hoot is the neighbor with the sexy zombie girlfriend tammy and henry czerny and dylan baker as dads check are excellent too k'sun ray as young timmy robinson shouldn't be overlooked either in fact he probably has more lines in the movie than anyone br br if i explain the story it will sound so stupid that few of you would watch it you'll just have to take the word of the people here who liked it and found it to be a very very pleasant surprise you need a dark sense of humor though an appreciation of the absurd
may contain spoilers br br i say that but anyone savvy enough to be reading this can probably figure out every plot turn right from the start br br this is not a movie that i liked i didn't hate it in the way of some movies that insult your intelligence but it all felt too predictable on its trudge to the requisite happy ending there were funny bits along the way to be sure but few were original at least it didn't go for the gutter br br christina applegate looks fresh and ben affleck works hard their scenes together are actually the only redeeming feature everyone else is a cardboard cutout including surprisingly james gandolfini who must have made this as a favor to someone br br all in all it's a harmless but not inspiring 90 minutes
i saw this movie originally in the theater when i was 10 even at that age the 'humor' was mildly insulting to my adolescent intelligence br br in the past whenever i would see ed begley jr or jeff goldblum i would cringe and start to feel very uncomfortable and even slightly sad until i was reminded of the existence of this movie today i was unsure why i felt that way apparently i blocked my memory of this movie yet my negative feelings towards two of the perpetrators remained apparently i forgot that i saw this movie but subconsciously mourned the pieces of my soul that had been stolen nay eaten by the creators of this inhuman work br br i haven't been brave enough to try watching it as an adult i imagine that as part of the healing process that i should probably look at confronting this childhood fear so that i can truly put it behind me some regression therapy and or hypnosis might not be a bad idea either
power rangers the moronic merchandising television kids show from the 1990s has got to be the most pointless and ridiculous television show ever created br br what exactly is the point of this show anyway other than to sell second rate plastic nonsense to children there is nothing even remotely redeeming or interesting about this show in anyway br br look at the costumes which look like spandex gone bad br br the mullet style hair earrings and fashions of the early 1990s look completely ridiculous these days br br avoid this show at all costs
as a low budget enterprise in which the filmmakers themselves are manufacturing and distributing the dvds themselves we perhaps shouldn't expect too much from broken in disc form and yet what's most remarkable about this whole achievement is the fact that this release comes with enough extras to shame a james cameron dvd and a decidedly fine presentation br br with regards to the latter the only major flaw is that broken comes with a non anamorphic transfer otherwise we get the film in its original 1 85 1 ratio demonstrating no technical flaws and looking pretty much as should be expected indeed given ferrari's hands on approach in putting this disc together you can pretty much guarantee such a fact br br the same is also true of the soundtrack here we are offered both dd2 0 and dd5 1 mixes and whilst i'm uncertain as to which should be deemed the original the fact that ferrari had an involvement in both means neither should be considered as inferior indeed though the dd5 1 may offer a more atmosphere viewing experience owing to the manner in which it utilizes the score both are equally fine and free of technical flaws br br as for extras the disc is positively overwhelmed by them take a look at the sidebar on the right of the screen and you'll notice numerous commentaries loads of featurettes and various galleries indeed given the manner in which everything has been broken down into minute chunks rather than compiled into a lengthy documentary there really is little to discuss the 'anatomy of a stunt' featurette for example is exactly what it claims to be and the same goes for the rest of pieces as such we get coverage on pretty much ever aspect of broken's pre production production and post production and whilst it may have been preferable to find them in a more easily digestible overall 'making of' in this manner we do get easy access to whatever special feature we may wish to view br br of the various pieces then it is perhaps only the commentaries which need any kind of discussion then again there's also a predictable air to each of the chat tracks the one involving the actors is overly jokey and doesn't take the film too seriously ferrari's pieces are incredibly enthusiastic about the whole thing and the technical ones are well extremely technical of course we also get some crossover with what's been covered elsewhere on the discs but at only 19 minutes none of these pieces outstay their welcome indeed all in all a fine extras package
as is nearly always the case when britain comes up with an entertaining and or successful sit com or quiz show the yanks will come along and poach the format and produce their own grossly inferior version man about the house is of course no exception to that rule the yanks' version three's company was unwatchable braindead pap that seem to run forever a prime example of quantity over non existent quality the original on the other hand is a fondly remembered gem that had the savvy like fawlty towers to pull the plug at precisely the right time unlike the 637 episodes of 'hilarity' that three's company came up with jo was cute there was brilliant chemistry between the ropers richard o'sullivan made it all look so easy the scripts whilst not exactly oscar wilde standard were consistently funny and chrissy was the most drop dead gorgeous woman who has walked the face of this planet since the dead sea was merely feeling unwell 'nuff said
probably the first portuguese film i have seen in my life and i enjoyed it the plot is related of how the young army officers took the power in portugal in 1974 to finally defeat the fascist government of caetano and to also finalize the wars in the colonies i e mozambique angola and guinea bissau cape vert most of the events shown in the film reflect with exactitude the behavior of the army officers and soldiers to conduct the coup of the oppressed people who were very happy with this new development and the liberty the resistance of caetano's men and also in a subtle way of most conservative officials including spinola who took over as the new president the portuguese revolution can be remembered because of the action of several young officers but for me the most interesting part of the film was when the young captain expressed that portugal should develop itself democratically and this is what the country achieved some years after this coup or revolution the film also shows that the army officers and soldiers never wanted to kill anyone even the most serious enemies were respected at the end
despite some reviews being distinctly luke warm i found the story totally engrossing and even if some critics have described the love story as 'mills and boon' so what it is good to see a warm touching story of real love in these cynical times many in the audience were sniffing and surreptitiously dabbing their eyes you really believe that the young victoria and albert are passionately fond of each other even though for political reasons it was an arranged marriage i did feel though that sir john conroy who was desperate to control the young queen is perhaps played too like a pantomime villain as it is rumoured that he was in fact the real father of victoria as a result of an affair with her mother the duchess of kent it would have been interesting to explore this theory emily blunt is totally convincing as the young princess trapped in the stifling palace with courtiers and politicians out to manipulate her she brilliantly portrays the strength of character and determination that eventually made victoria a great queen of england which prospered as never before under her long reign i believe word of mouth recommendations will ensure great success for this most enjoyable and wonderful looking movie
having read another review i thought this movie would actually be good i do enjoy the b movies but this couldn't even be classed as such the photography is probably the only half way decent thing in the movie but the editing left much to be desired it was very choppy and staccato whoever chose the music and sound did a terrible job the music was awful specially anything atmospheric or scene setting if the acting had been better they could have pulled the movie off unfortunately i've seen better acting in porn flicks if you want to see a b vampire movie check out 'blood ties' you'll be much more entertained
well then what is it i found nicholson's character shallow and most unfortunately uninteresting angelica huston's character drained my power and kathleen turner is a filthy no good slut it's not that i don't get it it's not that i don't think that some of the ideas could've lead to something more this is a film with nothing but the notion that we're supposed to accept these ideas and that's what the movie has going for it that nicholson falls for turner is absurd but then again it is intended to be so this however does not strike me as a funny or b even remotely interesting this was a waste of my time so don't let the hype get the best of you it is a waste of your time with all that being said the opening church sequence is quite beautiful
this anime series starts out great interesting story exciting events interesting characters beautifully rendered and executed not everything is explained right away dangling a proverbial carrot before the viewer enticing the viewer to watch each succeeding episode but imagine the disappointment to find that the sci fi thriller giant robot adventure is only a backdrop for psycho babble and quasi religious preachy exploitation if you want to hear you're ok it's good to be you after being embattled with negative slogans and the characters' negative emotions then this is for you if you want a good sci fi flick that is simply fun to watch forget this one both the original and the alternate endings were grossly disappointing to me all that and this movie was too preachy
maybe the greatest film ever about jazz br br it is jazz br br the opening shot continues to haunt my reverie br br lester of course is wonderful and out of this world br br jo jones is always a delight see the sound of jazz as well br br if you can find the music it's available on cd br br all lovers of jazz and film noir should study this tremendous jewel br br what shadows and light what music what a hat
this is my first cg animated film that i've ever seen usually the look of other animated films made me reticent to see them not ice age i wanted to see it the moment i saw the trailer with scrat the hilarious sabertooth squirrel br br ice age was sporadically funny and overall fun film to watch the story is basically an animated version of three men and a baby set 20 000 years in the past the visuals were great simply beautiful it's one thing to create convincing aninmation it's another thing altogether to create visually arresting stuff and ice age is great to look at with its stylized visuals blue sky studios is a company to look out for in the future
some war movies succeed where others do not and that can be judged from a variety of angles the humanistic angle one where you can feel the raw emotions the terror of being under attack the camaraderie amongst soldiers the arduous trials people face inside them when in combat etc are always movies i find compelling movies like das boot and a midnight clear are but two examples of movies that you sense a connection to the characters in the film br br this film succeeds on that level as well it speaks of the highest honor and that honor is doing the right thing these 23 soldiers did the right thing they had honor and it is recognized in a way wholly incompatible with western thought but it is to the very end a true story of honor unforgettable movie based on the true story
the plot of this film might not be extraordinary but what makes the film really special are its characters and the actors who play them  of course i won't go into the details of the plot of the movie but i would certainly like to say this  this film is not just for everyone the film is really witty and you need to be equally clever to get all the satire if you're not alert even for a second you'll probably end up missing one of the subtle points the movie is full of such seemingly trivial but witty stuff like the announcements going on in the background at turaqistan the advertisements on the tankers which i almost missed and it are these that make the movie hilarious throughout br br coming to the actors john cusack has played his multi faceted role very efficiently what with him being the co writer and the producer too and he plays his character  hauser the killer with a heart  exquisitely cusack's done a similar kind of role before in grosse pointe blank but his comic disposition in the movie is simply superb br br however the actress who steals all the show is hilary duff i have always been a huge fan of ms duff but to be honest i was a bit disappointed when i heard about the kind of role she's playing in the movie but after watching the movie the disappointment gave way to great respect for her as an actor let's face it the kid's growing but yes so is her talent all those critics who shouted hoarse that hilary cannot act will be silent for a while hilary had to play a really complex character  tough on the outside yet a sweet child on the inside  and she's done complete justice to it she makes you laugh and she makes you cry  to cut the long story short 'cause i could go on raving about her for ever she's brilliant marisa tomei and joan cusack have done a good job too especially joan's hysterics are uproarious however i was rather disappointed with ben kingsley being wasted in such a small role and his performance seemed lackluster br br in general war inc keeps you on your toes throughout with its intelligent humor and ends with just the right amount of twists in the plot i would highly recommend this movie to all and more so to hilary duff fans p s i am really glad to hear the movie is going to break free of its limited release and release at other places soon
when i first went to watch the shining i was expecting a decent film from what i had heard about it and i liked a lot of stanley kubrick's other work but when i started to watch it it was so much better than i thought it would be at times i seriously felt ridiculously uneasy and i couldn't take my eyes of the screen still there's something very disturbing about everything in the film now some people don't like kubrick's version of the shining since it doesn't entirely follow stephen king's book but in my opinion both kubrick's version the mini series and the book are all great jack nicholson gives an awesome performance if you are looking for a good original movie that will keep you thinking even after the movies over then watch the shining
carlos mencia continually violently hatefully screaming b ch at women is like screaming n ger at black people except it's worse remember the b word unlike the n word is the only pejorative term that is still associated on a daily basis with violence b ch is the last thing women hear before they are raped beaten or murdered this guy is perpetuating violence by hatefully using the language of violence sounds like he may be a gay guy trying to cover by woman bashing so that he will sound like a hetero and how about all the nazi white guys in his audience giving the fascist salutes while their stupid little bimbo white women whimper tee hee hee at their side clearly terrified to protest this tidal wave of woman hating tee hee hee bet mencia doesn't believe or support free speech for them come on carlos  do you want women to have the free speech to b ch slap you as loudly and violently and big mouthed as you do or do you think free speech is only for men to crap on women
there are movies like plan 9 that are so bad they have a charm about them there are some like waterworld that have the same inexplicable draw as a car accident and there are some like desperate living that you hate to admit you love cowgirls have none of these redemptions the cast assembled has enough talent to make almost any plot watchable and from what i've been told the book is enjoyable br br how then could this movie be so intolerably bad to begin with it seems the director brought together a cast of names with no other tie than what will bring in the 20 somethings then tell them to do their best kevin costner imitations open the book at random and start shooting whatever is on the page making sure to keep the wide expanses of america from being interesting in any way finally give the editing job to your brother in law because the meat packing plant just laid him off he does have twenty years of cutting experience br br this movie now defines the basement for me it is so bad it isn't even good for being bad
this ambitious film suffers most from writer director paul thomas anderson's delusions of grandeur highly derivative of much better material altman's nashville lumet's network this lumbering elephant takes far too long to get nowhere a couple of misguided detours along the way an embarrassing musical interlude a biblical plague don't help matters neither does the uneven level of performances especially bad william h macy whose character and storyline could easily have been eliminated altogether julianne moore for her unconvincing angst and how many times must we see john c reilly's sad sack shtick chicago and the hours will suffice tom cruise comes off well by comparison  his misogynist foul mouthed holy roller was rather amusing speaking of foul mouths the script was so loaded with f bombs they lost their impact in no time don't even talk about that awful soundtrack full of insipid and annoying vocals by aimee mann her extended rendition of one a maudlin number to begin with drove me to distraction at the start of the film i should have heeded the handwriting on the wall and saved myself three more hours by which time i'd been pushed to the brink of hell one redeeming feature which i haven't seen mentioned in other reviews is the best performance in the bunch by unknown melora walters in the role of claudia the damaged coke fiend bent on self destruction her credibility exceeded all others by far this film took itself way too seriously and just didn't know when to end
the town of royston vasey is a weird but wonderful place the characters would be just wrong and too disturbing but the fantastically brilliant writing means that it works and it works very well most people will know others with a touch of some characters but hopefully no one knows people with extremes of personalities such as tubbs and edward the stranger hating owners of the local shop or the pen obsessed pauline who treats dole scum with much contempt that was only a few of the strange inhabitants the tv works consists of 3 series and a christmas special there are references to many horror films such as the wicker man a more recent addition to the range of works is a film the league of gentlemens apocalypse of which i will not say much but highly recommend all in all the league of gentlemen is a hilarious comedy show with genius writing and brilliantly bonkers characters i would definitely say that it is worth watching as you wont regret it
but a lousy film as maltin says this was christopher lee's attempt to make a serious horror film well it is serious too serious the plot is silly and slow something about old people inhabiting the bodies of young children to achieve immortality the film is all talk talk talk talk talk talk talk about the same things over and over again i actually dozed off a few times the film is sooooo dull the cast sleepwalks through this with the sole exceptions of peter cushing and lee but this was probably a labor of love for both they often complained about horror movies being too violent well this has no violence avoid at all costs unless you have insomnia this will put you to sleep
this film is terrible the characters are completely unbelievable and wildly inconsistent the plot is awful and some of the classroom scenes are cringe worthy and make for uncomfortable viewing br br in fact the quality of the script and characterisation would suggest that this film was written by high school students only the utter lack of credibility to the school environment would suggest that in fact the writers probably never went to high school the acting in most cases was weak too although a lot of this was down to a poor script and plot i am not sure that any actors could have made this film watchable br br having said that the sound track was ok and the cinematography was nice in places although the editing was poor
i can see why this film was oscar nominated for best live action short as it was constructed masterfully even if you don't particularly like the blues though to me this sounded much more like jazz you can easily appreciate this film it is simply very well made though for the life of me i can't see why director gjon mili only got to direct one film this one in other words the film is nominated and yet the director didn't get any sort of career boost as for the black performers i could understand this not causing their careers to shift into high gear as unfortunately most of white society have indifference or worse for blacks or that kind of music br br if you do watch this film if you aren't particularly enjoying the earlier portion skip ahead to about the 5 50 mark where it picks up considerably when the lady stopped singing and the performers began to improvise the pace improved quite a bit
when i was a kid of 8 i always watched movies and television that i wasn't supposed to and this was one of them br br it's one of my favorite movies of all time and it has to be the funniest movie i have ever seen in my life the acting is excellent they don't make comedies like this anymore these days movies that are actually funny and make you laugh without resorting to excrement or some type of vomit inducing body fluid as in those retarded judd apatow movies starring unfunny non actors like seth rogen barf br br this movie is a classic with actors who can actually act and deserve all the accolades
i guess when beat street made a national appearance flashdance came at the same time the problem with flashdance is that there was only one break dancing scene and the rest was jazz dance and ballet that was one of the reasons why beat street was better the only movie that could rival beat street seems to be footloose because both movies focused on how dance had been used by people to express their utmost feelings br br the break dance scenes in beat street come just before the middle and at the end of the flick and i loved all of them almost all of the break tricks were featured in the break jam scenes the jackhammer the flares the head spins the suicide sit the crazy legs the mortal the forward flip the figure four almost everything br br like the warriors beat street does have violence related to the gang life in the hip hop world but in a much less violent way than the former the only major fight scene in beat street was when graffiti artist ramon which in the movie was abbreviated as ramo is chased by a rival gang member on the new york city subway tracks fighting each other on the third rail and both dying by electrocution on that rail well although that chase scene ended tragically it was better that they died that way than having blood exploding from a gang gunshot br br most of the gang stuff in the flick was graffiti related to the hip hop culture and rap music a lot of rap music appeared in the flick because hip hop members used rap music as a diversion to the negative aspects of gang life even the theme song of the movie which closed the curtain to the flick was not just an homage to hip hop culture it also was an homage to the death of ramon br br by the way during the dance scene called 'tango tango' i guess the female drummer in the pit orchestra conducted by actress rae dawn chong was sheila e making a cameo appearance
br br i saw the glacier fox in the theatre when i was nine years old i bugged my parents to take me back three times i began looking for it on video about five years ago finally uncovering a copy on an online auction site but i would love to see it either picked up by a new distributor and rereleased i understand the original video run was small or have the rights purchased by the family channel disney etc and shown regularly it is a fascinating film that draws you into the story of the life struggle of a family of foxes in northern japan narrated by a wise old tree the excellent soundtrack compliments the film well it would be a good seller today better than many of the weak offerings to children's movies today
note these comments are for people who have seen the movie br br vanilla sky is a brilliant complex and thrilling movie that existentially explores exactly what the tag line says lovehatedreamslifeworkplayfriends maybe the movie plot can come into focus for confused movie goers if one looks at it from a different angle br br considering the following br br now i have not painstakingly gone through the film scene by scene so i will have to further examine my assertions and i welcome your thoughts but give this a try and see if the movie doesn't fall into place where exactly does the debatable 'splice' occur br br now i'm not talking about the splice as it is explained by the l e 'technician' since that sequence itself could be actually interpreted as a rationalization inside of david aames's mind dream coma state but the true splice between reality and dream br br it seems to me that the reality of the car crash the way that it is filmed no explosion for example is a likely 'splice' point and that any particular sequence containing an existential dream coma non reality feel to it whether it's shown onscreen before or after the crash is actually a part of aames' personal journey toward self realization inside of his own mind br br in that respect then we are left with two questions at the very end if you know of more let me know is aames actually disfigured and where does he wake up br br if you don't get entirely wrapped up in the exact sequence of details in the plot or at what particular point his dreams are scattered throughout this movie becomes a fascinating exploration of a human on a journey to find himself and what that means in today's pop culture society br br
do not watch this movie if you loved the classics such as tom wopat john schneider catherine bach sorrell booke james best denver pyle sonny shroyer and ben jones this movie will dissappoint you badly first of all this movie starts out with bo and luke running moonshine for jesse bo and luke would not do that ever on the real series this movie portrays unimaginable characters doing things that never would have happened in the series in the series uncle jesse was honest and law abiding in this movie he is a criminal who is making moonshine and smoking weed with the governor of georgia plus if this was an extension adding on to the dukes of hazzard reunion and the dukes of hazzard in hollywood i have one question how could uncle jesse be making moonshine when he died before the dukes of hazzard in hollywood movie and how is boss hogg alive when he died before the reunion movie in 1997 movie and rosco ran hazzard it seems magical that these characters came back to life when they have been dead for 11 and 8 years if hollywood really wanted to make a good movie they should have brought back james best john schneider tom wopat ben jones and catherine bach like they did in 1997 and 2000 and made a family friendly movie with the living original characters that made the show what it was and still is compared to this disgusting disgraced movie if you want to see good dukes movies either buy the original series or go out to walmart com and buy the dvd set of 2 that includes the reunion and dukes of hazzard in hollywood movies they both star the original cast and are family friendly don't waste your time on a movie that isn't worth the cd it's written on
magnolia is a preposterous bewildering acting showcase that adds up to very little like eyes wide shut magnolia is an aimless series of episodes without any concern for coherence the camera swoops through hallways and corridors catching glimpses of sad characters where is the reason to care for these people the common theme seems to be people who yell a lot who can't care for others except for john c reilly's and philip seymour hoffman's characters and are self destructive jerks who are either falling to pieces or dying i was reminded of how much i disliked shine because of the irredeemable monster of a father played by armin mueller stahl there are so many unattractive unappealing characters here why would we want to spend time with them br br having said that there is nothing held back about magnolia paul thomas anderson's ideas are splashed onto his canvas with abandon there are two ideas in particular that bomb both happen in the last hour of this 188 minute film one has the camera flipping from one character to another while each one sings one of aimee mann's coffeehouse folk songs sweet but ineffectual since we can't see what strings them all together the other idea i refer to cannot be revealed other than to say it is completely unexpected and completely ridiculous br br magnolia has a lot of great acting particularly tom cruise who unleashes a performance i didn't know he had in him and john c reilly plays maybe the most decent and truly good cop in recent memory but it all adds up to nothing when the secret unexpected event happened a girl behind me in the theatre couldn't hold it in any more and said this is stupid my feeling is the majority of moviegoers will agree
i was really stunned how much a film that's over 60 years old could impress me it is nearly two hours long there are absolutely no stars in it there are subtitles but nevertheless it is interesting and exciting to watch what impressed me mostly was the realism of the film you could nearly feel the coldness of the ice because you could see that the storms are real this is a relief in a cgi world like ourdays i wondered how much work this must have been for van dyke i read somewhere that it took 17 months to film it now who wants to talk about 'titanic' anymore it's a great film with a great message and i would recommend it to future directors to see how great and realistic movies can be if they are only directed with realism instead of visual effects
who would have thought that a movie about a man who drives a couple hundreds of miles on his lawn mower to see his brother could possibly be good cinema i certainly didn't i thought i knew what to expect one of the most boring experiences of my life well i was as wrong as i haven't been wrong too often yet because this is one of the best most realistic and honest hollywood films i've ever seen br br giving a short resume of the straight story isn't very difficult it's about an old and stubborn man who steps on his lawn mower and drives off to another state to pay his brother a visit when he hears that the man has had a severe stroke that's already special on itself but what makes it even more special is the fact that he hasn't seen his brother in ten years because of some stupid argument in the meantime he has his share of bad luck and problems but he also meets a lot of people whose lives he influences in one way or another with his philosophical approach to life despite all the difficulties he drives on for weeks not knowing if he will reach his goal seeing his brother again before it's too late br br i can easily understand why there are people who don't like this movie and that's also the reason why i will not say that these people don't have a heart or things like that this movie hasn't got any flashy action scenes it is as slow as the lawn mower the man is driving on and no you don't have to watch it for the nice soundtrack either because there isn't any but why should you watch it then well the simple answer is the story i haven't seen such a touching movie with such a powerful story very often and the fact that this actually comes from hollywood and to make things even better from the disney studio's that's right the same studios that overwhelm us with sugar sweet nonsense makes it even more special i'm not ashamed to admit that i had the tears in my eyes a couple of times while watching it probably because the whole situation of not seeing someone for many years because of some stupid argument is all too realistic for me br br some people will argue that the story is very shallow but i really don't agree with that perhaps it is because they only see that old man driving on his lawn mower and don't want to think any further if you look close enough than you'll understand that this man is doing all this because he knows he has once been wrong that only his pride stood in the way of seeing his brother again and that he wants everybody else to see that too so they won't make the same mistake if that isn't deep enough how much deeper does a story have to go for you then br br i would also like to add that this movie really had it all some beautiful landscapes finally an american movie that shows something else than the skyline of new york chicago or some other big city some very fine acting by richard farnsworth sissy spacek and a very understandable way of telling despite the fact that this is a david lynch movie i know now that i was completely wrong by assuming that this movie wouldn't be to my taste it's one of the very best movies i've seen in a long time this movie aimed for my heart and hit the bull's eye i give it the full 10 10
i have always been keen on watching hong kong movies but all of them failed to meet my expectations until now burning paradise doesn't contain the flat humor most hk movies have nor a second rate story line that has been dragged into the film the story is not complex but there are never scenes that are just there to fill some intelligent space the only truely intelligent martial arts film i have seen is crouching tiger but since hollywood is involved it is no true hk movie for me there are some incredible fight scenes in this movie from the first one which is one of the coolest i have ever seen yet so short to the last main scenes but mind there's also a lot of blood that flows people cut in half decapitated etc the production is pretty good and the special effects show that the fantasy of the writer can be fulfilled even though some shots must be pretty technical notice the sheet of paper that he throws and got pinned into a wall yep it's not tsui hark or john woo that made my favorite hong kong film it's ringo lam and i'm sure as hell going to check out more from this director ace
the cast is ok the script is awkward at times and it takes a while to figure out what the point of the movie is i found myself looking forward to doing the dishes the shehan bit is a cheesy statement on the war i guess we were supposed to not notice it we did its a house you did nothing more than kill forty five minutes the shower part huh what was that about literally it is i have a client ok you can use our shower yawn the angles are trying way to hard there was a set of woods suddenly its gone cause you can see right through then next it is deep and animals are dying in the end this is a horrendous movie of boring proportions
i'm gonna give it to ya straight this movie is amazing foreign gay films are so fast surpassing american gay films in production quality acting and story while so many american indie gay films are grainy bad sound amateur acting trite story lines and a surprising lack of any nudity or erotica top quality foreign gay films have been popping up like this one from france the cinematography is beautiful thought out meaningful the story is adult and complex but not difficult for anyone to follow the acting is intense and professional both leads are fantastic as well as the entire cast the boys are more than just good looking and there's plenty of full frontal nudity you follow the entire year of these boys from their meeting to the end all the little nuances of a relationship's the details of falling in and out of love are there beautifully performed it left me wanting more check it out
oh man if you want to give your internal crow t robot a real workout this is the movie to pop into the ol' vcr the potential for cut up lines in this film is just endless br br minor spoilers ahead hey do you really care if a film of this quality is spoiled traci is a girl with a problem psychology has developed names for it when a child develops a sexual crush on the opposite sex parent but this girl seems to have one for her same sex one and i don't think there's a term for that it might be because her mother dana is played by rosanna arquette whose cute overbite neo flowerchild sexuality and luscious figure makes me forgive her any number of bad movies or unsympathetic characters here dana is not only clueless to her daughter's conduct she seems to be competing for the gold medal in the olympic indulgent mother competition br br it's possible that dana misses traci's murderous streak because truth be told traci seems to have the criminal skills of a hamster it's only because the script dictates so that she manages to pull off any kind of a body count br br a particularly hilarious note in this movie is the character of carmen a mexican maid who is described by dana as around so long she's like one of the family although she dresses in what the director thought would say i just fell off the tomato truck from guadalajara carmen is so wise to traci's scheming she might also wear a sign saying hey i'm the next victim sure enough traci confronts carmen as carmen is making her way back from mass and bops her with one of those slightly angled lug wrenches that car manufacturers put next to your spare as a bad joke i rather suspect than in real life those things are as useless as a murder weapon as they are for changing a tire br br in another sequence arquette wears a flimsy dress to a vineyard under cloudy skies talking to the owner cut to her in another flimsy dress under sunny skies talking to the owner's brother then cut to her wearing the first dress in the first location under cloudy skies but it's supposed to be later you get the picture we're talking really bad directing br br as for skin don't expect much although traci does own a nice couple of bikinis br br for those looking for a trash wallow 8 for anybody else 1 2
i loved this movie i'll admit it this has to be the best straight to video movie i've seen well me and my friend decided just for shits n' giggles that we'd rent this movie we knew what to expect and we got exactly what we expected plus more when that red neck gets slammed up against the tree by the sasquatch we literally watched that part about three to four times it was that amazing hysterically of course and why oh why does the main character have to roll that much like honestly we know that you're in danger rolling that much isn't gonna help all that much but really if this movie is in you're local video store rent it it is worth the money and it's not even that bad like it's bad but not incredibly bad overall complete amazing will be in store for you if you rent this movie
i'm dumbfounded yes that's right i'm really caught here no way did i find it awful but on the other hand it was a frustrating experience in macabre hysterical and murky incoherency the idea behind such a trim minimal low budget indie production isn't bad but it's a confused muddle and in the end didn't do anything for me it's amateurish and simple it wants to exploit beyond reasoning and do so in that of late fashionably rapid filming style we have the documentary laced hand held camera moving everywhere despite never leaving the van and sometimes feeling unfocused and blurry making certain details hard to figure out lately you kind of get use to it but there are times when it does become too distracting and even nauseating keeping it still will help the context has little groundwork which has five teenage girls on their way home from a football game late at night and becoming lost on the back roads at a road side store they become involved in a minor accident which smashes an unoccupied suv headlight scared they flee and not too long that one light suv appears behind them soon to make their night an unforgettable ordeal in terror spending most of the time playing out a drawn out noisy and relentless cat and mouse game br br as for being disturbing i guess that depends some moments can make you squirm with its attention to pain desperation and demented brutality with good use of piercing sound fx that seem to be more favoured over the imagery and not forgetting the alienating background sound effects but also i found myself snickering too in passages it can be repellent and intense with a real gradual rush but hardly believable the injuries of random characters never seem as serious like you were to believe despite obviously they should be watch how blood runs freely but it's not entirely convincing and can get dull the constant nocturnal car chase could only do so much before getting repetitive we get screaming spewing bleeding running cursing body fluids and so on quite unpleasant details followed too with little really to do it needed a much stronger script than the measly forced one that was penned up too many cringe moments arose from it and there was not much in the way of depth for the characters and situation they were in it was about set pieces waiting for next torturous encounter and it drew it out long enough helping out is it had an unpredictable pattern br br the performances jennifer barnett angela brunda danielle lilley sandra paduch and mia yi are workman like with their distraught characters and draw an authentic chemistry to make up for the script's weaknesses in its character foundation veronica garcia's flipped out bug eyed intensity as the loony driver of the suv was something yeah something her character's real motivation for terrorising the girls and her unstable state of mind is virtually non existent i guess being psychotic was good enough now probably the most unnerving thing i came across in the feature was that hideous soundtrack terrible techno music to cheesy hard rock and an overwrought closing score it never felt overdone or got in the way but it did stick out like a sore thumb co directors greg swinson and ryan thiessen try to get the most out of their slight resources but even with it edgy spirit it ends up being something quite ramshackle maybe it was enjoyable to make but watching it just wasn't the case
bellocchio refers to this as a mainly political movie a description of the revolutionary movement in italy but that seems more metaphor than reality well almost everything in the movie seems like metaphor the revolutionaries of whom we see and about whom we learn very little might as well be mafiosi out with the old and in with the new br br andrea's papa a psychoanalyst seems to stand for the usual traditional bourgeois values morally upright unperturbed clean and tidy thoroughly ritualized br br giullia the girlfriend of a revolutionary seems to represent what can happen to someone who needs very badly a cause to support but is unable to muster up the kind of devotion such a commitment demands i'm guessing here andrea the adolescent boy seems to be the only guy in the movie who is not in some unquiet way upatz he's respectful of his father but disobedient too he loves giullia or so we assume although he's not really old enough to have learned how to manage his reflexes optimally but he leaves her in order to show up at school and complete his final exams his course between these contradictory lifestyles could be described as media he's the man in between who knows the meaning of gradualism who can keep his cool while those about him are screaming br br most of this is summed up during the oral part of his finals when he is asked to translate and comment on an excerpt from antigone which contrasts the traditional authority of the gods with the notion of secularity and free will br br that brings us by no particular course that i'm aware of to marushka detmars she brings to mind a new yorker cartoon of a few years ago two hippos are neck deep in the river staring at a gazelle drinking from the bank and one hippo says to the other i hate her she's a good actress let me get that out of the way but so is everyone else in the film she carries with her in her speech and manner the rich glitter of outright lunacy and it all comes from the actress too not from directorial aid detmars isn't nuts the way catherine deneuve was nuts in repulsion the walls don't turn to rubber and grow hands instead we see her animated sometimes too animated and she gives us shocking jolts when her mood abruptly changes and becomes threatening the way a looming thunderstorm is threatening br br a critic described her as sultry but that's probably not the word he was searching for she's compellingly beautiful with her fluffy brown hair her wide white ready grin her impulsive giggles and her eyes are like the eyes in the paintings on the walls of ancient egyptian tombs the sexy parts are pretty erotic not so much because one of them is explicit but because we've gotten to know the characters involved it's more interesting to spy on the honeymoon couple next door than go to a skin flick actually there isn't that much sex there is only one scene of simulated intercourse but the director lets it play out in what seems to be real time at least real time for an eighteen year old boy br br the young man who plays andrea is fine too which is a necessary thing because the film depends almost entirely on him and giullia they have to carry it and they do if it were not for their performances i'm not sure this would be as interesting or as admirable flick as it is it could easily have been turned into a rather slow boring romance br br worth it
aka trinity is still my name this sequel looks like it was done to capitalize on the outstanding european box office success of they call me trinity only this time joseph e levine and avco embassy pictures wanted to capitalize on it in america as well too bad they didn't get very far since the hill spencer pictures have had only had marginal success here in the u s and this largely boring drawn out film doesn't help it out any br br trinity and bambino swear to their dying father harry carey jr that they will become successful outlaws and take care of each other they later get involved with arms traffickers who smuggle guns out of a monastery and who mistakenly think they're a pair of federal agents it all winds up falling flat in spite of a couple of funny scenes especially the one where trinity and bambino are in a fancy french restaurant and don't know how to carry themselves and the scenes with the card sharks was mildly humorous as well br br the opening title music sung by gene roman sounds like a fair bobby goldsboro like early 70s pop song while the music cues sprinkled throughout the movie are pretty good not sure if i'd want to buy the cd soundtrack of it but some others might br br the film could have had a half hour whacked off of it and it wouldn't have dragged on for so long it looks like a lot of scenery is being chewed up here in fact i lost interest in it about 2 3rds of the way through the dvd is also terrible with a constant hum in the soundtrack and a poor print that looks like it should have been sent to that great scrap heap in the sky br br a big step down from the previous film br br 4 out of 10
i found this very touching as spike and heaton stay together all the way through this film not to say there isn't a few betrayals along the way i thought the chase was put aside the relationship between the two was foreground i think i had already guessed that there were so gay intentions on the part of heaton my favourite scene had to be the bit where heaton and spike were stuck in the marsh and spike runs off i generally thought spike wasn't coming back i have to say that if it wasn't for our film studies teacher making us watch this i would have probably never seen it overall i thought this film was pretty good and i would recommend it to any person who is a fan of british made films
this light hearted comedy should be enjoyed for entertainment value it gets quite hysterically funny at times but if you haven't spent any time on 'that' side of the tracks you will miss the comedy when it erupts br br the cast of characters meld well together and are quite believable in their roles how grace handles meeting her dead husbands girlfriend was well played she's a true lady and my favorite is grace's white pimp suit that she wears br br i highly recommend this flick to anyone who wants to laugh out loud who cheers for the underdog or just wishes to watch something different
there is no question as to who is in command of the training of cadets in this film major chick davis pat o'brien o'brien plays an officer who adheres to military discipline in the creation of a new kind of soldier from his cadets the bombardier but he is not so rigid as to be unfair or unfriendly in fact he even changes his opinion as to the value of women working in the military he's tough when he has to be yet at other times he is a clear mix of coach and pastor roles he perfected in other films his character is the foundation of the action around which everything revolves o'brien seems natural in the role and plays it in fine fashion two things help this movie o'brien's performance and the spectacular special effects ending
this movie documents the harlem ball circuit of the mid eighties much more fun than than palazzo volpi though just as diseased this movie is a true gem of squalor one cannot help but sympathize with the characters because of their freakness the sole purpose of middle class intellectuals is to document the phenomenons of the trash and the glitz here the most genius of trash is extremely well documented and duly glamorized the characters' penchant for idolatry of all that is glamorous inspires even more adoration of the characters themselves on part of the viewer creating a phenomenon of a phenomenon effect which makes this movie a piece of art
if i could say it was better than gymkata i at least felt my money was not totally wasted br br then i saw steven segal's on deadly ground br br this movie should see a resurrection though on mst 3k if santa claus conquers the martians could make tom servo's head explode one wonders what mayhem this movie could cause br br there is a very good reason why kurt thomas never had a movie career br br the writers of this dreck should be forced to wear placards every day of their lives that say bitch slap me i was a writer on gymkata
this is one of the best bond games i have ever played because br br the missions are very very fun to play they have lots of action in them they can be really hard sometimes that makes it even more fun the weapons that you use are really good the cars in this game are really good the driving missions are fun to do this james bond game has a good story to it the voice over actors in this game are really good and it is cool that pierce brosnan is in this game and the way the characters look is really good because they look like what they look like in real life which is really cool also the graphics in this game pretty good br br overall score out of
very heart warming and uplifting movie outstanding performance by alisan porter curly sue i saw this movie when it was first released and enjoyed it immensely i just caught it again on the mplex channel and curly sue touched my heart again
i enjoyed this movie a lot i thought that the plot of the movie was realistic and relevant to anytime period in american history there is always that woman that does what she needs to do to climb the class system i feel that the character of lilly was portrayed correctly and could of not been done better what i enjoyed most was when she realized what love really was throughout the movie all of the men that fell for her were in love with her had given her everything even lost their careers for her until she had met cortland she did not understand why these men gave up everything for happiness the way her life had ended up was far from what she expected to be possible i'd recommend this movie to anyone of a mature audience so you are able to understand the content and the under laying meaning of the movie and plot
wowwwwww about an hour ago i finally finished watching this terrible movie i wanted to turn it off within the first like 10 minutes but i figured i'd give it a chance because it just hadddd to get better or at least have some redeeming qualities like i figured at the very least it would be a make you think type movie or like really intelligent or very well filmed or something needless to say that was not the case and i wasted about an hour and a half of my life im not even going to get into why its terrible because its a waste of my time to explain that this may contain spoilers imdb you should calm down on the spoilers thing and pay more attention to making sure that the people who rate the movies and comment are not paid to write good reviews or involved somehow in the movie or anything else like that i thought it would be humorous after this terrible film to come see hoe bad the rating would be and i was very very shocked to see the fairly high ratings all the ratings with about 7 10 stars clearly must be about some completely different movie im still a big imdb fan but seriously rethink this rating process because this movie should be rated no higher than maaaybbbeee like a 3
some unsuspecting films carry a message that resonates in the hours and days after viewing such is the case for carol's journey el viaje de carol a beautifully crafted 2002 film from spain based on the novel 'a boca de noche' by Ángel garcía roldán who also adapted the book as a screenplay war and its consequences are not new subject matter for films but when that war theme plays in the background as a subtle driving force to develop characters especially children who must face adult life influenced by the games of adults the result is a different and more tender examination of the coming of age film genre br br carol clara lago is a 12 year old spanish american youngster from new york who with her critically ill mother aurora maría barranco returns to her aurora's home in 1938 at the height of the spanish civil war a home that has been left deserted by her father don amalio Álvaro de luna since his wife's death carol's father robert ben temple is a fighter pilot who has sided with the republicans against franco and is rarely with his family aurora has a past she left her lover alfonso alberto jiménez to marry robert and alfonso in turn married aurora's cold sister dolores lucina gil carol is an independent girl who remains aloof to all but her grandfather don amalio until she meets others her age but not of her 'class' tomiche juan josé ballesta and his two friends at first resent carol but as events develop carol and tomiche are bonded by what feels like the first awakenings of love when aurora dies of her illness carol must live with alfonso and dolores and their daughter blanca luna mcgill yet turns to her grandfather for support and to her mother's best friend and teacher maruja the always radiant rosa maria sardà to understand the disparity between classes and the senseless war that keeps her beloved father from her side through a series of incidents carol and tomiche learn the rigors of becoming adults facing more traumas in a brief period of the war than most of us experience in a lifetime the ending though sad is uplifting as carol's journey to maturity is complete br br the film is shot in galicia and portugal and contains some extraordinarily beautiful settings captured with gentle sensitive lighting by cinematographer gonzalo f berridi and enhanced by the musical score by bingen mendizábal director imanol uribe understands the fine line separating pathos from bathos and in electing to concentrate the story on the children involved he makes an even stronger statement about the futility and cruelty of war the cast is exceptional the stars clearly are young clara lago and juan josé ballesta but they are supported by the fine veteran actors in the adult roles this is a visually stunning work with a lasting message and should find a much larger audience than it has to this date grady harp
my father dr gordon warner ret major us marine corps was in guadalcanal and lost his leg to the japanese and also received the navy cross i was pleasantly surprised to learn that my father was the technical adviser of this film and i am hoping that he had an impact on the film in making it resemble how it really was back then as i read in various comments written by the viewers of this film that it seemed like real life my father is a fanatic of facts and figures and always wanted things to be seen as they were so i would like to believe he had something to do with that br br he currently lives in okinawa japan married to my mother for over 40 years ironically she's japanese and a few years ago was awarded one of the highest commendations from the emperor of japan for his contribution and activities of bringing back kendo and iaido to japan since mcarthur banned them after wwii br br my father was once a marine but i know that once you are a marine you're always a marine and that is exactly what he is and i love and respect him very much br br i would love to be able to watch this film if anyone will have a copy of it and i'd love to give it to my father for his 94th birthday this year
i had some expectation for the movie since it had a nice star cast and it is the return of the duo of akshay and saif well i was hesitant to watch the movie because this was done by the same man who wrote the story for dhoom franchise because i hated dhoom 2 but if dhoom 2 is compared to tashan i would say dhoom 2 is very realistic br br when i saw the credits at the beginning i felt nice because it was put up in a nice way well the very first scene itself pis ed me off then the major drawback of the movie is the action sequences me and my friends were laughing our guts off watching this crappy fights it was like akshay against some 30 thugs and all and the thugs even got machine guns phew you got to see this to understand how bad the action sequences are br br the other thing about the movie is the far too predictable story it reminded me of some of the early 80's movies br br well the only thing the movie is worth is of sexy kareena who looked really hot in this one and for that i give a rating of 2 out of 10 br br guys please please don't see this one thinking that it is a real gangster movie well you can watch this to have some laughs at the terrible fight scenes br br thats all
finally i thought someone is going to do justice to h g wells's classic not another version set in the wrong locale or era but one based firmly on the book well it definitely follows the book pretty closely and that is the only plus to this mess br br this is 180 min's yes 3 hours long the book is only around 150 pages br br if timothy hines had the nerve to come on here and say if you can do any better i would say yes i could and i have never used a video camera or been to any sort or drama school in my life br br i paid good money to get this crap over to the uk from the usa do not make the same mistake as me
i've seen some crappy movies in my life but this one must be among the very worst definately bottom 100 material imo that is br br we follow two couples the dodds billy bob thornton as lonnie earl and natasha richardson as darlene and the kirkendalls patrick swayze as roy and charlize theron as candy in one car on a roadtrip to reno br br apparently lonnie isn't too happy with his sex life so he cheats on his wife with candy who's despirately trying to have a baby roy meanwhile isn't too sure if his sperm is ok so he's getting it checked by a doctor br br now i had read the back of the dvd but my girlfriend didn't and she blurted out after about 20 minutes 'oh yeah she's gonna end up pregnant but her husband can't have any baby's' spot on as this movie is soooo predictable as well as boring and annoying meaningless offensive terrible br br an example of how much this movie stinks the two couples set out in their big car towards nevada when they are stopped by 2 police officers as they didn't stop at a stop sign the guys know each other and finally bribe the two officers with a case of beer not only is this scene pointless and not important or even relevant for the movie it takes about 5 minutes it's just talk and talk and talk without ever going somewhere br br i still have to puke thinking about the ending though apparently roy isn't having problems down there so he is the father of the child how many times does that happen in the movies try something new the cheated wife ultimately forgives her husband and best friend for having the affair and they all live happily ever after yuck br br best scene of the movie is right at the end with a couple of shots of the grand canyon why couldn't they just keep the camera on that for 90 minutes br br one would expect more from this cast although thornton really tries but you can't really blame them writers shame on you br br 1 10
ayone who whines about how this movie was crap or that it had no plot must have been looking for jean de florrette hello this film was made to be a random act of comedy and in no way involves a plot in any way shape or form i would also like to remind these whiners that if you are going to flay the crap out of this film that they seem to be missing the point this film is clearly made for people who don't appreciate the so called american humour which seems to me just a pile of smutty crap the point is everyone has an opinion and you should be a bit more appreciative that some peoples sense of humour may not be in line with your own before shooting your mouth off br br thankyou
classic drama action western with incredible cinematography that is well ahead of it's time 1954 the production is very good and you can tell that it was done with pride and love unique peek into the american northt west pioneers is very educational and entertaining this movie is very under rated because most people do not like to see the reality that many lawmen during this particular time and place were very crooked corrupt much like most developing countries today the action sequences could have been more realistic though but still this movie really covers most of the essentials not for an audience who wants only pure testoterone type westerns for this movie is more for those who have a sense of history and philosophy
in a way corridors of time is a success story because the movie reaches its goal being seen by thousands but it fails at making them laugh br br les visiteurs has had its success because the subject was an original way of considering the time travel forget about zemeckis's back to the future here comes the old france the middle age knight and its nearly barbaric way of life full of pride funny thanks to the ancient words he uses montmirail can sometimes be disgusting but he keeps his honor then comes the sequel br br nobody had foreseen the tremendous success of les visiteurs the first and it's no use being a movie expert to realize that the corridors of time has been made for money br br the general story begins after the end of les visiteurs and immediately tries to justify the sequel with a time paradox that would have needed some second tought explanation it's no use trying to get back the jewelry jacquouille has stolen don't you remember this nice red shiny and expensive car he bought at the end of the 1st episode where do you think he found the money selling the jewelry and that's only one of many holes poiré tries to avoid and fails br br let's have a look at the characters montmirail doesn't change he's just a little more boring regarding frenegonde that's another story valérie lemercier decided not to compromise herself in this sequel to avoid getting stuck in the bourgeoise role and muriel robin tries to imitate her in a way that i found so pitiful i nearly felt pain for her and poiré doesn't realize that a cast of humorists isn't enough to make a good comedy br br forget about the time travels about the digital effects concentrate on the story and you'll see that there's enough room on a mail stamp to write it 10 times br br the main interest of this film is the landscapes a movie for youngsters let's say up to 13 years old
when you put this dvd into your player and hit play you will experience a brief moment of silence and see a black screen as the laser is guided to the correct starting point in the center of the disc cherish this moment make sure you have some tylenol or something preferably pm's so you can fall asleep because you're going to have a massive headache once this movie starts br br starring a bunch of big breasted girls and with an opening that actually made me chuckle a bit i thought i'd be in for a good time sure the opening sequence was a wee bit awkward and most of the jokes fell flat and it seemed like this was going to be a scream ripoff by the way my sole chuckle was from julie strain's final comment in this scene but then i knew there was trouble the opening sequence had a terrible rock song during this terrible rock song i looked over the dvd chapter titles and saw things that said topless in the backyard and better than sex i knew what the selling point of this movie was going to be br br and that's the sad truth the only good thing about this movie is the attractive cast other than that it's a sadly routine slasher film that throws in an innovative concept about murder clubs which ends up being fake anyway so the whole movie then points in another direction to try to be confusing and this huge mystery but it all just adds up to not being interesting at all and leaves you feeling like you don't care for any of the characters i mean when the main character of the movie is revealed to have murdered an innocent woman can you really feel any sympathy towards her when she's in fear for her life the scream influence is prevalent throughout with a ghost face killer and some really terrible jokes we're also treated to scenes of the main character talking to her mom and dad lloyd kaufman the only other cool part of the movie about an abortion or something uh yeah this isn't a so bad it's good movie it's just bad br br someone compared this to a troma film but you know most any film that comes from full moon or its offshoot as this film proves is horrible not horrible in a troma sense i've seen many troma films and i can honestly say they all offer something anything that you can walk away with and tell your friends about later however this film has pretty much nothing at all enjoyable about it beware
i just came from seeing this movie and decided to see what others thought of it i'm left wondering if these people who give glowing reviews saw the same film this is potentially a very good story but it fails to hit the mark the script is very weak the plot has so many holes that it would make a great dip net for the fishing scenes the characters were not well developed and the storyline jumps around so much that i found myself asking the question how did we get here at least a half dozen times during the movie br br there was a lack of any chemistry between the cast members this is probably related to lindsay lohan's antics during the filming it was pretty clear that everyone showed up and did their job but didn't commit to their roles br br this is not a movie worth seeing go for a walk play a board game take a nice warm bath and save your money for something that's worth it
an old man who lives in the mountains wakes up one morning and loses his cat he wanders the woods to witness a murder but did he see the murder or is he losing his mind is he just getting old the movie so great because the viewer has to make up their own mind on what is going on there is very little dialog in this movie but it doesn't need words the whole movie speaks for itself you knew what was going on and i liked it br br the other part that i liked were the shots of the woods in late fall and winter those were pretty but the only thing i didn't like was the view of the old man in his underwear he could have tied the robe a little tighter but other than that it was a pretty deep movie
koen wouters is a flemish singer and presenter in the early ninety's he tried his hand on movies as well but this unbelievable piece of junk ended his acting career once and for all it also ended the acting career of dutch actress nada van nie who went on being a football wife a tv presenter and program maker i actually did see this in an almost empty theatre because i used to be a fan of the band of koen wouters clouseau i so regret spending money on it it looks cheap it is a terrible story and it is executed bad in every possible way some people think it's so bad it's funny i am not one of them i just found it an incredible waste of time and money
this film is the culmination of everything that is bad about modern film unnecessary slow motion unnecessary flipping jumping somersaults unnecessary characters unnecessary dialogue basically unnecessity is that a word well it's just been invented by i robot br br what happened to practicality i e the car garage the skin spray the only tool that shows a combination of futuristic and realistic function is the card swipe at the coffee shop br br what happened to showing respect for women i e smith's character does nothing but degrade the doctor for the better part of the film and yet she still wants him where is the tension i'll tell you where good looks and not admiration or common ground br br what happened to a detective that detects smith did nothing but sit around and feel sorry for himself complaining to other people and when they said something that sparked a thought he was off this is such a lame way to get the story from point b c d etc it was ok once but not several times in a row speaking of several times in a row what was the i'm snoring and not listening to you joke twice in one scene br br what happened to the small parts in a movie being somewhat meaningful and not just a tool to promote rescue scenes shia labeouf the kid is in the movie for a total of two scenes we know that a he degrades women and b he knows smith so of course we should care about him and whether or not he comes to harm br br what happened to hero's let's just forget that there are people women and children everywhere getting attacked by robots and selfishly save the only person withing my view that i have an acquaintance with and why did he have to ramp his bike through the air showing off while the doctor was somehow able to reach the same distance in a matter of seconds on foot br br don't get me wrong i'm all for spectacle but i'm also all for a shred of realism and meaning br br i have to say i've never laughed quite so hard at a film in a long time so thanks alex br br i pray for the swing of the social pendulum back to simpler techniques simpler stories and simpler everything else in films but mainly simpler techniques br br big budget action films you so have to die
not since caligula have i considered turning off the movie half way through but then with this one i was only 15 minutes in when i considered unfortunately i did make it all the way through make sure that you do not br br it's not that cradle of fear is shocking or gory or scary or frightening or sexual it's that it's not any of those things yet it so desperately wants to be all of them instead it's boring trite ordinary predictable and unexceptionally poorly executed shot on video high school special effects no sense of even basic visual storytelling dialog barely audible not that it's worth hearing though br br this movie is proof for the argument that even the straight to video distributors need to draw a line in the sand somewhere
without a doubt one of the worst movies i've seen in recent years the story focuses on four women driven to robbing banks who we are somehow supposed to sympathize with it's tough to sympathize with characters who keep making such stupid decisions oh no the cops are on to us they know who we are what do we do let's rob one more bank then we're outta here what every character is a stereotype and it's easy to tell who's gonna end up dead
the charm of otto preminger's grandiose visionary film noir is that it has ambiguous intentions betraying the gloomy essence of the central character who is still vexed by living in the shadow of his criminal father dana andrews' driven vindictive cop is shown as an outsider irrational and destructive who maybe can change because he might've found a good woman to look after him the troubled man reclaims himself with his own tangled impression of rectitude the distressing mood permanently circuited into the latter half of the story by screenwriter ben hecht reverberates in andrews' tense performance as preminger saturates the film in a relevantly prosaic substance of style we don't just see and hear the city at night we feel it because preminger lets us see and hear even the most peripheral and distant factors of it br br dana andrews furnishes a complex character unfolded through his streaks of violence and the hatred that always infests him as the plot develops he is secretly entangled in situational snares yet he is renewed by the outward acts that can be seen in the vintage noir protagonist's visceral facial expressions before he executes them br br this reflection of a specific phase in the development of the genre is an engrossing feral and shady film noir that is set in the double dealing climate of the underworld where the hero is so estranged that he is always swelling with rage and even though he loses his rational resistance occupational principle and ethical limits he's still a good cop preminger just winks at telling a social conscience drama about a corrupted community within the sprawling cityscape rather keeping the thriller riding on andrews' shoulders as an existential journey of personal ramifications about a man with an oedipal fixation who is becoming disconnected though with the ever shrinking influences of the law on his side and an undying perception of right and wrong br br the production companies in the early 1950s pussed out on the social problem picture and rather made low budget low risk thrillers such as this apparently in an attempt to evade the conniptions of conservative critics and social busybodies but there is an expressionistic matter of factness to preminger's inimitable approach he injects each scene with a sense of everyday drama as a backdrop for the plot each supporting character must pull their own weight by doing something interesting but none of them are cartoons or depressing comic reliefs to him every character thinks they're the star as per the straight from the shoulder self assertion of karl malden as a missionary police inspector and a veteran waitress at a lunch counter it is those who are the stars andrews and gene tierney both anguished by their futile attempts to subdue their emotional intensity who don't want to be
this is just short of a full blown gore fest based on a stephen king story two tabloid reporters one seasoned miguel ferrer and one not so accomplished julie entwisle begin to believe that a serial killer michael h moss may actually be a vampire stranger than odd is this modern day blood sucker does not wing his way naturally but by way of a black cessna he seeks his victims the gore actually gets gruesome as the film nears its stupid finale keep in mind that mr king had nothing to do with this film i do admit it is a bit scary in the wee hours of the night
i saw this movie on comedy central a few times this movie was pretty good it's an interesting adventure with the life of sunny davis who is arranged to marry the king of ohtar so that the u s can get an army base there to balance power in the middle east some good jokes including sunnygate i also just loved the ending theme it gave me great political spirit ten out of ten was my rating for this movie
this is the most elementary sort of traditional ghost story not even enlivened to any great extent by the use of irish locations if the great m r james had ever come up with a tale this thin doesn't james in fact have a story called a thin ghost he wouldn't have bothered to have it published br br orson welles appears in the limp endpieces as a favour to a brace of old friends this film's producers his presence and the one movie industry in joke would have earned this will o' the wisp its oscar nomination this is yet more proof if any more were needed that the academy awards have never been any guarantee of merit
where would one start a review of the film snitch'd james cahill god rest his soul made one of the most daring insights into the human psyche since encino man his beautiful story unravels around a drug squad cop mcclure which is a name synonymous with a character from the simpsons who also happens to be an actor said cop delves deep into the underworld that is high school drug taking and discovers a gang war to rival that of police academy 1 and i mean the one where jones is racially vilified by his new partner but manages to come out with some of the funniest sounds you will ever hear br br cahill's grasp of effects both visual and aural is electrifying the slight pause between action on screen and from the speakers adds to the drama that is snitch'd a real gritty like underground thriller also kudos to his brilliant use of makeup such as the supremely convincing burn marks a gang member suffers in his showdown with an indoor barbecue yuck i feel the world of film is much less from james' passing his memory will linger on and on and on reborn with every passing mention of his flagship production snitch'd his insightful director's commentary released a coke hit up the nose of any discerning film goer truly appropriate with the harsh reality that is life on the streets captured in all the beauty of a roughneck punk knocking over a rubbish bin in a brawl br br but i ask you why did the big bosses swimming pool look so cheap i'll tell you why because thats life in santa ana baby its not all drive bys and hastily constructed principle's offices oh no there are some folk who must infiltrate the soft tattooed underbelly of street life in la to kick their way through in moves that would not seem out of place at a school for special children's production of double dragon the play br br the only qualm i have with this film is that there was never a sequel made come on steven spielberg come on george lucas come on guy that made revenge of the nerds 1 through 23 how hard could it be to step it up a notch and pay tribute to this great man james cahill br br he discovered eva longoria you know oh yeah that he did br br jonah
i watched the unrated version of this film and realised about 30 minutes into it that i was never getting my time back i persevered to the end hoping that the dialogue would improve the martial arts would look realistic eventually the special fx would actually look special i was so wrong i love horror i am a complete gore hound i number some of the eighties splatter flicks amongst the greats of the film world this however was not made in the eighties if this film had come out in the early eighties the fax could be forgiven for looking so bad it wasn't so it hasn't got that defence the dialogue is terrible with so many bad lines i was wincing at the writing rather than squirming at torture i don't like hostel never have i thought it was over rated over hyped and i felt nothing for the protagonists however it shines as a beacon to greatness next to this garbage the back of the cover for live feed promised a twist you would never see coming i'm still waiting for the twist that was promised
i wanted to like magnolia the plot reminded me of grand canyon which i liked 4 different lives stories that come together at the end but magnolia took a wrong turn halfway through the movie and i was lost i almost turned it off right then and there but i felt i should hang in there until the end little did i know it would be another torturous 1 1 2 hours thank god i rented instead of seeing it in the theatre i almost screamed out in frustration after 2 hours the biggest kick in the pants was the ending frog scene my dvd player still hasn't forgiven me and i don't blame it one bit it was a unique movie but a bad boring and pointless movie
i really liked this movie it was cute i enjoyed it but if you didn't that is your fault emma roberts played a good nancy drew even though she isn't quite like the books the old fashion outfits are weird when you see them in modern times but she looks good on them to me the rich girls didn't have outfits that made them look rich i mean it looks like they got all the clothes blindfolded at a garage sale and just decided to put it on all together all of the outfits were tacky especially when they wore the penny loafers with their regular outfits i do not want to make the movie look bad because it definitely wasn't just go to the theater and watch it you will enjoy it
in spite of sterling work by the supporting actors and an intelligent script by alan plater this film suffers from a fatal flaw the lack of charm of the central character actor one of the characters describes richard e grant's character as a whining little turd and unfortunately this sums him up perfectly there is nothing about him or his performance to make it credible that his girlfriend and upper class publisher friend would spend so much time and emotional effort on him he is rude arrogant selfish self destructive and thoroughly annoying the part called for an actor who can make you love him even when he is being a prate a ewan mcgregor for example br br all of the witty satire on the class system etc was wasted thanks to this irritating and thoroughly unlikeable performance all i wanted to do was shake him and tell him to get over himself
superman ii the richard donner cut should be a fan's dream come true at long last footage only seen in photos and scenes that only existed on the printed page would finally come to life a director that was unable to complete his vision would have the opportunity to have his vision restored it seems like a winning situation and then you start watching this assembly of footage and you realize this esoteric dream is a very real nightmare of sloppiness and incompetence while it's entirely possible that no movie could compete with the finished perfect version each of us has imagined over the years it really should have been a thrill to finally see this project and it is only a very few times br br you know things are shaky when the very first bit of text on screen looks like home brew computer graphics but then we start seeing new footage alternates from superman the movie for the trial and that first bit of hesitation fades away hey this is pretty neat things are alright for these few fleeting moments until we see footage from stm intermixed with new effects for this project and it doesn't convince at all and from this point on it never ever lets up it's probably not right to judge a movie because of bad visual effects but when this is supposedly the direct follow up to a movie whose tag line was you'll believe a man can fly it's difficult to believe anything shown on screen here the best effects in this are from the original productions br br another issue with this re cut a lot of it just doesn't make sense the only reason any of it really works is because we've all seen the theatrical version of superman ii a movie that does make sense lester's superman ii fills in the holes of this assembly part of this could be because donner didn't get to complete shooting the other part could be because the makers of this project were intent on using as little lester material as possible what we end up with is an assembly of footage that makes superman iv look airtight and coherent br br after viewing this one gets the sense that while lester was faithful and comfortable using donner material michael thau and his team were extremely disrespectful towards anything filmed by lester the best scenes in the donner cut are the ones lifted relatively intact from the released version of superman ii that includes the moon sequence and the diner sequence not ironically both were filmed by donner but anything else from that movie filmed by lester is re edited in such a hasty fashion that it now makes lester seem like a ham fisted know nothing while lester honored the donner material lester here is thrown under the bus br br so is there anything good in this release well marlon brando is in it and that's neat to see in fact watching any of the material shot by donner is neat since it was all filmed at the same time as superman the movie but that only highlights the problems of this release any of the major scenes really just lois jumping and scenes with marlon brando would have been better served as completed scenes in a deleted scenes section instead they are shoe horned into a nonsensical narrative with inferior performances many alternate takes from familiar scenes are used sloppy edits and bad decisions br br watch the opening scene at the daily planet why are we looking at jackie cooper's back as he calls for lois and clark at the end why do we have lois walking into her dark apartment only to have that followed by jackie cooper walking into a dark bathroom turning the lights on i was initially confused by this because i expected to see lois the entire assembly is filled with questionable choices like this br br battle scenes are a mess too with no geography between cuts it's just random action of course the major action scenes were shot by lester and his material is only used as a bridge to the next set of donner outtakes or alternates they should have used more of lester's footage but probably had too much pride to admit that br br the sloppiness extends to the military missile as well as noted elsewhere the missile shown in the donner cut bears the designation xk 10 while we all know it's the xk 101 a blind man in stm knows that the producers of this assembly who tried so hard to honor the original film dropped the ball less than five minutes in and that mistake is indicative of the quality of the entire production for all the supposed care that was put into this the final product has an air of shoddiness to it that is inescapable br br the entire affair would probably be easier to digest if warner's didn't make this a separate release here in the states as it is we're expected to pay for what is essentially a bonus disc of deleted scenes with a play all option it's really only worth one viewing so that we can finally see the legendary cut scenes but after that initial viewing i expect that this will be an excellent magnet for dust and little else i know after my experience of watching this i had new respect for lester's version it's by no means perfect but lester realized the deficiencies that were in the script that stand out here in bold relief he managed to make a movie that has entertained for many years and will continue to do so while this new re cut will most likely only be remembered as a footnote in that films history
this was incredible meaning that it was hard to believe that the forgotten tribe would make this astounding migration twice a year and that the filmmakers cooper and schoedsack didn't stage some of the scenes and shots but what shots they are the cinematography under mostly extreme conditions is brilliant and the score of iranian music added to the video release give this memorable documentary an added richness br br i had the pleasure of seeing this and kon tiki on the same weekend which was a thrill and certainly made me see how tough and hardy and brave people can be whether for primitive survival or the need for adventure or in the name of science
by some happy coincidence the same year that jimmy stewart and kim novak made alfred hitchcock's haunting masterpiece vertigo they also made this light comedy perhaps the two actors needed to do it after undergoing the heaviness of the hitchcock film at any rate this a great companion piece to vertigo as it again explores a very un likely but powerful romance in fact the film can be seen as the flip side of vertigo with it's happy ending here again novak undergoes a transformation in vertigo she essentially plays two women and here she 'transforms' from witch to mortal stewart is again bewitched and for awhile tormented by his love for her unlike vertigo the two come together in bell book and candle a perfect antidote for the hitcock movie again the dynamics of love and attraction are examined but in an altogether different vein the cast is terrific lemmon hilarious as novak's warlock brother and elsa lancaster giving a classic performance as the aunt ernie kovacs as the alcoholic cult writer and of course hermoine gingold playing novak's competitor are all great the scene with stewart drinking the potion is comedy at it's best anyone who has seen vertigo or even if you haven't should see this memorable light comedy
i saw this movie a long time ago luckily it was for free i have to be one of the maybe twenty people who saw this movie in the theater i don't remember a whole bunch of it but i do remember i was incredibly bored the plot made no sense and when i came out of the theater the only thing i could say was at least now i know what the worst movie i ever saw was i just was incredibly bothered by one thing if they can make the temperature as they approach the sun low enough for humans to survive why can't they turn it down to a comfortable temperature instead of being all hot and sweaty how stupid do they think we are
imagine the plight of richard a painter whose real passion is flying when we first meet him he is seen atop a building in london wearing his home made wings he has ripped his canvases and other works at the height of his despair and fashions a flying device for his jump when he falls into the protective police contraption he doesn't suffer a scratch but it lands him in front of a judge who orders him to do community service richard whose relationship with anne apparently ended badly decides to relocate to a rural area where he finds a place in the country with a large barn he plans to use to construct his own plane br br richard ends up trying to help jane harchard reluctantly she is a young woman suffering from a l s or lou gehrig's disease and is confined to a motorized wheel chair jane is extremely intelligent but has a dark side and a salty vocabulary she uses a hand held device to speak sometimes as her speech is not clear what jane loves to do is to lose her virginity at any cost jane and richard clash as they meet but a mutual tolerance soon makes them comfortable with one another br br jane who watches porn on her computer has a notion for finding someone like richard gere in american gigolo who will for a fee have sex with her when richard takes her to london they find the right man for the job his fee is exorbitant but they agree since they have no money richard decides to rob a big bank unfortunately things don't go according to plan when jane realizes that she can't go through with what she had wanted at the end richard takes jane for a ride in his crudely built plane for the thrill of her life something that brings them closer as they find an affinity with one another br br peter greengrass directed this quirky film which presents an unusual situation jane is clearly not the romantic heroine in mainstream films and yet she has such a sweet aura about her that is hard not to feel for her and what she is trying to accomplish mr greengrass shows an affinity richar hawkins' material he wrote for the film the movie doesn't try to be cute or give a rosy picture of a young woman afflicted with an incurable disease br br helena bonham carter is the main reason for watching the film she makes a wonderful jane on the other hand kenneth branagh doesn't seem too well suited for this type of comedy somehow he has problems of his own in the way he interprets richard gemma jones has some good moments as anne richard's former love br br the theory of flight shows a good director no doubt peter greengrass will go to bigger and better things
with the runaway success of god's army every mormon with a camera seems to be trying to make a movie now in the case of the recent the other side of heaven this wasn't at all a bad thing that film while not great was quite good the singles ward however is not br br telling the story of a young divorced mormon guy thrust back into single life the writing and shooting style of the singles ward is in many ways very similar to the 80s comedy ferris bueller's day off however the similarities end there while ferris bueller was funny original and well acted as far as stupid comedies like this ever are the singles ward is completely the opposite it tries very hard to be funny however 90 of the gags either fall flat or are cliches and jokes you've probably heard a million times before the other 10 seem to be thrown in to fill out the time and the acting while not awful is amaturish at best br br in addition if you're not either a mormon yourself or very very familiar with mormon culture you won't get hardly anything at all whereas god's army and the other side of heaven were appealing to a broad range of viewers both inside and outside of the mormon church this film is most definitely one big inside joke and even if you get it it's just not that funny
this is a great movie for all generation x'ers what a different world the america of 1972 was compared to our psychotic 21st century you can get a sense of what an 1972 america gone by was like by watching this movie i found that the clothing and the car styles brought back to me fond memories of a much better country than we have now just think back then there were only 4 or 5 tv stations to choose from there was no aids muslim terrorists road rage 911 bird flu freeway snipers etc etc the vietnam war was just over there will still be 7 years before star wars comes out the personal computer and internet would still be 29 years away br br when this movie first came out the producers had to market the film themselves as no other film company wanted it so it began touring small protestant churches around the country being shown on movie projectors this was the days before vcrs of course the pastor of a church who would would be interested in showing a thief in the night to his congregation would obtain a copy of the film then he would set up a evening to show it in the church meeting area or lunch room members of the congregation would invite unsaved friends and family members and it would be a social event of the week br br if you can get past the limited production values of the film and just watch it for its nostalgic value then i think you will enjoy the film more of course i am speaking as a gen xer br br if i had a time machine i would go back to 1972 and say goodbye to the 21st century cesspool we have now
how tasty was my little frenchman tells a story that is alternately sad scary and life affirming it ends with a brutal finale that you knew had to happen even though you were hoping maybe even beleiving it wouldn't br br utlimately this is the film's greatest strength it expertly plays with your emotions and expectations then drops a bomb on you br br i saw this in a film theory class at usc back in the mid '90s it is not easy to find but is definitely worth hunting for
note to all directors long is not necessarily good this movie is incredibly long however not good the scenes were drawn out way way way way way too long the sex scenes were unnecessary and often too long the movie edited down to 2 hours and 10 minutes or so would have been exceptional but alas it became so boringly long that i can only give it a 2 of 10 it is way below average br br some other problems also exist in this marathon br br 1 ralph fiennes plays a whole family tree the guy who played the great grandfather looks nothing like him but the grandfather father and the son who gives us constant unneeded voice over are all ralph fiennes with different facial hair and the same basic bull headed personality no one seems to notice that each of these children look like a clone of the last even though photos of them are being snapped at every turn this one is minor but if the movie hadn't been 3 weeks long it wouldn't have been so annoying br br 2 the fact that no news from germany was even whispered for the longest time about jews being rounded up and sent off is ridiculous some word would have gotten to them and the thought of trying to run off would probably have been discussed the uncle in france would surely have sent warning to try and get them to leave br br 3 the love stories in this movie are totally wrong you are spending forever telling us this thing and the development of relationships between main characters is extremely short suddenly people are in love and almost instantly married then having children then we draw things out for 6 centuries and forget about developing relationships this again would not have stuck out so much in a 2 hour movie but with time spent nothing was given to us br br 4 the ending was just bad i don't want to spoil it for anyone but you won't like it either unless you are sadistic br br the director writer should be tortured with having to watch this bloated garbage on a weekly basis i mean endless loop oops they are the same thing br br i wonder if robert redford did anything for this movie i mean i think istvan szabo must be modeling his directing career after him long drawn out movie which totally ruins any substance in the movie a short description of 'the horse whisperer' and sunshine br br sunshine perfect title if you start watching while the sun is shining it will quite possibly be well after dark when you leave
for long time i haven't seen such a good fantasy movie magic fights here are even better than in lotr even considering that it's a 1987 movie and haven't computer special effects this movie have good plot good acting and interesting ideas recommend everybody to see it
this agonizing comedy drama got surprisingly sterling reviews upon its release in 1979 i remember opening the movie section of the l a times and looking at a 2 page advertisement for chapter two filled with glowing captions like better than 'the goodbye girl' and neil simon does it again what does neil simon do he takes an autobiographical situation remarrying too soon after the death of a beloved spouse and makes it rusty unpleasant and worst of all unfunny james caan plays neil er that is george a writer who can't seem to get back into life after losing his wife enter spirited marsha mason real life mrs simon soon to be ex mrs simon who attempts to love george despite his moods and general melancholy mason is very appealing here and might've saved the day were it not for caan's indifference not to mention a sub plot concerning painfully thin blonde valerie harper which brings the proceedings to a screeching halt i liked mason's outburst at the end i am wonderful i am nuts about me but i saw no happy ending for these two people and time proved me right from
okay let me break it down for you guys it's horrible br br if roger kumble did such a fancy job on the first cruel intentions then why did he do such a bad job on this i'm sorry but this movie is stupid true it may have improved if its series was ever aired but lets be realistic this movie a crock a lot of bad acting note the shower scene kissing cousins what kind of line is that slipery when wet can we say duh m this movie had effort i'll give you that but it was too stupid they even tried to make it funny by giving the house servants stupid accents which actually wasn't funny it was pathetic not to mention that they made everyone in the this one look absolutely nothing like the original cast it's as if they made them look different on purpose or something i like watching it when i'm really really really board which doesn't happen occasionally for those of you who did like it okay what were you thinking could you possibly choose this movie over the other one which had great acting and the fabulous sarah michelle gellar a movie is gold if it has sarah michelle gellar in it duh but this movie doesn't no offense amy adams oh yeah since when does sebastain have a heart ugh
spoilers within br br it appears that von trotta was a lot more at ease with what the balance of personal story versus history of the events than she was in her earlier film versprechen das 1995 br br the direction seemed carefully controlled and visually i felt it was highly appealing especially where the visual narrative was concerned the title sequence blend and the lighting of a new candle in modern times commemorating the deaths of various characters in the past br br to clarify two points that many people have been confused by br br firstly lena did not sleep with goebbels although this may have seemed implied it was not the intent von trotta told me so herself and she is a very nice lady by the way br br secondly the time frame of events was in fact historically accurate the actual dates are shown on the close up of the memorial and the prisoners were released as suddenly as in the film there is evidence showing that goebbels was annoyed about having done this and had planned to eventually recapture those he had set free br br overall what most impressed me most was that it was an original story from a much 'over movied' era it seems a shame that it has taken such a long time for various reasons for this film to hit our screens br br more of the same please margarethe
i was hooked from beginning to end great horror comes from disturbing imagery and organic shocks that are created not to make you jump but to make you go what the f ck did i just see all the other commentators gave short summaries of what the film is about so i won't rehash what has already been said i was telling other people about this movie days after i had seen it just because it still haunted me i even had a bad dream after seeing it and i am a true horror fan not easily spooked by tripe like the grudge or even silent hill what gave me the bad dreams was the unease i felt about what i would do if i were in that cell with those guys what would my personal horror be my subconscious took me there and it was not pleasant that my friends is what a good horror flick does to you the best part of this movie is that it is subtle it's not about bogeymen that jump out at you alien invasions or tons of gore it's the opposite the horror you create in your own mind the irony for the four characters is that the horror comes not from an external force that asserts it's power over them simply the men ask for the one thing they desire and they get it but not in the way they imagined so on the one hand they get what they wish for from an occult book but may ultimately wish they hadn't sometimes being locked in a jail cell is the best place to be
i saw this film at a store in the cheap section i actually vividly remembered seeing the commercials and trailer for it years ago i thought what the hey' and bought it basically because the plot sounded interesting and claire danes has always been someone of talent in my eyes this was also before i became a huge kate beckinsale fan br br so it's about two girls who sneak off to a vacation in bangkok get busted for narcotics which they are innocent of and then are sent to a thailand prison the film follows what will happen to them and at times questions their innocence br br both claire danes and kate beckinsale give great performances and the plot of this film wraps itself up unconventionally and raises some nice moral discussion questions br br i think this is a solid good film but there could have been some improvements it could have been longer it would've helped to solidify these characters and more insight into the politics of thailand's justice system would've helped br br nevertheless other than that it's a good film with some great performances br br p s for all you pop culture junkies be on the lookout for a two minute role by paul walker i didn't even notice him the first time i saw the film
dark remains is a low budget american horror movie that somehow managed to win 2 awards br br the plot seems to involve 2 separate strands first a woman commits suicide by slashing her wrists whilst bathing second the young daughter of a technical writer is found with her throat slashed the grieving couple decide to move to an isolated cabin in the mountains it later transpires that the cabin and surrounding locations are haunted br br as the movie goes on the 2 separate strands of story eventually converge as one might reasonably expect however the execution is haphazard and results in confusion that could perhaps only be resolved by multiple viewings unfortunately the movie is simply not enticing enough to attract most viewers into watching it more than once br br just about everything that could go wrong with this movie goes wrong and fast and the low budget cannot be used to justify all of the shortcomings found here br br i believe it would be wrong to pass judgement on the actors involved in this production as the material was simply too poor br br the characters are uninteresting as pointed out by other reviewers on this site the badly written script introduces too many people without giving them interesting dialogue without creating opportunities for character driven situations and without adding depth to any of them br br the direction is uninspired the inspiration from j horror movies such as ringu the grudge and one missed call is evident unfortunately the directors of dark remains did not pay close attention to the style of j horror j horror works so effectively because it plays on fear of the unknown tension is created by constant shifts between a bizarre situation a ghost on a cctv camera walking towards it for example and the reaction of a central character who is faced with it without any warning there is no humour or tongue in cheek element in these movies everything is played so straight and without remorse or limitations that you can't help but be convinced and captivated by it the foreboding atmospheres set up the suspense and ensures the horror has psychological impact very much unlike the jump scares used in hollywood movies br br the directors of dark remains made a brave attempt to avoid hollywood clichés and also successfully avoided using cgi the homage to j horror could have been well intended unfortunately the lack of inspiration is likely to make the viewer laugh at the supposed scares on the screen the make up effects of the ghosts weren't too bad given the low budget but their actions just defied logic i was scratching my head quite a few times during this movie br br i couldn't give away the ending even if i wanted to i simply couldn't understand it all i could deduce was that it was something of an anti climax br br what remains the answer as a reviewer on a different website has pointed out is boredom the movie is a chore to sit through thankfully the pain ends after an hour and a half however most would probably switch off long before the end br br there are only 2 positive things i could find in this movie the successful avoidance of scare clichés and the absence of the f word in every single sentence like one would normally expect to find this is what the 2 stars are for br br those who like supernatural or psychological horror relating to ghosts and haunting might do well to stick to movies such as the legend of hell house the changeling or the j horror sub genre br br if you think you have seen too many established movies and want to see an obscure ultra low budget r rated horror movie about ghosts watch death of a ghost hunter it may not be the greatest horror movie ever made but it is surely a lot better than dark remains and does have a few genuine surprises in store br br i advise everyone to avoid dark remains like the plague
this is probably one of brian de palma's best known movies but it isn't his best body double the fury and carrie are better movies but this movie is better than blow out and obsession de palma is very influenced by hitchcock and this movie is a take off on psycho angie dickinson is a bored housewife who is thinking of having an affair and after her psychiatrist played by michael caine turns down an offer dickinson meets a man in a art gallery and she winds up sleeping with him after this point it's best you don't know what happens but there is a murder and nancy allen is a call girl who gets a look at the killer dennis franz is the detective on the case who really doesn't trust allen and she has to find the killer herself it's a pretty good movie but isn't one of de palma's best
lost is one of a kind its so enchanting and full of suspense thrill and emotions all at the same time i have never seen any tv series like this before it is full of jungle thrills and has a good screenplay the actors have emoted life on an island in such a natural way that i feel lost in the island myself while watching it it is an excellent piece of work narrated in a very intelligent form the series is like a movie depicting the life of the survivors lost on a deserted island i am tempted to watch one episode after the other and i highly recommend this series for all the tv show lovers watch it to see the magic of being lost in nowhere
i thought king solomon's mines was beautifully done my only reservation was alison doody her acting was superb but her makeup and hair was not of the period and always seemed to make her look out of place next to the other actors i thought patrick swayze was an excellent choice for alan quatermain it was nice seeing a seasoned rugged looking actor in this role after sitting through movie after movie with the fair haired fair skinned actors like val kilmer brad pitt etc he was an excellent choice and i enjoyed every minute of this movie this version cannot be compared with the 1950's version with stewart grainger it was a big screen movie and not a made for tv movie i thought both quatermains were believable but the two medias have to be kept separated i am looking forward to seeing this once more and i hope patrick swayze will again look to these type of roles
never viewed this film and consider it a great classic with great veteran actors in the period that this film was made people in america were different there was no tv or all the modern things we have today except the radio and the starting out of great films being made in hollywood sweet innocent tales of young romance between a young girl or guy was viewed differently than it is today ann shirley murder my sweet '44 played a young orphan gal who was called carrot top because of her red hair and found herself being taken into a home of two elderly folks who were like two wise owls and watched over ann shirley it was a small town and everyone knew everyone and if anything happened the entire town found out about it within minutes it is a down to earth film with nice decent people trying to help each other in a very very simple way of living today it seems very corn ball and stupid but believe me this was the way people were in america during the 1920' 30's and they were a great generation that loved good family films
this was one of those films that got a ton of play on the airwaves in the early 1970's usually on the 4am movie or one time on the 7 30 pm channel 6 big movie and still another on creature double feature when local channels used to run movies as part of their local programming mostly gone today in favor of infomercial time it was of the time a couple of low rent abbott and costello wannabees frankie ray and robert ball are in a platoon of soldiers half a dozen guys in army surplus remainders who are sent on field maneuvers to look into some strange radiation and wind up encountering extraterrestrials they first go into bronson canyon to what would be later the famous batcave on batman and encounter the remains of a dead carrot monster later in the cave they're chased by a living carrot creature basically a guy in black suit and paper mache head with sparkly things on it and ping pong ball eyes two of them complete geeks ray and ball are captured and wake up tied to tables and are being examined by space amazons dr poona nooo kidding and professor tanga who are stunningly beautiful and even moreso in their skimpy bikini uniforms we were too young at the time to realize what later bondage and fetish scenarios this examination scene would more than suggest turns out that the two gals and their carrot monster are stranded on earth with a ship that's well hidden and are trying to return to their world br br the film was made as a total comedy with varying degrees of taste but remember this was of the time when eric von zipper and his crew from frankie and annette's films were the height of b film drive in comedy so it only seemed a natural to jump on the bandwagon for some quick bucks br br for some reason i only thought i'd imagined seeing this film to start with no i really saw it and when it was released on restored dvd i was assured in my memory the comedy goes from mildly funny to just plain stupid but whatever the budget is non existent which is a minor miracle when you think about it that it even got made and we can talk about a restored version here and now over 40 years later the payoff is the girls who want to learn about love and kissing and the upshot is the geeks which all of us were get the girls and love wins out it's just goofy and silly and for the locations has nostalgic significance
this film sat on my tivo for weeks before i watched it i dreaded a self indulgent yuppie flick about relationships gone bad i was wrong this was an engrossing excursion into the screwed up libidos of new yorkers br br the format is the same as max ophuls' la ronde based on a play by arthur schnitzler who is given an inspired by credit it starts from one person a prostitute standing on a street corner in brooklyn she is picked up by a home contractor who has sex with her on the hood of a car but can't come he refuses to pay her when he's off peeing she answers his cell phone and takes a message she runs away with his keys br br then the story switches to the contractor who pays a professional call on a rich bored new york woman who plays with him until he is aroused then she pulls away she tells him how desperate and unhappy she is he tells her how beautiful she is and lucky as he is leaving she asks if he would have sex with her she sits on top of him bounces up and down this time he comes the he leaves br br the woman and her husband throw a dinner party for their trendy friends hubby robert is talking business wife ellen is bored and switches the subject to sex and how often men and women think about it husband switches conversation to desert later after the guests leave ellen tries to entice robert into sex robert wants none of it and puts on a jazz record ellen turns on the radio robert turns up the music ellen turns on the tv robert turns on another tv cacophony ensues ellen goes up on the roof robert joins her ellen confesses that she needs to experience more men men other than robert robert says that he too needs to experience men br br we next follow robert as he visits an artist martin played by steve buscemi i wish buscemi could have more roles like this where he is a sexy smart totally desirable guy robert praises martin's work much more than it deserves promises to get it into a show martin is excited until it turns out that robert is speaking out of his groin it is all a mating dance robert tries to kiss martin on the lips and martin pulls back saying that he is not gay robert asserts that he's not gay either martin scoffs both admit that the artworks are bad robert is about to leave when martin allows robert to kiss him they make out and robert goes down on martin br br next we follow martin as he prepares for an art show at a manhattan gallery he is smitten by the receptionist anna played by rosario dawson i had to cut some of this review to keep it under 1000 words and they make love to each other br br we next follow anna who is sitting at a lunch stand her boyfriend nick adrian grenier enters bearing flowers she is cold toward him he tries to figure out why he coaxes out of her the information that she has had sex with someone while he was in san francisco she coaxes out of him the fact that he has stayed with his ex gf while in san francisco and had sex with her the latter revelation turns out to be a lie the two of them make out in the luncheonette but she decides that they must break up nick is heartbroken br br and we follow nick who confesses his troubles to an older woman who he meets on a park bench joey carol kane joey is sort of weird and child like but is a good audience for nick who needs a sympathetic ear the two of them go to coney island at night and look at the stars nick falls under joey's spell despite the age difference between them they go back to joey's apartment and nick gradually realizes that he is about to have sex with a crazy old woman she is on top of him doesn't want to let him go but he manages to escape br br this is by the way the best carol kane role since she played latke's wife in taxi joey's phone rings and it is a man calling the psychic friends network and joey is one of the psychic friends although she is still hurting from nick she gradually gets into her psychic shtick the man is at his office late at night and wants to have phone sex with her although that is not joey's business joey goes along and coaxes the man to come she wants to keep talking although the man want to get off the phone and finds out that he has embezzled a lot of money from his company and will be found out tomorrow his life is ruined joey realizes that the man is going to commit suicide and she tries to make him believe that she is his friend that she cares about him and she does care about him br br but the man packs a gun into his briefcase and goes off to seek a prostitute on the brooklyn waterfront and we come back to the beginning to the same prostitute who started out la ronde she wants to give him 75 000 in cash if she will kill him he tried to kill himself but couldn't do it the prostitute does not want to do it but he insists holding her hand holding the gun inside his mouth telling her where to aim eventually the gun goes off and we see the prostitute walking down the street and arriving at the corner where she normally does business the contractor who didn't pay her earlier in the movie drives up rolls down the window they look at each other the end
i don't know what would be so great about this movie even worse why should anyone bother seeing this one first of all there is no story one could say that even without a story a movie could be worth watching because it invokes some sort of strong feeling laughter cry fear but in my opinion this movie does not do that either br br you are just watching images for 2 hrs there are more useful things to do br br i guess you could say the movie is an experiment and it is daring because it lacks all the above but is this worth 2 hrs of your valuable time and 7 eur of your money for me the answer is no
i must say that i really had no idea that i was going to sit down and watch this movie i guess it was the fact that i had nothing better to do between class but for once a tv movie caught my interest more importantly helen hunt caught my eye i really wasn't a big fan of hers prior to this film sure i liked twister and as good as it gets but something about this movie really did it for me i would now see myself as a huge fan this movie comes with high marks from me give it a chance it won't let you down
the film begins with a bunch of kids in reform school and focuses on a kid named 'gabe' who has apparently worked hard to earn his parole gabe and his sister move to a new neighborhood to make a fresh start and soon gabe meets up with the dead end kids the kids in this film are little punks but they are much less antisocial than they'd been in other previous films and down deep they are well meaning punks however in this neighborhood there are also some criminals who are perpetrating insurance fraud through arson and see gabe as a convenient scapegoat after all he'd been to reform school and no one would believe he was innocent once he was framed so when gabe is about ready to be sent back to the big house it's up to the rest of the gang to save him and expose the real crooks br br the dead end kids appeared in several warner brothers films in the late 1930s and the films were generally very good particularly angels with dirty faces however after the boys' contracts expired they went on to monogram studios and the films to put it charitably were very weak and formulaic with huntz hall and leo gorcey being pretty much the whole show and the group being renamed the bowery boys because angels wash their faces had the excellent writing and production values and hall and gorcey were not constantly mugging for the camera it's a pretty good film and almost earns a score of 7 it's real close in fact while this isn't a great film aesthetically it's sure a lot of fun to watch so i will give it a 7 sure it was a tad hokey particularly towards the end when the kids take the law into their own hands and reagan ignores the bill of rights but it was also quite entertaining the dead end kids are doing their best performances and ronald reagan and ann sheridan provided excellent support sure this part of the film was illogical and impossible but somehow it was still funny and rather charming so if you can suspend disbelief it works well
a recent viewing of that's entertainment has given me the urge to watch many of the classic mgm musicals from the forties and fifties anchors aweigh is certainly a lesser film than on the town the songs aren't as good nor is the chemistry between the characters but the film beautifully interweaves classical favorites such as tchaikovsky and the scene at the hollywood bowl with sinatra and kelly emerging from the woods above it at the top and then running down the steps while dozens of pianists play on the piano is the best scene in the film even though the scene in which kelly dances with jerry mouse is more famous classical music enthusiasts will no doubt identify the music the pianists are playing sinatra then croons i fall in love too easily before having his epiphany about whom he loves the color is beautiful hollywood looks pretty with its mountains and pollution free air can you imagine hollywood in the twenties let alone the mid 1940s and the piano music is absolutely glorious mgm certainly had a flair for creating lyrical moments like these
this movie is nothing short of a dark gritty masterpiece i may be bias as the apartheid era is an area i've always felt for but i'd say it ranks right up with cry freedom and cry the beloved country sadly up until a few days ago i'd never even heard of this movie inside is one of the most underrated films of all time probably because it was a small film company i'd never even heard of it before eric stoltz one of my favorite actors anyway is believable and dramatic nigel hawthorne plays his dastardly role well do not look for humor in this film there is none it is real savage and gritty to the last and to the sensitive i'd say bring a box of tissues but movies as great as this make you wonder why is it that the greatest films are often never heard of
dvd has become the equivalent of the old late night double bill circuit the last chance to catch old movies on the verge of being completely forgotten like the border there were great expectations for this back in 1982  a script co written by the wild bunch's walon green jack nicholson in the days when he could still act without semaphore and a great supporting cast harvey keitel warren oates valerie perrine tony richardson directing although he was pretty much a spent force by then  but now it doesn't even turn up on tv the material certainly offers a rich seam of possibilities for comment on the 80s american dreams of capitalism and conspicuous consumption with nicholson's border patrolman turning a blind eye to the odd drug deal or bit of people trafficking to finance his wife's relentless materialism until he rediscovers his conscience when he finds out his partners are also in the baby selling business unfortunately he never really gets his hands dirty barely even turning a blind eye before his decency rises to the surface the film feels always watered down as if too many rewrites and too many committees have left it neutered and sadly the recent dvd release is a missed opportunity to restore the original nihilistic ending where nicholson goes over the edge and firebombs the border patrol station that was cut after preview audiences found it too downbeat but which still featured prominently in the film's trailers br br while that probably wasn't too convincing considering how low key nicholson's crisis of conscience is in the film it had to be better than the crude reshot climax where the film abandons logic and even basic rules of continuity at one point he's holding characters at gunpoint then he's somewhere else and they're free trying to kill him one character goes from injured at his house to hopping around like a gazelle on the banks of the rio grande while valerie perrine's character gets dumber on an exponential level the villains of the piece are disposed of with absurd ease and one impressive car stunt in time for a clumsily edited happy ending and you start wondering if you somehow found yourself watching another film entirely what makes it all the more clumsy is that the rest of the film is so flat and underwhelming that the sudden lurch into melodrama is all the more jarring unfortunately ry cooder's beautiful title song across the borderline says it all much more economically but if you want to know the film's real crime it's completely wasting the great warren oates in a nothing bit part when even he can't make an impression you know something's really wrong all in all all too easy to remember why i found this so forgettable at the time
recently a friend and i were discussing educational and ethical influences when we were growing up in the 1950's versus today she mentioned samuel taylor coleridge who in 1798 wrote the rime of the ancient mariner both of us had been required to recite parts of the epic poem in high school and in english literature courses in college my friend said its messages even might be called metaphysical within today's context br br we tried reciting it and only remembered bits and pieces i have problems remembering dr seuss i said i'd get two copies of the poem so each could read it that was easy enough but i was extremely surprised to find it had been made into a film we looked forward to watching the film to see how it had been interpreted after all the rime of the ancient mariner isn't exactly light reading after each had read the poem we watched the film together br br we considered the film a remarkable achievement especially considering it was made in the 1970's before computers before the so called ken burns effect and before special effects too often began compensating for a lack of substance particularly noteworthy are the 19th and 20th century illustrations culled from lesser known artists such as willy pogany the early hollywood designer br br the film is narrated by sir michael redgrave whom had taught the poem when he was a schoolmaster adding a tone of authority and credibility in remaining true to the poem br br its mastery is in the layers of subtle messages conveyed without instructing or becoming an oppressive and obvious morality tale we found it such a refreshing change from today's 'in your face' and 'clobber them over the head' mentality most of today's morality messages in film are two dimensional extreme violence murder and mayhem mark the bad the bad are really really bad and good are super heroes it is as if human character lacked any nuance the rime of the ancient mariner is a celebration of the individual of character of an appreciation for celebrating all the richness life has to offer within the larger context of humanity i e man's capacity to give to others br br proud of ourselves for having found this unknown gem we then learned it had won the top award in its category five out of six times at name international film festivals another surprise was learning the film's director raul dasilva is a recognized authority on early animation and authored six award winning books about film br br this film's message is just as relevant today if not more so than when coleridge penned the original epic poem and when raul dasilva translated it to film if i still was teaching high school which i did for five years i'd grab this one and show it to all my students there's a level of richness here that naturally leads to discussion about the big and important issues all of us face whether in 1798 1978 or today in fact as long as humanity has a spiritual component br br highly recommended
the story would never win awards but that's not what it's about the script was just entertaining and suspenseful enough to make room for the incredibly choreographed fight scenes who needs a story with fighting like that really it's worth watching for that reason alone if you can handle the gore of which there is a lot none of it done realistically enough to be tough to look at i gave it a 7
it is a pleasure to see such creativity on tv again this show is poetic artistic and good fun the characters relate well and the writing is not bad i think it will improve as they get their legs definitely worth a look br br the girls steal the show so far in this series chuck is adorable as is olive the two aunts are a delight i sincerely hope they write them into bigger parts as they are magic br br well that's all the news that is fit to print go make yourself a big bowl of popcorn and enjoy something fun in an old fashioned way this is like dr seuss for adults
very slow paced but intricately structured and ultimately very touching a nice very true to life look at a small florida beach town in the dead of winter i've been there and this is absolutely accurate br br it's also the debut feature of actress ashley judd and she makes a big impression here it's hard to believe this film is 12 years old i remember seeing it in theaters and i recently rented ruby again except for the 80's looking clothes it has held up very nicely ashely is so radiant and touching here that it's hard to think of her subsequent career without wincing boy talk about failing to fulfill your early promise anyone seeing ashley here in ruby in paradise would assume this elegant natural beauty went on to all kinds of interesting art films and serious acting instead she has become the go to girl for dumb action films and slasher movies very disappointing but at least we have this lovely performance preserved to showcase her early promise br br as some other commenter's say this is not for everyone as it's very slow paced this is not an action film nor is it really a romance the director victor nunez ulees gold another excellent character study treats this ordinary young woman's life with deep respect allowing her story to build slowly and with a lot of detail in that way i think this is one of the most moving and respectful coming of age stories about young women that i can recall it's not about ruby's sexual awakening or how she lost her virginity but about her life choices and her growing maturity br br a lovely film if you take the time to watch it i think it would be a really excellent film to show teens and young girls or boys for that matter and give them a chance to think about and discuss it br br particular kudos to director nunez who also wrote the script which is so realistic and nicely detailed that i assumed all through the movie that it was based on a female written novel or memoir but in fact it's mr nunez's original work rated 8 out of 10
paulie sounds like the most saccharine lachrymose and sentimental garbage you could ever find yet it's actually much better than you might expect the daftness of the plot could so easily have set the tone for the whole film but actually in most other departments the film is charming br br in case you're wondering paulie is a parrot bought for a little girl with speech difficulties paulie becomes her best friend and goes everywhere with her he even sits on her shoulder during speech therapy lessons and eventually becomes a super intelligent speaker himself however paulie is sent away by the little girl's mother and he spends the rest of the film trying to get from n y c to l a to be re united with her br br so why does this awful sounding film succeed relatively well firstly it boasts some interesting and impressive animatronic effects secondly and far more significantly it has the courage to embrace its ludicrous premise and tells a genuinely moving often humourous story without worrying too much about the obvious flaws in the storyline thirdly it has several surprisingly strong performances including jay mohr as a wily crook gena rowlands as a kind old lady and cheech marin yes the dope smoking cheech marin as a musical immigrant it might not be a classic but paulie is sound entertainment for kids of all ages
in this documentary we meet roger the rich manager of a factory in china that makes beads and other trinkets sold and traded at mardi gras in new orleans roger claims the factory girls love their work and are grateful for the opportunities it provides but interviews with four of them tell quite another story the girls' bleak lives are shown in stark contrast to the bizarre excesses of mardi gras itself filmmaker david redmon should be lauded for getting excellent and rare footage of everyday life inside a chinese factory compound and for landing a revealing on camera interview with the head of the u s company that imports and sells the beads the movie is compellingly told and clearly serves its purpose as a window into what lies behind those ubiquitous made in china labels
well i'm blowed a woody allen film that i walked out of after half an hour i'm aware of the moral fragility of commenting on a film of which i've seen less than half but i hope you'll understand why basically it became apparent very early on that we were going to be patronised from the screen with a script that set out its conceit as if with bullet points a cast that were all trying to be characters from hannah and her sisters with the exception of chloe sevigny and were badly directed into doing so and a camera that sat around portentously only for there to be nothing to film but chat and the actor delivering it drama none it's partially pre narrated but the action does nothing to develop a dramatic situation br br maybe i did leave too early in this case but by then i'd decided against another hour and a half of one liner allen clones the script has its funny moments  i went almost entirely on the back of will ferrell's excerpts in the trailer trailer hooked again doh  but there's little pace to let them fly off nonchalantly as is best worse than this there's no fluidity saying this film's wooden makes a forest look like a jelly the opening café bound discussion being the most abject case in point the only thing that should be done by numbers is potted reviewing  2 10
you know this is gonna be a cheesy movie when br br 1 it was made it the 50's 2 it's in black and white 3 it has no name actors 4 screaming makes up for the lack of special effects br br well not to be outdone this movie brilliantly incorporated all four of the above elements to turn this into a true cinematic blunder br br okay shhhhh but i am gonna discuss special effects here or lack of them br br did you catch the underwater scenes it looks like it was poorly filmed through an aquarium note the cape flapping in the breeze br br and the repeated re use of stock footage exterior house shots the bridges scenes great enhanced the k r a f tiness of this film not since plan 9 have i seen such creative usage of stock footage br br and hey where there was a lack of special effects not to worry screaming does take the place of special effects in this movie as well yes this movie even cleverly used that old hack trick br br grab the popcorn set your brain on stun several fermented beverages definitely helps sit back and wonder why the heck did they put this on film again br br wayno br br
emma is a true romance if you love the soppy stuff charged with wit and folly you will love this movie its true to the novel which is very important with a few twists added for pleasure gwen is not one of my fave actreesess but she does justice to a role that required everything that she had to offer in spades she shines in a role i think no other actress could have done proper justice to br br jeremy northam as the hero how shocked are you i never looked upon him as overtly handsome but heck what the right role can do for you he looks so good as the sensible regal mr k that i am literally looking at him in a new light he makes and excellent romantic lead the charm and character that he brings to his role is wonderful br br ewan mcgregor greta sacchi brings in the rest a good cast a good movie if you are a fan of jane austen see this movie along with pride and prejudice and most importantly buy the books it enhances the movie to heights that are extraordinary
i discovered this movie on ifc and i thought it would be interesting for tiny love stories some of the stories really dragged on in this movie the fact that none of these women had names almost makes you suspect that the actresses were talking about their own real sex lives including kathy baker and alicia witt i have to admit i want to start seeing some more romantic views of first sexual encounters again like in strike 1998 when odette sinclair's acquaintances started asking about her presumed first time and tweety asked was it beautiful br br some might think re enactments and flashbacks would improve this movie i think it would make things even worse it doesn't necessarily have to be hardcore porn to get my attention but somehow i just expected more
the movie was disappointing the book was powerful the views and the learning of little tree were powerfully portrayed in the book the movie just coasted along and finally dribbled away still a nice tale for kids
have just seen the australian premiere of shower xizhao at the sydney film festival the program notes said it was a perfect delight deftly made touching amusing dramatic and poignantly meaningful i couldn't agree more i just hope the rest of the festival films come up to this standard of entertainment and i look forward to seeing more chinese films planned to be shown in sydney in the coming months
kudos to director and cast for such a realistic film the grittiness lack of glamor and desperation drew me into the film and kept me there i was truly impressed by how dates and information were relayed within the film ie newspapers letters etc it kept the film moving at such a fast pace i didn't feel the urge to fast forward once personally i thought all the principles did a tremendous job it was great to see bosworth and kudrow in such difficult roles it made me want to cry at times val kilmer didn't surprise me his performances of this nature usually leave me in awe overall this is a brilliant film not to be missed
that's right you heard me i am a huge fan of james patterson i own 10 of his books and i have read the entire series about lindsey boxer in my opinion the screenwriter should be shot br br what right did any film maker have to slaughter a terrific work of fiction and make it into a mockery of the mystery genre if i ever thought that harry potter was butchered then michael o'hara has proved me wrong br br i can only pray that the next screenwriter who tackles this fabulous book will do it a great deal more justice to michael o'hara and russell mulcahy don't quit your day job
this film is a wonderfully simplistic work enjoyable from start to end it is both sad yet uplifting at the same time the performances from miranda otto oh how she deserves so much more recognition and george del hoya are beautiful and yet almost painful to watch as the two tortured souls come to understand each other the supporting cast of workers at the dead letter office are wonderful bit parts in them selves as is alice's long suffering boyfriend who i couldn't help but feel slightly sorry for there's one particular scene i could watch over and over and i have it's such a shame that films like these don't get recognition and therefore bring them futher into the public eye for more people to enjoy i cried i laughed and i sighed i'd recommend this film to anyone
bette midler is indescribable in this concert she gives her all every time she is on stage whether we are laughing at her jokes and antics or dabbing our eyes at the strains of one of her tremendous ballads bette midler moves her audience if you can't see it live which is the best way to see bette then this is the next best thing an interesting thing to look at is how incredible her voice has changed and matured over the years but never lost its power her more vocally correct version of stay with me never loses anything in spirit from the rose or divine madness here it is just more pure and as heartfelt as ever i will treasure this concert for a very long time
it is hard to describe bug in words it is one of those films that truly has to be seen to be understood it follows a narrative that is more fluid and interesting than anything i have seen lately in a hollywood release as its characters react to the chain of events in different ways and as the events dictate different paths for the characters to follow the audience is merely an observer the almost proustian narrative flow of thought to thought the very spontaneity in the script will have you glued to the screen waiting anxiously to see how it all works out in the end and as far as the thematic elements there is a particular sequence in the film that goes from melancholy to bright and beautiful and then to tragic all within the span of about a minute and it works br br this movie is pure magic it reminds one why independent film is perhaps the brightest star the film industry currently has perhaps with more movies of bug's quality people will start to take notice
sydney lumet although one of the oldest active directors still got game a few years ago he shot find me guilty a proof to everyone that vin diesel can actually act if he gets the opportunity and the right director if he had retired after this movie a true masterpiece in my eyes no one could have blamed him but he's still going strong his next movie already announced for 2009 br br but let's stay with this movie right here the cast list is incredible their performance top notch the little nuances in their performances the real dialogue and or situations that evolve throughout the movie are just amazing the time structure of the movie that keeps your toes the whole time blending time lines so seamlessly that the editing seems natural flawless the story is heightened by that although even in a normal time structure it would've been at least a good movie drama thriller i can only highly recommend it the rest is up to you o
woody allen's second movie set in london tha tarot card murderer is killing prostitutes in london aspiring journalist sondra pransky scarlett johansson gets a tip that he may be lord peter lyman hugh jackman she starts to romance him but quickly falls in love she's helped by stage magician sid waterman woody allen who doesn't like what he sees br br i like this better than the over rated match point from last year it was shorter and moved much more quickly the plot is old but i was entertained and it kept me guessing till the very end it's not really a comedy but a mystery with a few very good comedic lines all from allen of course it's not one of allen's best but it's far better than his worst br br the acting is for the most part very good allen is bad but he's played this character a million times before and it's gotten tiresome but johansson and jackman are just great they look fantastic and give two very appealing believable performances also allen surprisingly works on their sex appeal there is a sequence where they're both in the their bathing suits to show off their nice bodies the only real debit is that allen still seems unsure on how to shot london he's not as off as he was on match point though maybe he'll just get better as he goes along br br worth seeing i give it an 8

the wife of a stage producer in london hopes to fix up the american song and dance man starring in her husband's latest show with an acquaintance an american girl who makes her living modeling fashions in society circles unfortunately the couple has already met on their own with the girl thinking the guy is actually the show producer married to her friend the fact he's not wearing a wedding ring should have discouraged any misunderstandings wafty fred astaire ginger rogers musical is eventually dragged back down to the earth by dwight taylor and allan scott's idiotic script which is full of juvenile behavior astaire and rogers don't just 'meet cute' they meet ridiculously he's tap dancing like a madman in the hotel suite above hers and she complains audiences of 1935 probably didn't care how these two were going to get together as long as they did so and happily seen today the central characters appear to have no motivation to end up in each other's arms he plies her with flowers after telling his friend he wants to remain fancy free in the love department and she gives him the brush off nothing that a little dancing couldn't cure this glamorous twosome are as deliberately unreal as are the london and venice settings but we watch simply because the leads are fred and ginger it's a fantasy for have nots ones who don't mind the dumbed down plot the musical moments do break up the monotony of the contrived scenario yet fail to transcend the surrounding silliness from
well would firstly like to clarify that kaakha kaakha is a part of a tamil prayer and roughly translated it means to protect khakhee on the other hand refers to the color of the police uniform which is khakhi br br also the tamil film industry is rather full of purely commercial ventures any rajnikanth or vijay movie would stand testament to that statement br br now kaakha kaakha is an excellent movie with a great soundtrack certainly very stunning in the final scene especially love the ending which is certainly unexpected the gore is rather too much at times but certainly this is a great movie
greenaway seems to have a habit of trying deliberately to disgust his viewers this film opens with incest and purposeless meaningless casual incest at that that's greenaway's big problem he prefers parlor tricks to shock over actually doing anything meaningful technical skill isn't enough he's just a bit perverse for the sake of perversity
after losing the emmy for her performance as mama rose in the television version of gypsy bette won an emmy the following year for bette midler diva las vegas a live concert special filmed for hbo from las vegas midler who has been performing live on stage since the 1970's proves that she is still one of the most electrifying live performers in the business from her opening number her classic friends where she descends from the wings atop a beautiful prop cloud bette commands the stage with style and charisma from a rap styled number called i look good she then proves that she has a way with a joke like few other performers in this business as she segues her way through a variety of musical selections the section of the show where she salutes burlesque goes on a little too long but she does manage to incorporate her old sophie tucker jokes here to good advantage even though she actually forgets one joke in the middle of telling it but her ad libbing until she remembers it is hysterical bette also treats us to rose's turn from gypsy and the title tune from her smash film the rose as well as a shameless plug for her hit movie the first wives club she brings the house down near the end with stay with me baby from the rose and her only 1 hit record wind beneath my wings from beaches it's a dazzling evening of musical comedy entertainment and for midler fans it's a must
nay sayers of this film are likely bitter from some seriously unrequited love this is a great film for anyone capable of understanding johnny mathis's song or any song from that era bobby darin's beyond the sea or stan getz's the girl from ipanema et al br br i measure films by how many times i have to watch them before i'm satisfied chances are had me back a few good times br br i also watch the synergy between the cast i thought they worked well together br br open your heart and let the comedic magic of film transport you br br 'alan
i jumped at the chance to view this movie uncut and uninterrupted remembering rahs and raves for it but wherever it seemed about to slip into being truly scary it backed off and went somewhere else the dripping water throughout the house the black rain the prophetic dreams taking the wrong turn in raw sewage were dropped before they could work up to a scream br br what a disappointment chamberlain's nearly expressionless mask of a face offered little but confused disbelief something i found myself mirroring as the film wore on what could have been eerie aboriginal chanting and instruments in the background were instead a cacophony seemingly designed to beat terror into one's head the ideas that modern people can embody ancient gods that the aboriginal peoples believe red haired white men were the first priests and many other possibilities are passed along more like a shopping list than a hint at another dimension the dream time br br spoiler in the final scene it wasn't clear to me what the director was trying to tell is there a big wave so what how big a tsunami yeah okay that's devastating but not apocalyptic is it the end of the world from a wave the last wave that'd have to be a pretty darn big wave why was the world that bad a place it didn't seem so awful in this movie actually i didn't think the wave came off since the shadow left burton's face that had been cast by the wave was it only burton's apocalypse heck that happens every day to people who lose it it wasn't of any interest if it was only him br br the most frightening scene and the one that gives the best indication of weir's potential was in charlie's apartment where burton has gone to confront the old man for scaring burton's wife charlie keeps asking him who are you and it becomes truly disturbing after a while unfortunately the movie never followed suit
i absolutely hate it when a film completely falls apart near the end after you've already invested an hour into it and that's what happened with this film i was intrigued by its actors and the fact that malamud wrote its source story i haven't gone to read that story but i cannot imagine that it ends like this film ends fortunately i didn't pay good money to see or rent it because my library had it ohhhh such a waste of excellent acting the wife in particular was so perfect but milo o'shea as a jew now that was funny i haven't researched into its making but it played like the director lost his marbles or died 3 4 of the way through the film before that point a story and characters were developing there were a number of neat plot points and there wasn't too much time wasted but ooh that last 1 2 hour if that wasn't the screwiest most worthless denouement i've ever witnessed i don't know what is i just hate it when one's faith is so destroyed like that it feels like an act of violence
i always enjoy this movie when it shows up on tv br br the one scene that always stands out for me that is is the one with the myrna loy and the painters foreman where she gives him very explicit instructions on the colours and as soon as she goes away he turns the his guys and says did you get that that's yellow blue green and white
in the citadel film series book the films of gene kelly anchors aweigh is described as a kingpin of a musical i sure can't do better than that it's such an important film in both the careers of gene kelly and frank sinatra kathryn grayson didn't do too badly with this either br br louis b mayer had lent gene kelly out to columbia where harry cohn had an inspiration to let kelly choreograph his own numbers and because of it cover girl became a classic so if mayer didn't learn a lesson producer joe pasternak did and allowed kelly artistic control when anchors aweigh was finished fred astaire at last had a dancing rival for monarch of cinema dance br br the main number everyone talks about with gene kelly here is the dance with jerry mouse originally kelly wanted to do the number with walt disney's mickey mouse but disney wasn't lending mickey out to nobody mickey would have to wait until who framed roger rabbit to do an outside film not to worry because mgm had it's own animated rodent one half the team of tom and jerry br br kelly as dancer always strived to do something new and different on screen as did fred astaire for the next dozen years these two were allowed all kinds of artistic control and were praised for their work even if the films themselves weren't up to snuff it was like each inspired the other to bigger and better creativity kelly for mgm astaire for mgm and any number of other studios in anchors aweigh kelly got sinatra to dance a bit in fact frank sinatra always gave credit to gene kelly for showing him how musicals should be done as he gave credit to both burt lancaster and montgomery clift for their help in earning him is oscar for from here to eternity br br when frank sinatra had half of his contract bought from rko by mgm he insisted on a little artistic creativity on his own he'd become friends with the songwriting team of jule styne and sammy cahn in his autobiography sammy cahn tells about how sinatra insisted that they write his songs for this film louis b mayer gave in and the team wrote some really fine ballads for him to sing one of my favorite sinatra numbers comes from anchors aweigh i fall in love too easily frank sings it accompanying himself on the piano at an empty hollywood bowl it's sinatra at his best br br with jule styne and later with jimmy van heusen sammy cahn richly earned the title of having put more song lyrics in frank sinatra's mouth than any other person they were lifetime friends and cahn always credited sinatra with this milestone boost in his career br br on a bet styne and cahn said they could write a song just using a chromatic scale they proved it in anchors aweigh when kathryn grayson put her soprano to work on all of a sudden my heart sings she also did some classical numbers br br here singing in fact is the basis of the plot two sailors on leave through a combination of circumstances meet up with kathryn grayson and her orphaned nephew dean stockwell trying to fix her up with sinatra kelly says he can get her an audition with jose iturbi they spend the film trying to accomplish just that br br my only disappointment in anchors aweigh was that pamela britton who plays the waitress 'brooklyn' never got a number herself she had gotten rave reviews from her performance as meg brockie in brigadoon on broadway and that's what brought her to hollywood i have a suspicion she had a number that was cut and somewhere in mgm's vaults it might still be br br anchors aweigh is a great example of why musicals just aren't made any more all that creative talent was under contract to metro goldwyn mayer if you had to pay market value for it the cost might retire some third world country's debt br br but the film results would be extraordinary
i don't understand why the other comments focus on mcconaughey he has never been a very interesting film actor br br the best part of this movie is the writing and the wit alfred molina and patrick mcgaw make an unusual comic duo definitely not stock types although one can't say their characters are well developed that doesn't make them any less funny br br the version i saw was on hdnet and had subtitles for the spanish dialog so that was certainly not a problem the use of spanish gives it more authenticity br br a very underrated movie judging by the unusually low score imdb members have given it i thought it was fun and interesting and worth a 7 at least a lot of slick movies with higher scores and making big money at the box office are much less interesting
let me start off by saying that i didn't watch this movie at first with high expectations it was recommended to me by a friend with mediocre taste in movies and mtv was pasted on the front cover so i was not expecting much what i was expecting was a tear jerker overly dramatic but at least effective br br i was wrong br br firstly let me start off that i had never read the book nor watched any other versions of the movie br br the acting was my main gripe with the film by god is it awful the main girl is pretty mediocre but when compared to the rest of the cast she's maryl streep the main hero heath is just plain awful he can sing decent sounding clichéd songs but that's about it his acting broke the 'sad' moments by being so bad at points that i just burst into laughter the isabel girl was pretty godawful too and the brother was just a flat character that was played by an actor that couldn't display emotion whatsoever and when he tried to it failed miserably neil patrick harris was the only decent actor playing edward although it's obvious the direction was bad because even he did not live up to what i've seen him do oh and the father wasn't half bad to my memory but he was in the movie for such a small amount of time i can hardly remember br br the story itself was not very good more breakups than you can imagine predictable story until the ending which i barely understood extremely one sided characters with no real depth to them overall just not interesting or compelling nothing we've never seen before done much better and nothing worth watching here br br the ending is suppose to be a tearjerker it did nothing of the sort the ending isn't built up at all it almost feels like an afterthought in fact i had to ask my friends why the ending actually happened which when they explained it to me i must have had a look on my face of wait when did they say that what never a good sign the editing was probably the worst i've seen though i do understand the fade ins fade outs are done because this was originally made for tv but that's really no excuse br br overall the movie is just garbage i'm a sensitive guy i cried during two episodes of the simpsons i never cried during this crap not even close really this movie is not worth your time if you really want to see a tearjerker look elsewhere
the closing song by johnny rivers was the only great thing about this movie unfortunately that is all the positive i can say about this western movie i have to write 8 more lines for my comments to be posted but there is more than 8 lines of awful in this western i am not sure if the movie was a tribute to hopa along or just a spoof the hero and the villain in this movie were too plastic not realistic at all a lot of the supporting actors in this movie looked authentic but the shooting scenes were a joke a previous commentator thought this movie was great and in the comments took a cheap shot at president bush this was not a democratic or republican western it was just a bad western movie to be sold commercially i wonder if it made any money at times i thought i was watching a movie made by college movie students if that was the case then it was a great movie
jodie foster cherie currie the former lead singer of the seminal all girl rock group the runaways in her remarkably able acting debut marilyn kagan and kandice stroh are uniformly believable splendid and touching as the titular quartet who are a tight knit clique of troubled fiercely loyal adolescent girls with negligent uncaring self absorbed parents who do their best to grow up and fend for themselves in the affluent san fernando valley california suburbs the girls are forced to make serious decisions about sex drugs alcohol commitment and so on at a tender young age when they're not fully prepared to completely own up to the potentially harmful consequences of said decisions foster giving one of her most perceptive affecting and underrated performances to date is basically the group's den mother who presides over the well being of both herself and the others she's especially concerned about the good hearted but reckless and self destructive currie whose carelessly hedonistic lifestyle makes her likely to meet an untimely end br br this picture offers a poignant insightful often devastatingly credible and thoroughly absorbing examination of broken dysfunctional families which exist directly underneath suburbia's neatly manicured surface and the tragic net result of such families tough resilient but unhappy and vulnerable kids who have to confront the trials and tribulations of growing up on their own because their parents are either too inconsiderate or even nonexistent adrian fatal attraction jacob's ladder lyne's direction is both sturdy and observant while gerald ayres' script is somewhat messy and rambling but overall still accurate in its frank gritty unsentimental depiction of your average latchkey kid's nerve wrackingly chaotic capricious and unpredictable everyday life leon bijou's soft dewy almost pastoral cinematography properly suggests a delicate and easily breakable sense of tranquility and innocence giorgio moroder arranged the excellent score which makes particularly effective use of donna summer's elegiac on the radio the top notch cast includes sally kellerman as foster's neurotic insecure peevish mother scott baio as a sweet skateboarder dude randy quaid as kagan's rich older boyfriend british 60's pop singer adam faith as foster's feckless absentee rock promoter father and lois smith as kagan's smothering overprotective mother appearing in brief bits are robert romanus mike damone fast times at richmont high as one of foster's morose ex boyfriends and a gawky braces wearing laura dern as an obnoxious party crasher achingly authentic engrossing and deeply moving currie's grim ultimate fate is very heart breaking foxes is quite simply one of the most unsung and under appreciated teen movies made about early 80's adolescence
if i could have rated this movie by 0 i would have i see some ppl at imdb says that this is the funniest movie of the year etc etc excuse me are you ppl snorting lsd or there is absolutely nothing funny about this movie n o t h i n g i actually want my 27 minutes back of my life that i spent watching this piece of crap br br i read someone sitting on an airplane watching this movie stopped watching after 30 minutes i totally understand that i actually would have watched snakes on a plane for 2 times over instead of watching this movie once br br do not watch this movie do something else useful with your life do the dishes walk the dog hell anything is better than spending time in front of the tv watching hot rod
this is a great example of a rather simple film noir story that is handled exceptionally well thanks to excellent direction by otto preminger as well as some lovely acting performances dana andrews stars as a hot headed detective who all too often uses his fists instead of his brains soon after the film begins andrews is being reprimanded for this and is warned that if this continues he'll be off the force a bit later while investigating a crime he's attacked by a suspect and andrews is forced to fight to protect himself this time he does not use excessive force but the assailant is killed andrews panics and assumes they won't believe him so he tries to cover up the death though instead an innocent man is ultimately blamed for the crime br br there's a lot more to the film than this including a plot involving a slimy villain gary merrill and a love interest for andrews gene tierney all in all this is one of the better examples of the genre with great gritty dialog superb lighting and a simple yet very effective story this is the way noir was meant to be
absolutely wonderful drama and ros is top notch i highly recommend this movie her performance in my opinion was academy award material the only real sad fact here is that universal hasn't seen to it that this movie was ever available on any video format whether it be tape or dvd they are ignoring a very good movie but universal has little regard for its library on dvd which is sad if you get the chance to see this somewhere not sure why it is rarely even run on cable see it i won't go into the story because i think most people would rather have an opinion on the film and too many reviewers spend hours writing about the story which is available anywhere br br a 10
no need to detail what others have written in other reviews here goes the summary br br much of the nested animation work is downright gorgeous the colors are superb would love to have it done in silk as a necktie br br the story and execution is a total snooze it was quite difficult to stay awake at times br br if you are a student of the fine arts medieval calligraphy early religion and so forth have at it this is a film for you br br if you want an engaging entertaining movie look elsewhere this is a failure as anything other than an artistic statement br br vikings didn't have horns by the way
dreadful acting a thinly veiled attempt to slam those on the left side of the aisle br br women are subjugated and revolve around men tom selleck shows his acting range from a to b
warning there might be spoilers ahead if you care br br okay the basic premise of this homegrown texas film is college kids spookhouse evil magic book scary stuff in practice it equals a lot of time looking at the time to see how much longer this movie is going to drag on a bunch of frat boys along with assorted girlfriends volunteers is setting up a charity haunted house the project is being presided over by a thoroughly repellent character whose main purpose seems to be verbally physically assaulting as many cast members as possible i had a hard time believing that anyone would even attempt to work with this person in any capacity he's nothing but rude and abusive to everyone including his girlfriend and his buddy regardless the kids are visited by local character annual pumpkin carving champion pumpkin jack an elderly coot who is described as the santa claus of halloween and who drops off a load of props for the house including an ominous book that figured prominently in the irritatingly strobe flashed prologue where a gaggle of robed cultists get turned into stir fry needless to say some damn fool starts messing with the book and eventually most of the costumed monsters turn into real ones and the remaining few normal folk have to try and survive there's some good stuff in this film but not much everything is shot well and the makeup effects are decent on the other hand the performers either underact or overact drastically much of the plot makes little sense outside of a this happens so that can happen series there is hardly any musical score to speak of just snatches of songs throughout the film and the movie takes an hour to actually get anywhere that last problem is the most telling two thirds of the 90 minute running time is used to repeatedly set up the characters tom is a nice guy dating heidi the control freak but he used to date jill who is now dating dan the jerk but she's started a relationship kira the girl who wears too many shawls capes dan is a really big jerk gary likes to play jokes and steve lily like to have a lot of sex stuff that could have easily been dealt with in 20 minutes or so drags on and on to the point where the lesbian sex scene calm down it's pretty tame left me looking for the fast forward button that leaves us with half an hour of lo calorie scares a klunky ending and a deep seated dislike of ol' pumpkin jack who i blame for the whole mess unless you can get this on some sort of deep discount rental and really have seen everything else in the store put it back on the shelf and keep looking
i'm grateful to cesar montano and his crew in reviving the once moribund visayan film understorey panaghoy is hopefully the forerunner of a resurgence in this vernacular that claims more speakers than tagalog the dialect and lifestyle details are accurately reminiscent of this region of the philippines downside the corny and stilted acting of the american antagonist the other item that i didn't appreciate was the lack of authenticity in the period costume of the same character and above all his bright red kit car that i suppose was meant to pass for a 1930s roadster without those small yet glaring details panaghoy would've been at least a 9 out of 10 on my rating daghang salamat manoy cesar addendum this film sure beats peque gallaga's oro plata mata which provided a different view of the visayas during the second world war alos there are some parts where the cinematography harks back to spielberg's the color purple and the storyline begins to become reminiscent of noli me tangere
sergio martino's the case of the scorpion's tail is a scenic giallo from the early 70's heyday of the genre an explosion on an aeroplane results in one million dollars in insurance money for a bereaved but unfaithful wife the money is subsequently snatched by a black clad assassin and a series of brutal murders follow br br scorpion's tail plays the mystery element written by giallo specialist ernesto gastaldi fairly straight but being a giallo the murders themselves are memorable and well staged in fact the violence in this movie is very strong in places a scene with a broken bottle being particularly graphic the emphasis on the violence no doubt influencing the giallo genre to move into more and more extreme territory but like the best films in the genre the brutality is offset by a good score and attractive photography the music by bruno nicolai is at times reminiscent of ennio morricone's avant garde work in the bird with the crystal plumage but is also strong in its own right the photography is helped by the nice use of foreign locales in this case london and athens where martino manages to get in respectively the houses of parliament and the acropolis there is also some inventive camera work too the most effective being the use of slow motion in a sequence where a woman runs towards the door where the maniac is prowling outside in this particular scene martino has the killer hack through the door with a knife in a manner influenced by dario argento's crystal plumage however it also has the killer attempt to flick the latch open with the blade of a knife which is something repeated later by argento in suspiria so martino's film is influential in its own right br br this is a good solid giallo that both genre and non genre fans can appreciate the performances are good and the production values are fine although the plane explosion is shall we say somewhat low budget the dvd release by noshame is nice it has both the english and italian language options which is a real bonus however it is worth pointing out that at times you need to be a fast reader to fully appreciate the english subtitle option this applies to both the movie and the documentary in the extras this is a minor point though the dvd release is a worthy addition to any giallo collection
unfortunately in cases such as these there are so many conflicting stories as everyone tries to cast blame on to others that it is a near impossibility to get a clear picture of what really happened this movie is a victim of such circumstances the writers too many of them have decided to take all of the stories and give them to the audience to let them decide which version of the truth they like the best as in the real life case there is no clear answer no conclusion and the audience is left with a general felling of being unfulfilled like coffee without the caffeine or sex without the climax whodunnits with no whodunnit are generally frustrating and makes you wonder why someone didn't do research before they put it out there at least tout your movie as a fiction if that is what it amounts to and this does br br that is not to say there are not some great performances here kilmer as holmes does an outstanding role bringing some humanity to what is otherwise an unsavory character kilmer and the real life lovers and friends who consulted on the film let the audience see a selfish troubled human being who though his faults were many and large was loved and cared for by many people except himself kudrow as holmes's wife only gives a glimmer of the dramatic actress she can be but it is very noticeable and unforgettable glimmer bosworth's character was not as emotionally complex as she could have been and needed to show more inner conflict to give credence to what ultimately happened between dawn and holmes she turned him in 6 months after they fled to florida bosworth's apple cheeked performance is at time annoying at times touching but shows none of the backbone the real schiller must have possessed the other characters fade in to the woodwork which is a pity lucas is a great performer who could have sunk his teeth in to this role had it been fleshed out for him even dylan mcdermott was surprisingly capable in his role of drug dealing biker br br the fault of this movie does not lie with this cast but with the writing too many cooks spoil the soup and this kettle filled with so much promise ultimately leaves you hungry the story and characters may have been less than sympathetic but in what movie of this ilk are they not so other movies such as 1989's drugstore cowboy starring matt dillon who was reportedly asked to take this role and refused worked with similar subject matter and mastered it to such a degree that you felt a kinship with the main character by the end of the movie despite what he had done van sandt could have given james cox and his crew a few lessons had someone bothered to try and find the truth this would have been an intriguing story as it is you will find the accompanying wadd documentary more palatable in the 2 disc dvd and much more informative you will realize from the dvd that holmes was not a bad guy but not a very good one either as are most people
i have not read the novel or anything other by kurt vonnegut but i am now intending to start this grips you from the very first frame and does not let go until the end credits start rolling taking you places you don't expect the plot is interesting throughout the pacing is spot on nothing lasts too long and this does a perfect job of balancing between unexpected twists and allowing the viewer to process what we've seen it is well told and well thought out i've never watched a film that i feel i could particularly compare this to it is intense and exciting as well as funny and sad the acting is excellent nolte absolutely shines goodman again proves that he doesn't have to go for laughs and lee and arkin are spellbinding i could go on really no role is treated to a less than stellar performance the editing and cinematography are marvelous and all of the visuals are great with a couple of unforgettable and astonishing ones i am going to go for other movies directed by keith gordon as well as the other two apparently related to this through the author of the books there is one scene of sexuality and a lot disturbing and unsettling content in this i recommend this to anyone who can appreciate it it is not pleasant 8 10
a sexually obsessed chef leads a duplicitous life one as a happily married man with a ten year oldish child the other as a sex fiend the bulk of the documentary like film follows him for five consecutive days and is told in flashback with nastassja kinski as a clinical sex therapist listening to his story and intelligently probing him nastassja's role is very restrictive and she is the only principal adult character who does not take off her clothes if she had i would have rated this movie a big fat f as it is it rates an f implying that it is still a failure unless one likes to be bored it is probably a lot more interesting to spend ninety minutes cleaning out the garage diary of a sex addict falls into the category of films that once one has seen it one wishes that one hadn't
what a shame that alan clarke has to be associated with this tripe that doesn't rule it out however get a group of lads and some stellas together and have a whale of a time running this one again and again and rolling around on the floor in tears of laughter great wasted night stuff al hunter homes in on a well publicised theme of the late 80s that hooligans were well organised and not really interested in the football itself often with respectable jobs estate agent but how clarke can convince us that any of the two bit actors straying from other tv productions of low quality grange hill or soon to go on to poor quality drama eastenders can for a nanosecond make us believe that they are tough football thugs is laughable are we really to believe that the icf on whom of course the drama is based would ever go to another town to fight with just six blokes br br the icf would crowd out tube stations and the like with hundreds andy nicholls' scally needs to be read before even contemplating a story of this nature the acting is appalling and provides most of the laughs oldman is so camp it is unbelievable most of them look as though they should be in a bubble of bath of mr matey a true inspiration to anyone with a digital video camera who thinks they can make a flick go for it
i've seen some very terrible horror movies in my time and while this isn't the worst of the bunch it's certainly in the lower half the script starts off ok a young doctor goes to a hospital as an intern hoping it will vault him to a better job for him and his future wife cute huh the movie then heads straight into the toilet when you realize that something is killing patients turns out that there's a demon on the basement that's harvesting people's souls it's the job of the 1 doctor 1 nurse and 1 security guard in the entire hospital staff to drag this mental patient downstairs do a ritual that pretty much just involves cutting the tongue out and then allowing the haunted house prop of a demon to come out and steal his soul through the magic of cheesy special effects at this point the movie gets so ridiculously stupid i was begging for it to be over there was still an hour to go it looked like a half an hour tales from the crypt episode that somehow got stretched into an hour and a half crap fest from tiny lister doing his best john coffey the green mile impersonation to tracy scoggins playing the stereotypical frigid nurse ratchet this movie fails in every possible level i gave this 2 stars for only two reason 1 his fiancé is pretty hot she eased the pain a little towards the end and 2 the movie actually looks ok a lot better than the current trend of horror movies being made with wal mart quality home cameras br br in the end avoid this turd even if you have the blockbuster movie pass which i do and i still felt cheated as a bonus drinking game you and your buddies take a shot every time matt stasi dr james bishop shakes his head while talking you'll be drunk 15 minutes into the movie
you know you're in trouble when the film your watching has numerous alternate titles generally it means that they tried and retried to hide the turkey in various markets such a turkey is the brain machine which has seven different titles br br its about some super secret government project that is suppose to be able to use a computer to read people but instead it drives people to kill each other or themselves or something like that its filled with b level tv actors sitting in paneled room with lawn chairs trying to act a script that makes almost no sense br br its a turkey of the untastey kind avoid it
review may contain some spoilers i'll make this review short and sweet i bought this movie from best buy because it sounded interested and had some top actors in it like kevin spacey and morgan freeman how bad could it be right well it's pretty bad justin timberlake plays pollack a wannabe journalist who stumbles across a case that may lead to corrupt cops at edison's police force ll cool j is deed a cop within the force on a special force team called f r a t first response assault tactics he's teamed with an on the edge bad cop named lazerov dylan mcdermott in the opening scene we see lazerov deed taking on some bank robbers but at night they are busting a couple of guys doing drugs i don't want to give to much away but things turn bad for the guys doing the drugs pollack who works for ashford morgan freeman goes to a trial involving deeds lazerov he suspect foul play and with the help of ashford does some investigate that turns ugly wallace kevin spacey who is all within the f r a t team joins with ashford to try to bring the corrupt cops to justice br br you can tell from the beginning that freeman and spacey's performance are pretty lackluster the only person that give a all out performance is dylan mcdermott he is a complete nut case in this movie and made a believer out of me ll cool j is terrible in this film he says every line the same way and shows pretty much the same emotion he was much better in movies like deep blue sea any given sunday the film starts off with some nice action but then drags it feet through the rest of the film the ending is far from satisfying br br don't waste your time with this film i'm putting it on ebay this weekend
i thought that the nadir of horror film making had been reached with book of shadows i was wrong this film makes that look like the magnficiant ambersons compared to this piece of shameless unexpurgated fecal matter that has the audacity to call itself a movie i'd write more but i'm still to angry that i was idiot enough to spend £3 renting it bobbins br br and were these people english and where is the forest i have lived in the uk two thirds of my life and as far as i know there are no dark uncharted woodlands in the midlands the whole bally thing looked like a national trust conifer plantation those angels looked like anorexic pornstars turned most of them were did my research i did however like the bit when judd got ripped in pieces br br p s i love and admire tom savini but he cannot act
just as the new bsg wasn't what fans of the original series were expecting caprica may not deliver what fans of the new bsg were expecting for the most part it is a very interesting if not somewhat self involved show or at least the pilot is br br if you're looking for the big cgi thrills of the new bsg you'll be sorely disappointed if you liked the drama you'll probably find something you like and maybe even identify with br br the storyline does examine on how the cylons were developed why adama hates them and the origins of a monotheistic society the writers also manage to tackle humans 'playing god s ' and the creation or re creation of 'human' life it will be interesting to see how this plays out br br i found it to plod along in some parts and too preachy in others but all in all it was promising a small part of me wishes or hopes there might be some minor inklings of bsg in there aside from the back story i mentioned but that would probably convolute the storyline too much like bsg i'll have to wait and see if caprica grows on me but it's way too early to tell br br it would really easy to chalk this up as a failure if you compare it to the previous series but i'm willing to give it a chance overall i thought it was interesting enough to make me see how the actual series is before 'throwing in the proverbial towel'
2 stars out of a possible 10 and that is being overly generous br br i thought with a cast of james woods cathy bates randy quaid lou gossett jr and henry thomas how could it miss i was wrong br br i can only wonder what drugs sam shepard was on the week end he cranked out this piece of dribble i'd long suspected sam s of being kind of nuts this film based on his play confirms it br br this is the kind of artsy b s that actors love to sink their teeth into as it gives them a chance to endlessly emote however for the viewer who sits through this nonsensical trash there is absolutely nothing to love about this movie br br you haven't seen dysfunctional families until you've seen this bunch pa is crazy ma is crazy the son is crazy and the daughter is oh yeah crazy they also have mouths on them that utter words that would make a sailor blush especially the teenage daughter br br in addition to the above as if that weren't enough the plot and it's so thin you could read thorough it has a hole in it the size of alaska br br ma is conspiring to sell their rundown farm as it turns out so is pa now i don't claim to be a real estate expert but the last time i checked property jointly owned must have both of the owners signatures in order to be sold if only one of them owned the property then the other could not legally sell it so it would be pointless for that person to do so mr shepherd prefers to ignore this basic fact and therefore his plot does not work br br not that anything else was really working anyway br br the only possible reason anyone could have for watching this film is if they are absolutely desperate to see james woods in full frontal nudity and i can't imagine why anyone would want to
i saw the latter half of this movie about a year ago and was very happy to finally find it available on dvd recently i watched several of the reality series on pbs about ranching etc none of them came as close to telling the story as this movie does based on real reality pulling no punches bleak happy tragic and enlightening this is a movie that should be shown to students or to anyone interested in early frontier life fine acting on the part of both rip torn and conchata ferrell add to an well done script the opening credit states that it was done though funds supplied through the national endowment for the humanities if this is the kind of product taxes could go to i would be happy to see more i highly recommend it and would encourage people to tell a friend if you have seen it and enjoyed the film
this movie is one of my favourites it is a genre mixture with ingredients of the action horror romantic comedygenre some of the special effects may seem outdated compared to modern standards this minor flaw is easily ignored there is so much to discover in this story the romantic relation between the two main characters is so beautiful that it hurts the visuals are beautiful too the action is great which is no surprise it is originating from honkong birthplace of the world's best action movies the humour sometimes seems a little bit silly but in a good way somehow this movie is being able to balance the different moods and keeps being good absolutely recommended
this film can't make up its mind whether its message is humans are evil and bad and animals are sweet and blameless or don't ever go in the water again a fisherman nolan is out to nab a killer whale a very bad thing but when he accidentally accidentally mark you hits a pregnant cow instead of her mate the cow and i use the word in all senses who is obviously a sick psycho bitch and the canonical villain of the piece throws herself against the propellers trying to chew herself to bits in the most distressing and hideous not to mention ineffectual method of killing herself i doubt it was her first when her unborn fetus aborts from her hideous self inflicted wounds her mate goes mental with revenge and swears to hurt kill and mutilate every human who even so much as talks to nolan obviously as among humans total psychos date other total psychos br br the film reeks of half thought out anti human message the poor poor whale the evil men must suffer and die and yet it does not succeed in demonizing nolan at all it's true that when he set out his motives were selfish and cruel but at the first squeal of the first whale he grows a heart and as the film progresses he grows more and more compassionate to the whale's pain until it seems he will walk out on the ice and give himself to the whale just to make it feel a little better br br the films final journey in which nolan follows the whale on a bizarre journey to the north reminds me of melville's eerie man whale connection and for a moment hinted at a truly interesting conclusion where these two husbands might connect understand even respect each other in their own grief for nolan lost his wife and unborn child also to an accident it's clear nolan respects the whale and feels for its loss however it never goes there the whale character has no compassion or respect for anyone br br the final scene loses this focus and becomes jaws like where the sea monster finally kills everybody and nolan and no doubt through an oversight fails to chomp up the whale hugger tho he made a good snap for her head a little earlier i love animals and i detest whaling and what is more i love orca whales but if this film's goal was to make me feel that the whale was the victim and that people are evil and detestable it completely failed nolan shows compassion and growth and feels for others and all the whale thinks about is killing and maiming br br the only message one can walk away with is if you see an orca whale ever anywhere run the other way cause if you step on his fin the wrong way he will hunt you to the ends of the earth destroying everything around you
this cute animated short features two comic icons betty boop and henry br br henry is the bald slightly portly boy from the comics who never speaks br br well here he does speak br br he wants to get a puppy from betty boop's pet store and when he is left to mind the store some hilarious hijinks ensue br br betty sings a song about pets henry gets in a battle with birds and a monkey but everything works out in the end
i don't think i've ever felt this let down by a film before after loving guy ritchie's two previous films i don't count swept away he was pussy blind i was so looking forward to seeing this br br the reviews were poor then again i don't trust the press anyway more worrying was the fact that the internet buzz was that this was a bit of a stinker so it was with some trepidation i handed over my £4 80 yesterday afternoon br br i'm not even going to try to explain this film mainly because i haven't got a clue what was going on and at one point i was honestly close to standing up and asking if it was just me who didn't get it br br unfortunately i think ritchie seems to have fallen into his wife's trap of taking himself far too seriously it seems it wasn't good enough for him to make films with good plots laughs snappy dialogue and good characters it's almost as if he had a checklist of films he wanted to rip off here are some of the ones i noticed br br the matrix fight club kill bill the usual suspects vanilla sky br br i think the most frustrating thing is that the performances from the two main actors jason statham and ray liotta were actually very good and it was really the self indulgent story and editing direction that let the film down br br so a big big thumbs down from me
for domestic audiences i can see how they would applaud this movie for outsiders with no vested interests it did not make much sense the germans were portrayed as incompetents and the russians as heroes the supposedly romantic angle was superfluous and a distraction how a young woman could 'love' the lieutenant from just glimpsing him was nonsense how she could as mentioned at the end of the movie never marry just because of this infatuation was beyond me i mentioned the germans were portrayed as idiots and that was exemplified in the chase into the marsh several hundred german troops advanced pushing the russians into the marsh so the russians hid and the germans stopped at the edge of the marsh and just stood there listening i suppose they did not want to get their boots wet but i am sure an officer would have ordered 20 or 30 men into the water to search the marsh but that would have ended the story also the germans entered the barn where the russians were hiding in the loft and did not bother to fire into the roof at the worst some soldier would have tossed a grenade into the loft and not climbed a ladder to peer in br br i did see some reviewers who said they cried at the end i wonder why you knew this small band would perish and they was nothing heart tugging in that
this is definitely one of the weirder 70's movies out there and it's most notable for kicking off a decade of bigfoot hysteria it is also notable for the little touches of insanity throughout the movie especially when the dark moody first half is replaced by a musical interlude of all things as another user pointed out one of the songs is dedicated to a character travis crabtree who paddles around in a canoe for a while then leaves never to be seen again although it's painfully dated now i's still a fun scary movie to show to kids and anyone who enjoys either bigfoot lore or 70's hillbilly culture is bound to get a kick out of this my favorite part a guy gets so scared that he jumps headfirst through a door and the narrator explains he went unconscious from shock uh i'd say breaking a door with his head is more likely why he went unconscious but whatever br br 4 10 stars or 7 10 if you like bad americana
they probably could have skipped some of the beginning i'm not sure why this starts out in the asian part of turkey if it was because starting in the mediterranean they could have gotten closer starting in modern day lebanon br br one the cameras and crews get to the bakhtyari tribe it's the beginning of an amazing 48 day journey 50 000 people with about 250 000 goats camels cattle and horses make this amazing trek across what seems to be a very fast moving karun river they use rafts that are kept afloat by inflating goat skins you can see where the head and legs were removed the other bank of the river was very steep i'm guessing about a 60 degree rise br br just watching that was incredible but there was much more to come to get to the pastures they also had to cross a major mountain that had about 4 feet of snow if not more being able to climb this mountain was pretty amazing in and of itself but they and all of the animals climbed this mountain barefoot yes barefoot br br the one drawback to this documentary were some of the inter titles with poor attempts at humor br br if you want to see a documentary from the silent era or the incredible challenges that this tribe not only face but conquer this is just an incredible document of a little known group of people facing all kinds of challenges
john wayne albert dekker compete for oil rights on indian territory and for the attention of martha scott in this republic pictures film shot out of utah usa br br an interesting western of sorts due to its characters and its more modern setting with wayne dekker playing the old and new factions of the west it's based on a story by thomson burtis who co writes the script along with eleanore griffin and ethel hill albert rogell directs in the workmanlike way that befits his career a pretty mundane story is in truth saved by its final third where thankfully the action picks up and we are treated to something resembling a pulse the light hearted approach to the romantic strand doesn't sit quite right and a glorious fist fight between the two protagonists is ruined by rogell being unable to disguise the stunt men doing the work but hey stunt men deserve their moment of glory always solid support comes from george 'gabby' hayes and wayne as usual has much screen charisma particularly when rattling off his pistol but in spite of its better than usual republic budget it remains a film of interest only to 1940s wayne enthusiasts 4 10
i admit creating great expectations before watching because some friends mentioned it and they are not pervs as a must see and it is a must see just don't expect to see something outbreaking br br the freudian psychoanalyzes are interesting in many parts of the film but there's just too much perversion and it doesn't stick in the end br br some of the good things are the analyzes of kieslowski's blue most of david lynch's some of hitchcock's and perhaps a couple more i missed i just remembered dogville and i usually don't miss things unless they are too obvious or loose in the air br br other than being repetitive which makes it too long the documentary is enjoyable in the sense of noticing some perversions fed by our unconscious hence the commercial success of most thrillers studied and used as basis for this theory br br i really enjoyed the energetic tone of the narration and the effort of mr zizek to revive freud's theory which has been numb for too long specially in north america again it's way over the top and i believe not to be a completely waste of time for i do believe most humans have a dark appreciation for death and blood
i just picked up the dvd release of this movie while on holiday in norway where it has been released with english subtitles br br the film is beautifully photographed and powerfully acted the youngster portraying 'frits' the lead character has an astonishingly open face which mirrors with painful accuracy the tragic events which unfold around him br br early on in the film we see that the father whom frits loves so much has mental health problems and this is brought up when the brutal headmaster denies assaulting the boy and suggests it was his own father br br the climactic scene where frits refuses to show any respect to the headmaster simply standing his ground and repeating 'liar' as he is brutally assaulted in front of his classmates is a scene you are not likely to forget br br the films only weak point is the rather clichéd 'flower power' teacher who uses every 'friendly teacher' trick in the book other than this i feel sure that this is a film you will really enjoy
the show is average it doesn't make me laugh particularly however i think courtney really brings it down she doesn't look natural she has these three ways to talk all robotic she talks quietly with no intonation she talks normally with no intonation or she does that thing where she starts talking normally and starts yelling gradually however her yelling is like let's pretend i'm yelling because i shouldn't be too loud on the set br br she is constantly aware of herself being this cute actress doing this funny thing it's annoying you can't really get her personality because she doesn't really produce emotion and doesn't get upset she has this husband who's doing all these stupid things and there is no reaction from her very dry and plain acting
until now the worst movie i had ever seen was ben arthur you really should check the reviews for that movie instead of this one the review statistics for this movie have been skewed positive through a relentless and unscrupulous push by some of the people involved in making it evidence for which is fairly easy to uncover online at least the people who made ben arthur were honorable enough to let it stand on its own shaky legs instead of unscrupulously promoting it so suckers like me would buy it br br everything about this movie is terrible the script the story the casting the acting the direction the photography the editing the music what else goes into a movie whatever it is here it's as bad as it gets if it weren't so unpleasant it would be ridiculous i kept watching it thinking it must get better because i hadn't yet discovered that none of the positive reviews for it are reliable br br it does not take a lot of money to make a great movie nor does a low budget mean a movie has to be bad my favorite example of a shoestring budget masterpiece is gus van sant's amazing mala noche but there are many others sideline secretsdirector's cut or originalis bad not because the people who made it had no money but because they had gigantic egos and no talent for anything at all except self promotion
when i found the movie in the schedule for christmas its title did not sound familiar to me since i have not read the novel and had not heard anything about the film yet having read the content i decided to spend my christmas evening on watching the movie the effect surprised me totally i do not remember when i last saw a film in which every single moment involved me a vow to cherish is without any doubt one of the movies that now constitutes a real surprise i have received from cinema here are some arguments of mine why i consider this film a highly underrated piece of good cinema br br first the entire content is particularly educational it has something to offer to the modern audience pure right faith and some answers for the universal questions is there a need for christ in our times does love still matter what for is there faith what is the logics of burden and suffering in life is there really someone by my side i can always trust the movie provides the answers through the content since all that happens to the characters may as well happen to any of us br br second the movie is exceptionally humane the main characters experience inner struggles and cope with extremely hard decisions is it better for kyle david denman and teri megan paul to start their own lives and forget about the family or retain the values they were taught at home is it better for john ken howard to leave ellen barbara babcock his sick wife and start a new happy life with julia donna bullock a woman he falls in love with in fact ellen no longer recognizes him yet he decides to vow his wife eternal fidelity had john's rebellious brother phil d david morin better go on his easy life although it does not bring him satisfaction or once start to think seriously of his life phil's prayer to god in the park is a psychological masterwork of universal aspect of humanity these words could be as well said by everybody no matter of where when or how they live br br third the movie is a great portrayal of family not very popular nowadays there are problems yet there is always something more powerful that gets these people together this something is love and trust i know that it may seem a bit idealistic not all families can rely on fidelity and it may not be as simple as that nevertheless it is a very educational aspect and a realistic one br br fourth the entire film focuses on people's mutual help if we want to live happy lives in our society we must understand one thing we have to help one another alexander ossie davis is an example of such attitude at the beginning of the movie we see him talk to john about praying later he helps his brother alexander is a kinda angel that is sent to john and his family isn't it possible that we may become angels to one another br br fifth the artistic features are also worth attention performances barbara babcock gives an authentic performance as ellen and although she has a difficult role she does a perfect job consider for instance the moment she appears at school and badly wants to teach again ken howard is also memorable as the faithful husband picture the most memorable for me was the scene of john and ellen in the park walking on the fallen leaves autumn while the sunshine love spreads everywhere i interpreted as a sort of symbol even if there is sorrow this can always be illuminated by light and joy br br a vow to cherish is a wonderful movie that realistically showed to me what it means to love what fidelity is as well it once again proved to me how beautiful it is to live and believe at the end i would like to quote the profound words from the movie i found very touching and hope you will also do br br kyle to his uncle phil yes he john brighton lives according to the bible but nobody forces you to do so yet according to what rules do you live
while the overall idea of escape from atlantis was intriguing i found the film to be far less than what i had hoped for upon reading the plot summery perhaps i am too much of a child in the technological age the movie was made as it is now 2002 an official five years ago after viewing fantasy epics such as lord of the rings and science fiction feats like star wars as a whole it could not compare to other movies of similar line such as dinotopia or homer's the odyssey br br my beef basically is that i couldn't relate i am just about the same age of the children a young adult and have no trouble putting myself in the place of a middle aged man if that is the character available but the picture did not take me to a different mental plain of existence i didn't find myself saying 'ack i would have done the same thing ' it did not open the doors to my imagination even without comparing it to high budget films or other tv movies standing alone certain aspects of the feature i found to be cliche the character development in the children occurred too rapidly for my liking seeing too much of the stereotypical selfish teenager bitter after divorce image changing into the we're a big happy family let's never separate again feel that can ultimately make or break a picture in the long run even the characters themselves could have undergone improvement a typical set of one or the other stereotypes there was the ever present selfish beauty looking to be rebellious accompanied by mr perfect image of combining athletics good looks and intelligence yet a brooding attitude and lastly the smart aleck little brother we find to be so common these days while i know the personalities pushed the story along i think that adding more individuality as far as nuances and more unique differences would have made it a more enjoyable and believable as far as character movie br br i do have to raise my glass to the costume and set design that made it worth finishing to the end for me don't get me wrong all movies are worth seeing for yourself and the opinion of one could never account for the opinion of many but i think that with a little more depth to the script and a little more i cannot believe i am saying this realness i dare say escape from atlantis could have been magical
i wasn't a fan of seeing this movie at all but when my gf called me and said she had a free advanced screening pass i tagged along only for the sake of seeing eva longoria and laughing at jason biggs antics br br overall it was actually better then i expected but not by much this was like a hybrid of how to lose a guy in 10 days and just like heaven a typical romantic comedy with its moments i guess the movie was quite short though around 85 min but it was enough to tell the whole story build some character development and have a decent happy ending the whole idea of a ghost haunting its former husband was a interesting plot to follow eva did a good job of keeping up the sarcasm and paul rudd and the rest of the supporting cast especially jason biggs kept the laughs coming at a smooth pace br br overall i liked the movie only because it had a good amount of laughs to keep me going otherwise i would have given this movie a lower rating hey its a chick flick and i'm reviewing this movie from a guy's persepctive alright it would be more of a fair fight if females reviewied this movie and gave there thoughts about it
this movie is phoniness incarnate a straight 11 10 on the phoniness scale the fakeness of the accents as well as the tightness of the cardigan spandex pants are just staggering yanks although the real scotland may be just as colourful if you ever go there don't expect to be given much of a the chance to dance out controversies with the locals also don't attempt to sway local opinion through the otherwise fine art of tapdancing br br there are a couple of infectious singing and dancing scenes but the plot is far too cheesy and linear and the dialogue is often too weak i also doubt whether anyone would want to be stuck in a timewarped 18 th century scottish village in the boondocks rather than gay new york city maybe it wasn't such a big sacrifice for that priest to have left brigadoon maybe he was just trying to get the hell out of that dump br br watch it for the fine alternative reality view of what a christopher streed day parade in scotland would look like on lsd other than that i'd only recommend it to hollywood muscial completists
don't waste time reading my review go out and see this astonishingly good episode which may very well be the best columbo ever written ruth gordon is perfectly cast as the scheming yet charming mystery writer who murders her son in law to avenge his murder of her daughter columbo is his usual rumpled befuddled and far cleverer than he seems self and this particular installment features fantastic chemistry between gordon and falk ironically this was not written by heralded creators levinson or link yet is possibly the densest most thoroughly original and twist laden columbo plot ever utterly satisfying in nearly every department and overflowing with droll and witty dialogue and thinking truly unexpected and inventive climax tops all 10 10 seek this one out on netflix
if you want to see intelligent philosophical discussion of human possibility and potential watch waking life which is brilliant what the do we know is all over the place in its focus poorly directed poorly written poorly acted utterly devoid of any art direction and completely annoying it wasn't thought provoking or entertaining in the slightest the inclusion of that rambling freak ramtha in this film is reason enough to avoid it isn't it strange how the filmmakers choose to look over the fact that this woman worships some 2 000 year old atlantian god or something what a flake that old chick is and what a total waste of my time and money this movie was the people responsible for this film should not be allowed to make another movie ever again
the school nerd marty simon scuddamore is sexually humiliated by a bunch of classmates and then is in a lab explosion set by them also where his face is scarred by acid years later all the jerks get invited back to the high school since closed for a reunion what they didn't know is that marty is inviting them back to kill them then a storm starts they're locked in the school and marty starts to take revenge br br pretty silly the murders are inventive and gory and there are some creepy atmospheric shots of the deserted school but that's about it the humiliations inflicted on scuddamore are more than cruel he's stripped has his head dunked in a toilet and gets burnt and are just uncomfortable to watch considering scuddamore committed suicide shortly after this was released make them almost impossible to view also this movie goes out of its way to have nudity there is full frontal of scuddamore surprising for any movie but one girl decides to take a bath alone after they know a killer is wandering around after them and then there's the couple that has to have sex this is the type of film where the killer seems to know where everybody is going to be and can teleport himself to them it ends with a twist which had me groaning and rolling my eyes then another twist which had me wanting to throw something heavy at the tv the acting is bearable not good but bearable caroline munro is in this too she's a very beautiful woman but not much of an actress br br this gets a 3 for some effectively gory murders and atmosphere otherwise it's run of the mill and forgettable scuddamore's tragic suicide has given this film more attention than it deserves
i'd waited for some years before this movie finally got released in england but was in many ways very pleased when i finally saw it there are a lot of great things to the film for a start the acting its not something i have all that much need for in a horror picture but the people in this film all put in fine work this and the constantly gripping and interesting script with a nice sorta lovecraftian feel to it give the film a real solid backbone add to this the doses of surreal nightmare imagery and occasional gruesome gore and the films a winner it has my favorite kind of gore too supernatural and splattery also the characters of marcus the angry bodybuilding transsexual and daisy his mentally retarded lover plaything are genuinely freakish and unnerving at times and give a far out anything goes sense of morbid grown up craziness which works well with the frequent freudian overtones this is one of the most impressive recent horror movies far more shocking or out there than anything hollywood can produce my only gripe was that i wanted the ending to be darker in tone but it still works so on the whole i'd really recommend this to serious horror buffs
it's not so much that spontaneous combustion had little potential indeed the under explored title phenomenon is quite intriguing and for at least the opening half this tobe hooper effort promises to entertain in a way only cheesy '90s horror can but somewhere between brad dourif's on again off again performance and the overly intricate plot this would be thriller loses its way br br dourif featured here before his built in horror fan base had accumulated is average guy sam of course average guys don't stay average for long in horror movies so after a well done origin outline we see sam's various body parts start to ignite soon he's igniting other people too much to the consternation of gal pal lisa played unmemorably by cynthia bain br br while the title of the film implies a fire happy monster on the loose director hooper opted to make sam an unwilling killer this approach gives the film an added human depth it would otherwise lack but it also prevents us from truly fearing the human flamethrower we're left wondering whether this would have worked better as a straight up villain versus everyone effort ala nightmare on elm street br br spontaneous combustion is a pretty nominal effort when all is said and done it will carry added appeal for dourif's fans and those who can't get enough 1990s horror be it good bad or in between but only on a slow night
the 63 year reign of queen victoria is perhaps one of the most documented and popularly known historical reigns in british history on the one hand her story lacks the theatrics of earlier royals thanks to a change in social climate and attitudes and on the other her story is one that perpetuates because it is notably human taking on the earlier years of her life where the budding romance between herself and the german prince albert was taking forefront director jean marc vallée who has only until recently remained in the unbeknownst shadows of the industry here takes victoria's story and captures that human element so vital to her legacy it's a story that feels extremely humble considering its exuberant background and yet that's partly what gives it a distinct edge here that separates it from the usual fare br br taking a very direct and focused approach that centres in on a brief five or so year period between her ascension and marriage to albert the young victoria does what so little period pieces of this nature offer instead of attempting a sprawling encapsulation of such a figure's entire life vallée instead opts to show one of the lesser known intricacies of victoria's early years which are easily overlooked in favour of the more publicly known accolades the result is a feature that may disgruntle historians thanks to its relatively flippant regards to facts and the like yet never to let document get in the way of extracting a compelling story writer julian fellowes sticks to his guns and delivers a slightly romanticised yet convincing portrayal vallée takes this and runs making sure to fully capitalise on those elements with enough restraint to maintain integrity in regards to both the history involved and the viewer watching br br a major part in the joy of watching the young victoria play out however simply lies in the production values granted here that bring early 1800's regal britain to life with a vigorous realism so rarely achieved quite so strikingly by genre films everything from the costume designs sets hair styles lighting and photography accentuates the grandiose background inherent to victoria's story without ever over encumbering it indeed while watching vallée's interpretation come to life here it is very hard not to be sucked in solely through the aesthetics that permeates the visual element and then there's the film's score also which works tremendously to further the very elegant yet personal tones that dominate fellowes' script entwining the works of schubert and strauss into victoria and albert's story not only works as a point of reference for the characters to play with but also melds to the work with an elegance and refrain that echoes composer ilan eshkeri's original work just as well br br yet for all the poignant compositions lush backdrops and immaculate costumes that punctuate every scene the single most important factor hereand indeed to most period dramasare the performances of the cast and how they help bring the world they exist in to life thankfully the young victoria is blessed with an equally immaculate ensemble of thespians both young and old that do a fantastic job of doing just that between the sweet budding romance of victoria emily blunt and albert rupert friend and the somewhat antagonistic struggles of her advisors and the like spearheaded by a terrific mark strong and paul bettany the conflicts and warmth so prevalent to fellowe's screenplay are conveyed perfectly here by all involved which helps keep the movie from being a plastic nice to look at but dim underneath affair so common with these outings br br in the end it's hard to fault a work such as the young victoria it's got a perfectly touching and human sense of affection within its perfectly paced romance plus some historical significance that plays as an intriguing source of interest for those in the audience keen on such details of course it may not take the cinematic world by storm and there lacks a certain significance to its overall presence that stops it from ever becoming more than just a poignantly restrained romantic period drama yet in a sense this is what makes it enjoyable vallée never seems to be striving for grandeur nor does he seem content at making a run of the mill escapist piece for aficionados somewhere within this gray middle ground lies the young victoria sure to cater to genre fans and those a little more disillusioned by the usual productions beautiful memorable but most of all human br br a review by jamie robert ward http www invocus net
this i think is one of the best pictures ever made it's so pure and beautiful it really touched me i'm glad david lynch proved that a film doesn't necessarily need sfx a twisting complicated plot or flashy images way to go dave i'd like to see cronenberg do that
during a kurt weill celebration in brooklyn where do we go from here was finally unearthed for a screening it is amazing that a motion picture from any era that has weill gershwin collaborations can possibly be missing from the screens the score stands tall and a cd of the material with gershwin and weill only underscores its merits which are considerable yes the film has its problems but the score is not one of them ratoff is not in his element as the director of this musical fantasy and fred macmurray cannot quite grasp the material then too the 'modern' segment is weakly written but the fantasy elements carry the film to a high mark as does the work of the two delightful leading ladies joan leslie and june haver both have the charm that this kind of work desperately needs to work as a world war ii salute to our country's history albeit in a 'never was' framework the film has its place in hollywood musical history and should be available for all to see and to find its considerable merits
this movie was exactly what i expected not great but also not that bad either in my opinion pg13 movies aren't scary enough so that's why i already knew i was going to be bored throughout the entire film sure there were scary things going on in the hotel room but nothing we all haven't already seen i guess i didn't like it because i thought there were too many twists and turns happening it got old and repetitive i also didn't understand if all the things cusack was experiencing in the room was real or not there is no explanation for any of the events that occurred the movie just drags on and when it finally does come to an end you want it to keep going because you are still waiting around for someone to tell you what the whole movie was about what i did like was the special effects other than that there wasn't much enjoyment from it maybe its just me but i thought this was below average
well what can i say br br what the bleep do we know has achieved the nearly impossible leaving behind such masterpieces of the genre as the postman the dungeon master merlin and so fourth it will go down in history as the single worst movie i have ever seen in its entirety and that ladies and gentlemen is impressive indeed for i have seen many a bad movie br br this masterpiece of modern cinema consists of two interwoven parts alternating between a silly and contrived plot about an extremely annoying photographer abandoned by her husband and forced to take anti depressants to survive and a bunch of talking heads going on about how quantum physics supposedly justifies their new agy pseudo philosophy basically if you start your day off meditating to the likes of enya and kenny g this movie is for you if you have a sense of humor a crowd of people who know how to have fun and a sizable portion of good weed then this movie is for you as well otherwise stay away take my word for it br br the first thing that struck me about what the bleep do you know is that is seemed to be edited and put together by the same kinds of people that shoot cheap weddings on camera complete with pink heart effects computer generated sparkles across the screen and other assorted silliness who let these people anywhere near a theatrical release is a mystery to me i guess this is what too much kenny g does to you the movie was permeated with cheesy gci the likes that you or i can produce on our own computer via over the counter video editing software but never would because it's just way too ridiculous br br the script was obviously written by someone with no writing experience whatsoever not only were all the characters and conversations cumbersome and contrived beyond belief but the writers felt like they had to shove every relevant piece of information or rather disinformation which is what most of this movie was all about all the way down your throat well given the target audience that may not have been too bad of an idea the main character for example spends half the movie popping pills apparently though it was deemed not convincing enough so there are at least a couple of dialogs in throughout which refer to her anti anxiety pills specifically just in case the viewers should not be able to connect her overacted pain and suffering with little white pills she takes whenever she feels down the acting well i've seen better acting in ed wood movies and no this is not an exaggeration heck the little play i was in when i was 12 featured much more inspiring acting than this it really did br br the story is interrupted here and there with a bunch or random talking heads a strange mix of kooky scientists kooky doctors and self proclaimed mystics go on and on about how quantum physics supposedly provides an explanation for how ever man or woman created their own reality just by participating in the experience of life reality you see is a probability field of a bunch of different possibilities and is only set in stone once you the observer chose to notice it what happens when more than one observer observes they didn't say but then again who cares listen to enya meditate observe and you shall be god and nobody gives a damn about such silly and archaic things as critical thinking logic etc all reason is immediately dismissed as people being stuck in their ways and unable to achieve a paradigm shift and go down the rabbit hole furthermore the heidelberg uncertainty principle supposedly is proof positive of alternate realities parallel universes and such br br speaking of rabbit holes the analogy permeates the movie all of these people keep talking about going down rabbit holes i'm not sure what that had to do with anything else they were saying or showing but one thing i'm certain of is that it somehow involves anal sex actually the movie is extremely anti sex throughout sex is presented as dirty ugly and anti enlightening br br in any case the talking heads talk the main character achieves harmony and enlightenment by painting hearts all over her body with a magic marker and proceeds to walk around with an even stupider look in her glazed over eyes than she started with br br i want 2 hours of my life back br br here's a couple of random quotes which i happened to remember br br what i think of as unreal has become a lot more real to me and that which i used to consider real is oftentimes a lot less real than the unreal some talking head on the spirituality of quantum physics br br what does it take for one man to have an erection it takes just one thought nothing changes on the outside all the changes are within an yet he has an erection some self proclaimed mystic head of her own school of enlightenment br br while looking at herself in the mirror i hate you i hate you you're fat you're ugly i have you main character the fat and ugly photographer
i resisted seeing this movie and i understand why it was not a big hit in theatres october sky feels and looks oh so familiar and it is all plot contrivances and emotions have been explored before in other films and possibly even better but despite it's familiarity and resistance to all formulas hollywood this movie is winning and likeable at every turn br br sputnik is the inspiration for this journey of the heart mind and soul just as the characters from steven sondheim's musical merrily we roll along stood agape atop their apartment roof hoping it would launch their new generation what do you call it you call it a miracle sputnik has a similar affect on the young rocket boys of this true tale while jaded townsfolk of their 1950's coal town dismiss the event homer hickham sees sputnik as his ticket out of a life in the mines br br masterful direction and casting make the journey of rocket boy homer and his pals seem fresh and new especially affecting are subplots concerning homer's ailing young school teacher remarkable restraint is shown in depicting their delicate relationship also remarkable is the father son supblot that anchors the film perfectly played all around even homer's mom gets her moment without cliche or intrusion her ultimatum to her husband is both dignified and heatbreaking myrtle beach says it all br br a major video chain i despise has a sign next to this film stating that you'll love this film or they'll refund your money for once i agree with them you'll never look at the october sky quite the same again br br
there is a bit of a spoiler below which could ruin the surprise of the one unexpected and truly funny scene in this film there is also information about the first film in this series br br i caught this film on dvd which someone gave as a gift to my roommate it came as a set together with the first film in the blind dead series br br this movie was certainly much worse than the first la noche del terror ciego in addition many of the features of the first movie were changed significantly to boot the movie was dubbed in english the first was subtitled which i tend to find distracting br br the concept behind the series is that in the distant past a local branch of the knights templar was involved in heinous and secret rituals upon discovery of these crimes the local peasantry put the templars to death in such a manner that their eyes can no longer be used thus preventing them from returning from hell to exact their revenge we then jump to modern times where because of some event the templars arise from the dead to exact their revenge upon the villagers whose ancestors messed them up in the first place of course since the undead knights have no eyes they can only find their victims when they make some sort of noise br br the templars were a secretive order from about the 12th century coming out of the crusades they were only around for about 150 years before they were suppressed in the early 1300s by the pope and others because they were secretive there were always rumors about their ceremonies particularly for initiation also because of the way the society was organized you didn't necessarily have church officials overseeing things which meant they didn't have an inside man when things heated up and because of the nature of their trials they were tortured into confessions the order was strongest in france but did exist in portugal and spain where the movies take place br br where the first movie had a virgin sacrifice and knights drinking the blood directly from the body of the virgin breast shots here of course this is a horror film after all and then once the knights come back to life they attack their victims by eating them alive and sucking their blood in this sequel this all disappears you still have the same scene redone not the same footage of them sacrificing the virgin but they drain the blood into a bowl and drink it from that thus when they come back they just hack people up with their swords or claw people to death which i have to say is a much less effective means of disturbing your audience there's also a time problem in the first film the dating is much closer to the templars where here they are now saying it is the 500 anniversary of the peasants burning these guys at the stake which would date it around 1473 and the way that the templars lose their eyes is much less interesting as well in the first they have them pecked out by crows now they are simply burned out and in quite a ridiculous manner br br oh yeah and maybe it was just me but there seemed to be a lot of people from the first movie reappearing in this film despite having died not really a problem since the movie is completely different and not a sequel in the sense of a continuation but odd none the less br br the highlight of this movie is the rich fellow who uses a child to distract the undead while he makes a break for the jeep the child's father had already been suckered by this rich man into making an attempt to get the jeep so he walks out and tells her to find her father it comes somewhat out of the blue and is easily the funniest scene in the film of course why the child doesn't die at this point is beyond me and disappointed for horror fans br br i couldn't possibly recommend this film to anyone it isn't so bad that it becomes funny so it just ends up being a mediocre horror film the bulk of the film has several people holed up in a church each making various attempts to go it alone in order to escape the blind dead who have them surrounded when the film ends you are not surprised at the outcome at all in fact quite disappointed if you are into the novelty of seeing a spanish horror film see the first movie which at least has some innovative ideas and not so expected outcomes
warning review contains slight spoilers br br there's a parallel universe out there where gone in 60 seconds is a dark edgy controversial independent movie unfortunately in this dimension gone is a flashy vacuous testosterone fuelled moronfest starring nicolas cage br br for reasons not really worth getting into he and his large number of cronies have four days to steal fifty expensive cars only one of which has an alarm this crew consists of the guy with the funny shaped ears who's rumoured to be the new superman a guy who conducted electricity in the x files an ex professional footballer and two token black men br br their enemies are cops rival car thieves and bilborough from cracker his manchester accent suitably flattened and broadened for american audiences who are now used to that sort of thing since daphne in frasier there's also angelina jolie who gets no character save to be a receptacle to men's sexual desires she and cage are supposed to be old flames which is odd as they never have anything approaching a normal conversation in all of the film's overlong 135m running time br br in fact characterisation is so poor that whenever anyone has a moment a violin plays in the background to accentuate the emotion it's no spoiler to reveal that vinnie jones who recreates his famous paul gasgoine hand ball manoeuvre and is quite menacing when silent only gets one line not because his inability to speak is integral to the plot but because his eloquent summing up of the film's dubious morality after appearing mute the whole way through is funny allegedly after he struggles through it in his not quite acting but it'll do london drawl cage quips i always thought you were from long island my ribs as you might imagine were well and truly tickled br br in fact humour is the most undeveloped aspect from the tactless comedy policeman to the two token black characters this sees the biggest aspect of hollywood take hold why is it that a black man cannot appear in a major motion picture without being constantly aware of his skin tone and endlessly refer to it the younger man who like the elder jive talks for the whole duration proclaims us black people don't like the cold we're tropical people he then goes on to express an urge to smoke a joint and watch roots he is of course parodying the image of black people but how funny is that his older counterpart cannot speak without referring to himself and thereby his colour in third person my black ass this my black ass that does anyone know any black people who actually speak like that thought not br br the film's soundtrack is played almost non stop and with increasing volume some of the tracks especially apollo 440's don't stop the rock so loud they're actually more audible than the sound effects and dialogue the surroundsound system even separates the two to such a degree that it makes them sound like two different films running together no background music concept here it's the aural equivalent of trying to watch a film while someone at the back of the cinema has their stereo turned up full blast keep that music down young man br br this isn't the worst film in the world and in many ways i enjoyed it it's just that it's predictable lazy and witless with minimal effort in its construction apparently box office expectations are considerably down for this movie after being force fed junk for several years it appears the general public are starting to wake up to the fact
what more could i say the americans totally hated it because the u s cut was so bad although you could detect the underlying goodwill in it br br talking about the u s theatrical release along with the newly released blu ray disc version it's faster and tighter than hk cut the background musics were all changed from the dark grim hk musics to hip hop musics and there were a lot of gruesome scenes cut out though the dubbing was a notable job given that they tried to capture the original actor's voice and tone but the problem is hak hap black mask the movie was designed and meant to be dark grim super disturbing and totally gruesome very unfortunately the u s release just skimmed the cream they wanted which in return completely changed the movie's undertone hk release was rated 18 to be even more comical and amateurish br br now let's talk about the original hk release this movie is like a hidden gem a prototype for the whole matrix tide and era the fighting scenes are totally awesome even the camera works were a bit old school among hk movies however the style the movie created was a unique blend of kungfu and pop culture with all the leather black costumes and decorations this movie features a batman like superhero in a black mask against a run of the mill gang of multinational super soldiers lead by a punk heavy metal rock star boss yes it sounds like imaginations of a retarded child but it works it's so impressive that the whole movie's gonna give you nightmares featuring foreigners fighting a bloodbath battle in leather coats in year 2002 they made a sequel which had a pg 13 rating but without jet li and liu qing yun and you know how bad that was because li and liu were the core characters in the movie and had strong personalities and an interesting friendship and did i happen to mention francois yip her roundhouse kick was totally cool even cooler than the villain boss because she didn't use a stuntman for all the fighting did i mention she was also smoking hot anyway there are a lot of things to like about the movie br br however the movie also suffered from a lot of problems first off it's a mediocre script made at its best potential which means this production team deserved a better screen writer there are a lot climaxes in the entire 100 minutes but they often felt like far fetched and don't totally make senses to the audiences us version was even worse because all the character developments were cut anyway you can't ask too much out of a comic inspired action movie also this movie is entirely improper for children i won't recommend it to you if you are less than 20 years old it's saturated with disturbing contents including blood gore sado maso costumes extreme brutal violence and so on along with the style of the movie it can be called a wet dream for heavy metal rock music fans and action fans the u s cut was milder but if you want to see it see the hk release for what it is 7 10 status inspiring hidden undervalued adult
a mix of comedy romance music action and horror a knockout this is one of the reasons people rave about hong kong cinema if you're looking for something totally original look no further entertainment at it's peak
i like silent films but this was a little too moronic as much as i wish i could say that it was worth the hour i stood up i can't i don't think any version of the movie even comes close to the book and don't try it out on kids they might freak and the lady who played pollyanna how old was she 38 i know the labor laws were different back then but come on people
if you want to learn the basics of quantum mechanics spend your 9 on a used textbook not this movie i'm a little worried that the money i spent is being used to buy kool aid for shipment to guyana br br i don't think the directors really got any point across but it looks like maybe they were trying to make several 1 science can explain everything we do meaning that our lives are deterministic 2 science can't be used to explain everything we do meaning that we have free will 3 science is like really cool brother 4 we are god 5 the world exists only in our minds 6 sarah norman is a tough role to follow and 7 here put this tiny paper square in your mouth and you'll see some really groovy stuff
there has never been anything like it that's for sure this episodic seemingly redundant trilogy only really makes sense taken as a whole and as such it is not a movie about groovin' gary utah cross dressing sensation it is very self consciously a film about how the filmmaker reacts to groovin' gary for harris the entire project is clearly an extended and spectacular contortion of guilt and repentance he's trying to atone for his sins yes gary did attempt suicide after the initial doc was aired through correction commentary and convention reclaiming such hollywood narrative standbys as the best friend and the defiant happy ending two different ones with a telling adjustment in the glover version and turning them to his own very personal uses so while thematically it remains a movie about gender and difference the structure ensures that it is also a movie about movies but on an almost unprecedented level of complexity there is just so much going on in telling and re telling this story harris is in the right place at the right time three times in a row and he doesn't miss the opportunity to make something of it immensely moving and as profound as camp ever gets
there was nothing about this movie that i liked it was so obviously low budget with bad lighting and camera work almost like blair witch project only it wasn't supposed to be that way there wasn't really much to the plot and the movie just drug on and on i actually fast forwarded through the last 1 3 of the movies but that did not help matters much it looked like it might be good from the box but i must say again nothing about this movie even resembled good no good actors the special effects were so fake the camera work was horrible and the dialogue was painfully terrible on my own personal scale i give this movie a 0 of 10 yikes
a guy thing tries to capture the feeling of there's something about mary or meet the parents but comes off more like it was edited up out of cutting room rejects of those two films thankfully i rented it on a 5 day rental because i couldn't sit and watch more than 20 minutes at a time br br the premise is decent and i liked the scenes where other guys automatically cover up for paul's missteps the checker at the save mart was great but the script writing is absolutely horrible the dialog falls flat most of the time and just when you think that things are finally going to get on track some needless sight gag is stuck in for no good reason plus how many toilet jokes does one movie really need br br don't get me wrong slapstick humor is great when it's smartly done as in the other films i mentioned but this movie simply misses the mark too bad as i love julia stiles ten things i hate about you was great but even that couldn't help me sit through this terrible movie save your dollars and go rent there's something about mary one more time
i have to say the worst part of the movie was the first half hour i was really confused about who was who for example bill paxson's character had long hair and was wearing a jacket then when all the males arrived at camp it turned out there was a character who looked like bill paxson but wasn't i said where's bill paxson then there was a guy with his girlfriend he said she was 21 this was supposed to be a 20 year reunion of the camp director's alan arkin most memorable later on this same girl was interacting and talking about her camp experiences that made no sense she would have been one years old that said the movie turned out to be pretty good kevin pollak was the nice guy who was always being teased one guy was a complete narcissist and ended up losing his beautiful girlfriend alan arkin was interesting as an old style camp director who admits that he has grown out of touch with modern youth the best part was that none of the grown up campers were successes in life none of them had very great careers this seemed very real life the movie was compared to the big chill in some ways it wasn't as exciting as the big chill but it was a lot more realistic so even though the beginning is not promising the movie ended up turning into a pretty good one
this movie is being shown over and over on cable lately so br br there is no excuse for these 2 attractive women to fight over either luke wilson or the equally vapid 'villian' in this movie the female actresses are very cute and that's the only reason to watch this movie i suppose it is 'funny' that luke's even uglier dorkier stupider friend is around but well that is what we get br br neither of the female leads would ever ever talk to any of the males in this movie for more than 5 minutes what we get is them sobbing and crying and fighting and so on over 2 guys that were best described in friday the 13th 4 dead
william wyler was to have directed this adaptation of moss hart's hit broadway play with music recruiting poster vivant but his own military commitments intervened and it went to a most unlikely helmsman george cukor the women's director has a sure touch on the many documentary like sequences of air corps training and he invests it with more unhackneyed humanity than the genre generally allowed particularly in wartime sure the gee whiz and entirely white save for one unbilled chinese american recruit bunch of newbies are nicer and more wholesome than in real life and the speechifying about home and mom and the wife and kid gets pretty thick but it's efficient propaganda and undeniably stirring notable too for the all military male cast several of whom didn't reemerge for years lon mcallister edmond o'brien martin ritt red buttons in drag as an andrews sister peter lind hayes karl malden kevin mccarthy gary merrill lee j cobb and don taylor also for a very early glimpse of judy holliday who doesn't show up till an hour and a half into the picture but has some good little sequences as o'brien's worried sick brooklyn spouse too bad its rights are in a tangle and the only print anyone knows of is 16mm evidently after twentieth century fox released it to considerable success the rights reverted to the army and if there's a good 35mm print out there it probably lies somewhere in the bowels of the pentagon it's disingenuous and corny in spots but it also captures the rigors of military training and the terrors of war vividly and it deserves to be more widely seen
this film is really terrible terrible as in it is a waste of 84 minutes of your life special effects are so terrible the acting wasn't convincing br br its about a crocodile that attack a view tourists as they are filming a documentary about blood surfing blood surfing is when they surf around sharks but it turns terrible wrong when a 31 foot crocodile interrupts there holiday the sharks don't look real the crocodile is even worse and it gets even more pathetic when they are running away form the creature but the crocodile gets stuck and 2 females flash it the deaths are fake and the pirates are just to fill in time br br a pointless terrible film thats not worth seeing
for those that were interested in knowing how exactly humanity came to be encased in big red pods that make me crave pomegranate there is the duo of the second renaissance shorts i'm not exactly sure why they are split into two parts especially since they're credited as one on the dvd and are these shorts viewed on any other format but the dvd but they're informative even if they have a few gaps br br what really makes this first part stand out from the second part and the rest of the animations as well is the parallels it shows between robot uprising and civil rights graphic homages to slavery fascism concentration camps and mass graves are mixed with verbal references to the million man march and humanity's god complex in fact god is never really referenced by these shorts instead replaced by man's own image br br as far as the shorts go in the collection the second renaissance part i is by far the most effective in bringing out emotion it's a sorrowful and disturbing view of the potential of humanity to become the architect of its own destruction some may be turned off by some of the concepts this short rips directly out of previously established science fiction literature but then again that's basically what most of the matrix series has done and it's been a driving force behind its success br br polarisdib
sean you know i think that you are absolutely the greatest actor in the world but i can't commend you for this comedy just isn't your strong suit br br however it wasn't all your fault some of the stuff was just too hard to understand alfred lynch did a decent job but you gotta wonder where the lines came from from the beginning br br once again sean i apologize
the one sheets and newspaper campaign suggested as often they did a far more lurid and violent piece than showed up on the drive in screens claude brook is actually an americanization of claudio brook who worked in films for years this one's quite hard to find anymore i'd love to see it again to compare it to other international horrors of the day but don't remember particularly impressed way back when chances are it was a chopped up version that made it to u s theatres and video but oh that one sheet still a gem of my later horror collection
pet sematary is a very good horror film and believe it or not somebody can make a good horror film out of a stephen king novel mary lambert does a great job with this film and manages to bring across king's creepy story pretty well most people may avoid this but they should check it out
i went to see this movie twice within a week and can only sum it up in one word which i normally don't use lightly wonderful in my view the best movie ever made who deserves oscars and other awards if not this swedish crew who have created cinematic perfection in the last scenes of the film when everything that is said and left unsaid throughout the story is drawn together just as the character of daniel dareus evokes so many sentiments and long repressed feelings within the people around him the movie does the same to its viewers you walk out with your head abuzz and your heart feeling full great stuff next time you ask yourself what is the meaning of life perhaps think about how you feel after a sumptuous experience like as it is in heaven happy content fulfilled to say it with virginia woolf's mrs dalloway such moments are enough
when i read the summary of the movie something like what happens when a man gets powers of a god and how he later learns that having supernatural powers requires giant responsibility and strength i though that was clever and original concept casting was promising too carrey freeman aniston how can movie with a good idea and good actors not to mention costs of filming can be bad it can idea is good but script and story itself is terrible bruce nolan is let's be honest a pretty mediocre journalist with not exactly great stories like a story of a giant cookie what a faux pas and the niagara report is complete fiasco he's a man with a job he completely deserves he's not a good journalist he's a comedian considering his potentials with a nice home sugar sweet girlfriend and oh horror dog who is not house trained yes as soon as bruce at the beginning of the movie starts addressing god in a god why do you hate me manner average viewer must think why what's wrong with your life bruce bruce is not and definitely not the man with real problems in life most the troubles that happen to him are minor and not really worth of all that fuss he makes and some of them are really only the result of his stupidity most people have really big problems worth of attention most people are more worth of attention that bruce who doesn't seem too human after all doesn't look even realistic too goofy and neurotic but god still addresses to him why though morgan freeman looks nice as a god i can't help but to ask what is he doing in this particularly bad movie and what does bruce do when god gives him his powers god in this movie could as easily give his powers to a 5 year old kid and there hardly would be any difference no wait a smart kid would probably use his god powers better than bruce what does bruce do pulls the moon closer to earth to create romantic atmosphere parts the red soup lifts up a pretty woman's dress on the street answers prayers via e mail and make all of them come true no more bruce please what bruce did could actually end the world but in the movie that doesn't happen because this is nice family little movie and doesn't make any sense at all not a hint of sarcasm of real humor of wittiness of some dirty humor at least nothing just carrey playing silly which is starting to look pathetic on middle aged actor aniston here is understated she plays pale undeveloped character of bruce's girlfriend grace and stays completely forgettable in this movie nobody in the right mind would believe that this two have any chemistry at all between them when grace says prayer for bruce it sounds not only lame and pathetic but completely false these two are not meant to be together i would give three stars but i doubt movie deserves a one bad script lame dialogs lack of real humor wittiness and any sophistication as well as undeveloped characters and understated freeman's and aniston's roles total lack of boldness and sarcasm it all makes movie hardly worth but ok there were few funny moments and freeman is always nice to see in any movie so lets leave three stars
savage island 2003 is a lame movie it's more like a home video shot with very minimal lighting and horrid acting not only that the storyline and script was wretched i don't know why this movie was made i have seen a lot of flicks in my time and the ones i really hate are movies that make me angry this one made my blood boil the situations were inane at best if i made a movie like this it would have been a short really because those backwood idjits wouldn't have been in the picture br br don't be fooled by the cover on the d v d i am an avid watcher of bad cinema but this movie is virtually unwatchable i don't mind movies being shot on d v but if you're going to do that make the movie enjoyable not some tired retread of superior horror films sans wrong turn br br i have to not recommend this waste of disk if you come across this one in the rental store pass on by br br movies that make yours truly angry get an automatic 1
i think that most of the folks who have posted comments on this movie don't understand how to watch a movie and or have little sense of elegance first to assess a movie you need to understand the extent to which everything in the film works together modern sensibilities demand great drama no i don't mean great setting of characters and plots but they seem to demand emotional trajectories that are greatly tragic or greatly comedic this is a subtle movie its beauty lies in its subtlety not to be confused with simplicity neither the story nor the characters are simple in this movie it is a beautifully filmed movie that makes the most of combining sensuousness politics human weakness venality you name it the world it's set in would be alien and not understood today a world where if you have it you have to flaunt it now and loudly even if you only think you have it br br many people today don't understand that victorian society wasn't really victorian as people understand that term today br br this movie helps set the record straight
i can't recommend this film as a date movie gary oldman's semi autobiographical account of life lived on a south east london estate is a violent beckettian account of one of dante's circles of hell frankly at the centre of it is ray winstone who has done this sort of character before but never as well the film opens with him ordering drinks at a pub bar that's all and you are already gripped with a sense of the frustration self loathing and barbarism that he exhibits in many different ways throughout the course of the movie it's an acting masterclass br br of course the stymied and dispossessed need a foil in a drama such as this and winstone is matched by kathy burke as his long suffering wife who absorbs and ultimately rejects his unbearable behaviour charlie creed miles does an able turn as the fuse lighting druggie son billy although he must have wondered sometimes exactly what he let himself in for gary oldman directs close up on the actors maximising the claustrophobia of their council flat squalor 4 10
this video was my first exposure to eddie izzard we had several friends over one night and for some reason or another had channel surfed to hbo during the course of the evening someone by the name of eddie izzard was on i tried not to laugh too loudly at the first few jokes i didn't want to be held responsible for the rest of the group's enjoyment of something that was obviously killing me after holding in my laughs for more than was healthful i let go as did the others of us we were not stoned by the way nor talking of insurance and pensions we were asphyxiated after that the story lines the plot the bizarre yet ingenious connections throughout the sketches are nothing short of brilliance i have since been addicted to every eddie izzard piece of comedy i can get my hands on his work is sheer genius his comedy appears effortless he seems more like that hysterically funny friend hanging out at your house and rambling on about this or that it's convulsively funny he gives you the impression that the joke is between you and himself the only true aficionados of humor after all if you are disappointed in this video you have no sense of the penultimate in humor or humour as they say in the uk
well when watching this film late one night i was simple amazed by it's greatness fantastic script great acting costumes and special effects and the plot twists wow in fact if you can see the ending coming you should become a writer yourself br br great i would recommend this film to anyone especially if i don t like them much br br terrific
20 out of 10 this is a truly wonderful story about a wartime evacuee and a curmudgeonly carpenter tom oakley the boy william beech is billeted with tom and it is immediately apparent that he has serious issues when he wets his bed on the first night william is illiterate and frightened but somehow the two find solace in each others loneliness it transpires that william has a talent as an artist and we see tom's talent as a choirmaster in an amusing rendition of jerusalem william is befriended by zacharias wrench a young jewish lad also from london and along with both tom and zacharias he finally learns to read and write and to feel a part of this small close knit community just as he is settling down william is recalled back to london by his mother and it is here we see why he is so screwed up his mother is clearly mentally sick and when tom doesn't hear from william he travels to london to look for him he finally finds him holding his dead baby sister where he has been tied up in a cellar after a period in hospital tom realises he must kidnap him and take him home with him the climax is a bitter sweet ending when william is told he is to be adopted by tom while at the same time learning his best friend zacharias has been killed in an air raid in london for me one of the most moving scenes was when tom was talking to a official from the home office br br i love 'im an' for what it's worth i think he loves me too' br br it just doesn't get better that that does it
there's so many negative reviews about stay away joe in here i just can't stay quiet any longer and let this injustice happen here's a side you haven't heard yet br br elvis presley's movies are my guilty pleasure for a simple reason they are perfect films for a pure relaxation because i don't have to think when i watch them that means i don't have to worry about missing a complex plot because there never is a proper plot to start with i can just kick off my shoes grab a beer sit back switch off my brains and enjoy all the general wackiness and catchy easy going rock n' roll tunes from the grooviest decade of them all br br in my books stay away joe definitely falls into the so bad it's good category now if you're like me and appreciate the trash value this is the ultimate 1960's camp experience it's so bad that it's almost surrealistic to watch and just when you think that it can't possibly get any worse it surprises you in the most imaginable ways in the end you're so amazed by all the new levels of stupidity you just don't know whether to laugh or cry in a nutshell i love it because it's so damn amusing that there once was a generation that actually made films like this i still give it 1 out of 10 though once it hits the bottom 100 it will became an instant bad movie classic
if john waters had written and directed house of 1000 corpses after being struck about the head repeatedly with a heavy object the result would probably be something like the blood shed it's mildly entertaining for the first half hour but then it slides into a sort of featureless glop of constant screaming and people doing things to each others genitalia with electric carving knives cutlery and pliers susan adriensen sno cakes is incredibly annoying and terry west elvis bullion is almost as bad in whatever it is he's doing in front of the camera br br maybe the best thing about the blood shed is that it won't take most viewers very long to forget about it
the production quality cast premise authentic new england waterbury ct locale and lush john williams score should have resulted in a 3 4 star collectors item unfortunately all we got was a passable 2 star decent flick mostly memorable for what it tried to do bring an art house style film mainstream the small town locale and story of ordinary people is a genre to itself and if well done will satisfy most grownups jane fonda was unable to hide her braininess enough to make her character believable i wondered why she wasn't doing a post doctorate at yale instead of working in a dead end factory job in waterbury robert diniro's character was just a bit too contrived an illiterate nice guy loser who turns out to actually be with a little help from jane's character a 1990 version of henry ford or thomas edison br br this genre has been more successfully handled by nobody's fool in the mid 90s and this year's 2003 about schmidt i wish that the main stream studios would try more stuff for post adolescents and reserve a couple of screens at the multi cinema complexes for those efforts br br i'll give it an a for effort
as i am always looking for something new and unique i watched this film online i thought that it would be just another b rate movie but i was amazed at the acting by the two main characters all of the actors in this film were very capable and well directed the plot was wonderful and unique as well with an excellent moral to the story br br this movie is definitely not for someone looking for a sex romp dumb and dumber or blood and guts this is a wonderfully poignant film showing some grim realities of life coupled with the kindness of the human heart and just enough frivolity to keep it interesting br br i would prefer this movie to many a rate movies i have seen even a great number with high box office earnings br br i highly recommend this movie
it is incredible in that it succeeds in being terrible on so many levels the script the acting the directing and the choice of cast are all appalling the costumes sets and pseudo medieval language are also utterly awful in an odd way i actually enjoyed this film once i had accepted that it wasn't going to be any good it seems a shame that people would spend so much time and effort producing something so poor when really they could have made something pretty decent out of the premise albeit not very believable but instead we are treated to a rather nauseating and cheesy tale of dragons and knights that lacks any of the charm to be found in other such fantasy films let's just hope that the lord of the rings is a bit better oh and david thewlis' haircut makes him look like he man it does
mainly because ju on 2 boasts an outrageous forty minutes' worth of material literally taken straight out of the first ju on and when you consider that the sequel only runs for 76 minutes that leaves you with 36 original minutes' worth of film ho hum i found that deeply irritating as if viewers simply wouldn't remember the same stuff not to mention dull having to watch it all over again br br ok that complaint aside the byline for ju on 2 was that it was supposed to explain a lot of the unanswered questions from the first movie which frankly over 36 minutes simply doesn't go far enough to making any kind of sense of the original's highly convoluted storyline br br there are however some really nice new horror sequences which show how good the film might have been had it had some time to develop and some of the questions raised by the original some but not all are answered br br so in conclusion if you loved the first original movie and want to see some further developments on the story go for it but just remember to keep your remote control to hand with your finger on the fast forward button for forty minutes
michael caton jones's scottish period piece bears little connection to the sir walter scott novel of the same name br br the film opens in the scottish highlands with robert roy mcgregor and his men hunting down a bunch of cow thieves who have stolen several heads of his lordship james graham's cattle the scene then switches to a sword fighting contest attended by noblemen with longhair wigs adorned shirts soft colored coats paleface make up and conventional gestures br br macgregor lives under the protection of a local lord named marquis of montrose when he enters an ill advised trade agreement with montrose he innocently leaves himself exposed to the malicious plots of montrose's evil doers the unfolding of their perfidy is the most creative and pleasant part of the movie though it takes a repugnant turn with a violent rape when rob roy is finally compelled to rebel against the english soldiers the action becomes well understood ending with the predictable duel between him and an expert with the blade br br liam neeson injects heroism and passion to his character he is intelligent fair and virile he carries his height with grace as the scottish chieftain of a small community he is a loving father a passionate lover and a noble husband driven to desperate acts by dastardly villains he'd rather die than tell a lie or betray a trust br br oscar winner jessica lange gives the film class as the strong robust devoted wife a proud peasant woman brutally raped by an icy psychotic aristocrat lange's lines are filled with dignity and integrity 'i will think on you dead until my husband makes you so and then i will think on you no more ' br br john hurt brings his usual clever touch with character roles to make montrose something more than a greedy marquis ruthless with money and tempered by the english court's fashion for foppery he is a pompous arrogant man with two villainous servants at his service honor in his view seems a quaint notion he has two objectives ruin the reputation of his rival the duke of argyle and to hunt down the fugitive macgregor he sends his soldiers to burn the highlanders' homes to kill their people and their livestock br br tim roththe perfect antithesis to the hero is fearsome and strangely an effeminate enforcer he is a penniless british aristocrat a nasty 'hired sword' wonderfully evil ravishing and murdering his way through the scottish mist his name is archibald cunningham he turns out to be a liar a thief and a murderer he dismisses himself as 'but a bastard abroad seeking his fortune and the favors of great men and therefore can't care about anyone else love is a dung hill and i am but a cock that climbs upon it to crow he even jokes that he once raped a young boy whom he mistook for a girl br br cunningham seems pathetic he smiles foolishly and utters words with affected refinement but not terribly harmful until a muscular swordsman insults him and we discover that he's a cool head and an expert with a sword he really does steal the film with a performance that earned him a best supporting actor nomination br br and while brian cox is suitably odious as killearn andrew keir is montrose's rival the powerful local aristocrat the duke of argyll one of the few trustworthy men mcgregor meets outside his own family br br set in 18th century scotland and with an atmospheric musical score 'rob roy' is really a love story between a man and his wife a recognizably human story unjustly dwarfed by mel gibson's 'braveheart ' that does tell essentially the same story of provincial resentment of overbearing english landlords
i saw this movie just now not when it was released and hailed as best picture of the year here in israel and to summarize everything right now i will just say this is not a good film br br this is dror shaul's second feature film and i have to admit that his first and the tv drama he made before this picture are much better further more this is his first attempt at directing a drama the early works were comedies and were funny and effective br br the first thing you have to know if you'll ever see this film israel of the 21st century hates the kibbutz and the values it represented since the formation of the state of israel the real situation of the kibbutzim is very dire and some of them disappear one by one the kibbutz hebrew word for collective was a sort of village for members only where the values of equality and socialism were the dogma for everyday life with the change in social values with time it seems now that the kibbutz was a place where the human spirit was repressed locked within the dogma rules with no ticket out the entrance of capitalist values and way of life in the 90's and so far made it very hard on the kibbutzim to survive the crazy mother in the film is the central metaphor for that br br but i regard this film as having nothing to do with nostalgia for the good old days of the kibbutz once it was a dream of every young couple to live in a kibbutz and raise children in this quite and beautiful environment but the film shows the opposite that the kibbutz with it's socialist dogma was a place sort of like a cult of crazy people with crazy ideas that undermine the freedom of each individual within the collective this is the central philosophy of post modern capitalism your individuality is the most important thing you must place yourself in the center and no one else but you is the matter this is the philosophy the film stands for and that's just it's first sin br br if you disagree with me on the political side i'm sure you will agree that the acting the tone of the film it's script and it's direction are the four sins that follow the film has no real visual text and none of it's shots is something to remember it is also very delicate a delicacy that is no more than artsy fartsy attempt to provoke emotions which do not surface not in the film and not with the viewer it brings nothing but boredom br br can someone please explain why this film won so many prizes maybe because it shows that israel is in line with the rest of the world hating socialist and human values or maybe it shows that israel is a delicate place not giving in to dogmas and fanaticism that we are basically very human and good people capable of emotions especially when they are fake ones just like capitalism expects us to be or maybe because it tells one of the biggest lies of israeli cinema in recent years a lie that undermines the justification of the existence of the jewish state no matter what the answer is it's not a good one not for the world not for human values and not for the jews
tim gary daniels wants desperately to break into serious television reporting when a job he begged for goes awry he is fired his beautiful but empty girlfriend elizabeth hurley says sayonara too coming home tim is startled to discover his house has an uninvited visitor christopher lloyd from the planet mars calling him uncle martin tim soon tries to help his new friend navigate life on earth but martin gets in trouble wherever he goes from the bathroom to the laundry room and more lovely lizzie daryl hannah finally sees an opportunity to make time with tim but the course of true love does not run smooth in this case either soon everyone in television is stalking tim hoping for a story about a true alien what's a man to do for those who loved the old television show of the same name with bill bixby and ray walston this film is not worthy to tie the proverbial boots its truly undeniably awful with no plot and a reliance on supposed special effects which fall flat too daniels is okay as the earthling but lloyd is simply terrible as the alien overacting up a storm the rest of the cast is adequate as are the costumes set and production details even if your children see the cover and beg for this film convince them to pick out another flick at the video store be assured kids and adults will find this movie a colossal bore so opt for a night at the museum or around the world in 80 days instead
i couldn't believe this terrible movie was actually made at all with the worst actors you could find the worst script written mark frost sollace mitchell and by far the worst waste of time in viewing i won't belabor the story as it's really not worth it but i will elaborate on some of the performances and definitely the story as to the story it is very hard to believe that this bitty crazy schemer could actually do what she did that in reality the wife couldn't defend herself against a little bitty of a thing that the husband could actually find the nut case attractive at all that the defense attorney could break every court rule there was and keep on doing it after the judge ordered the blankety blank to shut up and the final result of the film is an insult to justice movie codes and the male species the theme of this mess is let women do as they wish kill whom they want defend the killer and get away with it while the guy rots in jail the innocent victim hard to believe that sollace mitchell the director and a man would even want to make this dribble br br as to the acting jordan ladd the killer is awful a loony toons who does needlepoint during her murder trial is this allowed in court she bored me to the hilt one more look of her batting her eyes and indicating how innocent she was and i'd throw up she's not even attractive enough for any guy to leave his wife the husband played on one level by vincent spano just seems to look and act stupid most of the time he was so predictable in his performance falling into the traps set for him by all the women surrounding him the worst by far was holland taylor as the defense attourney she over acted throughout the film and made a mockery of justice if she would cross examine me anytime i'd have told her to go take a hike everybody else in this sleazy film did their job as directed to do so br br i wish i could give this film a zero rating however we are forced to start with 1 too bad let's not have anymore painful watching films like this lifetime can do better then this i know it br br this is a postscript made the mistake of turning this insipid movie on by mistake as soon as i saw the bimbo jordan ladd i knew i'd seen it before and didn't like it or her i not only turned the darn thing off but had to add my anger at people like sollace mitchell who wrote the screenplay but also directed this horrible flick doesen't anyone see that her his message is that sickness pays being ill and going around killing people is okay with this director writer totally making the male species idiots well this male tells you to go stuff it somewhere painful we're not all that stupid and will speak out to your so called movie which in this person's mind deserves to be trashed br br and again this loser is shown why can't you read the comments on this stupid and despicable movie are we constantly subjected to see the bimbo jordan ladd again and again get her off tv films and out of sight she's just terrible in every sense of the word phew
this movie is just bad bad bad bad now that i've gotten that out of the way i feel better this movie is poor from beginning to end the story is lame the 3 d segment is really bad freddy is at his cartoon character worst thank god they killed him off and who wants to see roseanne and tom arnold cameos br br the only good thing in the movie is the little bit of backstory that we're given on freddy we see he once had a family and we get to see his abusive alcoholic father alice cooper br br other than that all bad there are some quality actors in here lisa zane and yaphet kotto and they do their best but the end result is just so bad the hour and a half i spent watching this movie is and hour and half i can't ever get back
well let me just say something about these actors they really were a good decision and from experience having actors really brings the dialogue to life if you walk into this even fifteen minutes late you'll be in for a shock the movie will have already began you don't want to miss the first few jokes assuming you came to not miss any jokes br br wow i have never seen a movie that ended with such a final ending not to be harsh i mean i loved it but it just surprised me that it really kept going until it stopped but i'm getting ahead of myself lets start with the very start of it when it began the plot outline goes like this there is this man and not to give away any spoilers spoiler alert he hasn't had any sex ever they use this plot device to set the story moving and there are intentionally or not it could go either way some funny situations had by the main characters some containing irony and jokes and awkward situations you know br br the director uses the advancements in technology by combining the film shot on the set and scripted dialog some music and jokes to make a funny movie designed as a comedy where he takes us on a journey from the opening credits to the end with an entirely full movie in between i went into this movie expecting to see a funny comedy because of what i already knew about it and left feeling as though i had just left a theater that just played a funny comedy ten stars
some have praised atlantis the lost empire as a disney adventure for adults i don't think so at least not for thinking adults br br this script suggests a beginning as a live action movie that struck someone as the type of crap you cannot sell to adults anymore the crack staff of many older adventure movies has been done well before think the dirty dozen but atlantis represents one of the worse films in that motif the characters are weak even the background that each member trots out seems stock and awkward at best an md medicine man a tomboy mechanic whose father always wanted sons if we have not at least seen these before we have seen mix and match quirks before the story about how one companion vinny played by don novello fr guido sarducci went from flower stores to demolitions totally unconvincing br br only the main character milo thatch a young atlantis obsessed academic voiced by michael j fox has any depth to him milo's search for atlantis continues that of his grandfather who raised him the opening scene shows a much younger milo giddily perched on a knee as his grandfather places his pith helmet on his head br br and while the characters were thin at best the best part about atlantis was the voice talent perhaps milo's depth is no thicker than fox's charm commander rourke loses nothing being voiced by james garner although rourke is a pretty stock military type garner shows his ability to breath life into characters simply by his delivery garner's vocal performance is the high point i'm sorry to say leonard nimoy's dying king is nothing more than obligatory additionally don novello as the demolition expert vinny santorini was also notable for one or two well done funny lines but i've always liked father guido sarducci anyway br br also well done was the computer animation the background animation that is the character animation has not been this bad for disney since the minimalism that drove don bluth out the door the character animation does nothing if not make already flat characters appear even flatter aside from landscapes buildings and vehicles there isn't much to impress br br the plot was the worst some say hackneyed or trite i'm not so sure about that any serviceable plot can be made into something new with the proper treatment shakespeare often started from a known story and plot and was famous only for putting on a new coat of paint so the treatment is the thing and atlantis obviously lacks that br br i cannot begin to go into all the logic gaps without a spoiler section the plot was bad the plot's bridges snap like twine and the ending does not make sense to add to that the script and the animation is peppered with annoying sloppiness br br spoilers br br 1 right at the beginning when milo reveals that runic or celtic symbols have been wrongly transliterated and the coast of ireland should read the coast of iceland we begin to have problems the writers of the script would need to know the british take for eire or eireann as ireland and completely ignore the older latin term hibernia but more than this they need to know of the vikings conspiracy to call the greener island iceland and the icier island greenland br br by making it the matter of a mis tranliterated letter the writers have doomed themselves to requiring a runic version of english and a post roman date on the script since this is long after atlantis was supposed to have sunk into its undersea cave and without visible clues and less technology than milo had made the inscription far less trustworthy br br 2 the shepard's journal could not be written before the sinking of atlantis or it would know nothing about the cave or the crystal lying in the king's eye it must have been written after the sinking but without even the technology that milo's expedition had how the heck did anybody get by the leviathan so how could it know more about anything after that and why would it be written in atlantian br br automatic writing and clairvoyance or astral travel can explain these things however clairvoyance and astral travel do not require the shepard to write in atlantian so it's got to be some sort automatic writing since noone left in atlantis can read it must be the spirits of the crystal beaming messages to the surface this would have made more sense but could also have been explained within the movie milo could have discovered that this power had been calling him all his life appeared in dreams etc this needed to be explored in the movie br br 3 the atlantians should simply not be able to comprehend modern languages no one expects that the original indo europeans would be able to converse in europe anymore than romans would understand that hard c s or their day became french ch s pronounced like sh s no less br br 4 current atlantians were alive before the cataclysm when apparently they could read yet now are unable to read what they used to or operate similar machinery br br 5 the mass illiteracy points out a crucial flaw in the movie nothing seems to have happened to this culture it seems suspended in air until milo can rescue it even though it appears that life is not a constant struggle for survival no one wants to compose poetry or write novels and perhaps it is a combination of atlantian school systems going downhill toward the end and lack of good fiction that caused atlantis to fall into illiteracy br br 5 kida can be excused for not knowing how to read or operate the machinery if she was so young when the cataclysm of stupidity set in but any of it hardly qualifies her father for deification kashakim's foolishness almost single handedly wiped his people from existence killed a bunch in the cataclysm stalled progress not a lot killed here but he oversaw a massive slide in culture and progress until someone could take the crystal to kill everybody if they weren't boiled in lava first because the giant robots weren't there to protect them br br a bolt of blue electricity should have shattered kashakim's likeness when kida tried joining her father's image to the circle of great kings of atlantis br br 6 even though milo was the only one who could read atlantian rourke and others knew enough to look through a book of gibberish and find a page on a crystal which he knew to be a crystal and not some stylized astrological or phases of the sun diagram br br 7 if milo's grandfather had told rourke about it it still does not explain what how rourke would have suffered from milo's reading it as part of the book ripping out the page which was dog eared in rourke's hand even though milo found no sign of a torn page in the book apparently only was there to tip off the viewer that something was not quite right unless the word crystal would have set alarms off in milo's head that somebody would try to steal it milo would have suspected nothing it's just thick headed foreshadowing br br 8 the crew's double cross was not a character change we learned that vinny sweet audrey and cookie had been going along with rourke from the beginning however the change of heart falls flat it was a change and needed to be better motivated hard to do with characters who weren't given anything to begin with br br 9 niggling little bit that the lava flows up over the dome instead of filling in the rest of the area that we view the sequence from it's liquid it will not flow over the protective dome until it fills up all lower areas br br 10 the ending stinks and makes no sense other than to appease political correctness with it's powersource restored atlantis is no longer a weak power needing coddling the giant robot guardians and the sky cycles shooting blue lightning suggest that they have less to fear from us than they might the technology is superior to ours and definitely to early 20th century in the end milo needs to teach the atlantians to read for what the whole idea is to leave their little quiet chastened culture alone not to send it into hyperdrive br br end spoilers br br perhaps the lost world plot and the turn of the century setting should give me a hint that this is more an homage to pulps the failures i find with the film agree with this idea but i am at a loss why i should pay to see thin characters and plot holes simply because many dime novels had them as well and pulp stories is part of the crap they can't sell adults anymore anyway we have become a bit more sophisticated and our pulp needs to grow up as well raiders of the lost ark lost none of its pulp feel and avoided so much badness br br 4 out of 10 the movie is enjoyable but as i think about the plot it seeps ever lower
i personally hated this movie because it was predictable the characters were stereotypical and the whole idea was a rip off of the cutting edge and cadet kelly br br the main character is a snotty girl who gets shipped of to a place where she doesn't belong the whole place hates her and to make things worse there is a hot guy that seemingly doesn't like her well duh the whole damn school can't stand you amazingly she finds a way to fit in and make everyone to like her plus gets the guy to fall head over heels in love with her then comes the choice where she must choose between figure skating and hockey she chooses hockey then she goes to the figure skating nationals and gets to be on the olympic team no real surprise there br br this whole movie was so damn predictable you knew what was going to happen before you even saw it this was so awful i nearly puked and by the time i was finished watching it i had an awful headache and the urge to shoot myself for watching such crap don't watch this unless you are under ten or actually like crappy tween movies
despite some mildly thought provoking oddities in the script and the film's overall curiosity value fury of the wolfman emerges as a dull uninteresting excursion into lycanthropy saved only by the statuesque presence of villainess perla cristal the rest of the players including the hammy naschy are a complete write off though admittedly none are helped by often atrocious dubbing although the screenplay packs in enough variations on werewolf frankenstein dr moreau themes to flesh out a dozen movies the plot is so unevenly developed the characterizations so feeble and the dialogue so verbosely ridiculous at least in the english version that any latent interest in the turgid proceedings is soon quashed br br zabalza's direction seems jerky even amateurish his staging is clumsy and ineffective he is not helped by villasenor's over bright lighting even promising sets are so unatmospherically photographed that the director's few attempts to give the audience a fright are signaled far in advance br br other credits fall into a similar pattern of ineptitude though the stridently over emphatic music score and the laughably crude totally primitive special effects deserve special condemnation
a great concept gone wrong poor acting even worse writing after watching the first two episodes i was wondering why it ever made it to season two the characters are forgettable the writing is poor the sets are just ok the special effects are simply sad so much better has been made in the same time frame where is the money going on this one the first episode starts out interesting then goes downhill fast the precept of the whole show is just silly now don't get me wrong i am a huge sci fi fan and 'geek' but this show simply doesn't cut it as i said in the beginning i am truly surprised it made it to season two so much better has been canceled after only one season jake 2 0 for example this show was just bad
i have to say the first i watched this film was about 6 years ago and i actually enjoyed it then i bought the dvd recently and upon a second viewing i wondered why i liked it the acting was awful and as usual we have the stereo typical clansmen in their fake costumes the acting was awful at best tim roth did an ok job as did liam neeson but i've no idea what jessica lange was thinking br br the plot line was good but the execution was just poor i'm tired of seeing scotland portrayed like this in the films braveheart was even worse though which is this films only saving grace but seriously people didn't speak like that in those days why do all the actors have to have glaswegian accents just another film to try and capture the essence of already tired and annoying stereotypes i notice the only people on here who say this film is good are the americans and to be honest i can see why they'd like it i know they have an infatuation for men in kilts however if you are thinking of buying the dvd i'd say spend your money on something else like a better film
one can only imagine the film mr welles might have finished without the interference of the studio this film is a flawed welles but worth every minute of it because one can see the greatness of perhaps america's best motion picture director of all times br br we can see the toll it took on orson welles the filming of this movie the story has a lot of holes in it perhaps because of the demands of the studio executives that didn't trust the director br br it is curious by reading some of the opinions submitted to imdb that compare orson welles with the coen brothers roman polanski even woody allen when it should be all of those directors that must be regarded as followers of the great master himself no one was more original and creative in the history of american cinema than mr welles lucky are we to still have his legacy either in retrospective looks such as the one the film forum in new york just ended or his films either on tape or dvd form br br rita hayworth was never more lovingly photographed than here if she was a beauty with her red hair as a blonde she is just too stunning for words everett sloan and glenn anders made an excellent contribution to the movie br br the only thing that might have made this film another masterpiece to be added to orson welles body of work was his own appearance in it had he concentrated in the directing and had another actor interpret michael o'hara a different film might have been achieved altogether orson welles has to be credited for being perhaps a pioneer in taking the camera away from the studio lot into the street the visuals in this film are so amazing that we leave the theater after seeing this movie truly impressed for the work the vision and the talent he gave us
a handful of nonprofessional actors are terrorized by a prehistoric creature this creature appears in about thirty seconds of marginal stop motion animation but oh how you will long for that margin when for the rest of the movie the animation is replaced by production assistants waving around an inner tube with teeth no time for terror when this movie is hijacked halfway through by these comic relief boat rental doofuses who suddenly become the lead characters but again you gotta admit watching them try to be funny is better than plodding around after the sheriff only at the end one of them gets eaten and the other one is left sitting on a rock crying tears of loneliness that's no fun
originally i rented this film for my daughter since she is keen on soccer and i was not disappointed that way except the plot interfered with the soccer scenes as a dad i suppose i was a little surprised at the introduction of the topic of lesbianism but i have to admit that as a parent these issues are completely available to children nowadays as uncomfortable as i feel with the topic in a way this emotion was a segue right into the main premise of the film that at some age you must trust your children to make their own choices this dilemma is introduced by a young british born teen girl jasminder jess of east indian heritage who dreams of playing professional soccer the pending marriage of her older sister in a traditional hindu marriage provides many rich opportunities for her to explore in a nice way her hopes and fears for her future br br the multi cultural challenge was a very interesting technique to explore jess's frustration with her parents expectations for her again no different in substance than most child parent relationships br br in summary the soccer scenes are great lots to learn in slowmo and while i didn't need the storyline something was needed to keep the movie going
this movie was made for tv so taking that into account i'm not going to rip into it as hard as i would a feature film the script is sub par but it does succeed in being mildly humorous in spots whether it means to be or not the acting is mostly over the top but that is true for many lower budget movies br br the aspect of this movie that i really hated though was that 90 95 of it is shot on film but in random places there will be 5 10 seconds where the footage is shot on video you can tell because there is less contrast the colors are less vivid and the footage is clearly 30 frames per second instead of film's 24 frames per second i'm not sure if maybe these scenes had to be shot later and at that time they didn't have the money to shoot on film i assume this is why anyway but it is disorienting and really makes the film look shoddier than it had to look br br anyway i've definitely seen worse movies but i definitely wouldn't say that i enjoyed this movie and i can't recommend that anyone see it
this documentary by marian cooper is absolutely amazing i saw it tonight on turner classic movie channel i think i will see if i can order a copy of it on dvd the film footage doesn't look all blurry and choppy like you might think from 1925 b w silent film set in iran in 1925 the nomadic tribe people in the documentary leave their desert home and cross a raging river men women children animals then up and over a snowy mountain pass all barefoot it is sink or swim and climb or die in search of grass for their animals they have cows goats dogs horses mules in one scene a man is carrying a mule who is too sick to climb the mountain the children in the documentary all look happy and healthy they had such a hard life i wonder if the nomadic tribes of iran still live like this makes you appreciate modern life in usa
loosely based on the james j corbett biography the roar of the crowd gentleman jim is a wonderfully breezy picture that perfectly encapsulates not only the rise of the pugilistic prancer that was corbett but also the wind of change as regards the sport of boxing circa the 1890s br br the story follows corbett a perfectly casted errol flynn from his humble beginnings as a bank teller in san fransico thru to a chance fight with an ex boxing champion that eventually leads to him fighting the fearsome heavyweight champion of the world john l sullivan beefcake personified delightfully by ward bond not all the fights are in the ring tho and it's all the spin off vignettes in corbett's life that makes this a grand entertaining picture there are class issues to overcome here perfectly played out as fellow club members pay to have him knocked down a peg or two and corbett has to not only fight to get respect from his so called peers but he must also overcome his ego as it grows as briskly as his reputation does along with the quite wonderful corbett family and all their stoic humorous support corbett's journey is as enthralling as it is joyous yet as brash and as bold as he is he is a very likable character and it's a character that befits the tagged moniker he got of gentleman jim br br the film never sags for one moment and it's a testament to director raoul walsh that although we are eagerly awaiting the final fight the outer ring goings on are keeping us firmly entertained not even the love interest sub plot hurts this picture thank you alexis smith the fight sequences stand up really well and they perfectly show just how corbett became the champ he was his brand of dancing rings round slugger fighters is now firmly placed in boxing history as the final reel rolls we all come down to earth as an after fight meeting between sullivan and corbett puts all the brutality into context and it's here where humility and humbleness becomes the outright winner and as far as this viewer goes it will do for me to be sure to be sure 9 10 for a truly wonderful picture
simply great movie no doubt about it great story and superb performances be it amitabh akshay shefali priyanka boman or rajpal hindi film industry is going shameless with mallika and co this movie is totally vulgarity free and therefore bound to fail in vulgarity addicted our indian society but the message and concept this movie carries are absolutely superb anu malik boring copy cat could have been avoided and ismail darbar or himmesh reshmmiya could have been used as musician i think vipul shah should have given little bit gujarati touch particularly in music also anu malik is worst musician around and he thinks himself popstar but this is not the movie where is presence was required he looks only good with govinda style songs i felt some nice serious music with couple of good ghazals or sad songs could have made this movie more memorable
this enjoyable minor noir boasts a top cast and many memorable scenes the big distraction is the complete disregard for authentic accents the spanish characters in the film are played by a frenchman boyer a belgian francen a greek paxinou and a hungarian lorre and to top it all off bacall is supposed to be an english aristocrat despite these absurdities the performances are all very good especially those of paxinou and lorre but the scene in which boyer paxinou and lorre meet and talk in wildly different accents is a real hoot and i guess seeing as how they were alone that they should actually have been speaking in spanish anyway it seems pretty weird that the brothers warner couldn't find any spanish speaking actors in los angeles of course hollywood has often had an any old accent will do policy my other favorite is greta garbo swedish as mata hari dutch who falls in love with a russian soldier played by a mexican ramon novarro maybe they should have got novarro for confidential agent he would have been great in boyer's role or at least in francen's which would have saved greatly on the dark make up budget
its a gem movie if anyone who hasn't seen movie sholey he cant understand what is going on there a thakur call men for catching a big terrorist who is like god and even police don't know abut him but these ppl do br br biggest advantage of film is its speed u never know what is going on and the part is completed actors are at there best of worst acting and actress is here for time pass of songs and what u cant forget is the cool dialouge which seems to come in very long time but u cant understand them so easily try hard for that and last word i haven't seen movie complete due to a brain roast so plz tell me ditz end if it have
this movie shows us once again how genius the japanese directors are and were this movie could be seen as a sort of a silent movie tetsuo well eisenstein
br br ok well i rented this movie while i was bed ridden hopped up on pain killers and let me say it didn't help the film any br br the film is about a man who buys a car as he is going through a midlife crisis he loves the car more than anything around him one day his wife decides to borrow the car since i don't want to spoil not that there was anything to spoil i shall let your imagination figure out the zany and i use that word lightly antics that follow br br i had to fight to stay awake through this snore a minute sleeper of a film and i would like to say that if you are venturing to the movie store and are thinking about being adventurous please don't it's a waste of the film it was printed on br br then again i could be wrong
this sequel is thoroughly uneven incoherent and rambling in plot if there really is one and tries too damned hard to be modern ridiculous out of period and character 21 st century style songs predominate and cute yawn there are too many manufactured belaboured jokes with animals the actors in his film are secondary to the juvenile plot even glenn close and she is normally very good sweeps through this film parodying herself as the original de ville and the lead from sunset boulevard it's a film that isn't even good to look at this is a very good example of a bad and pointless sequel even basic instinct 2 had a plot characterisation and acceptable acting this doesn't it is bad
this film is amazing and i would recommend to child and adult alike the animation is beautiful the characters are rich and interesting and the story is captivating far better than anything the american studios were producing at the time however there is a couple of caveats to this statement it's a shame that disney bought the studio ghibli back catalogue and then proceeded to butcher it my main point being disney re dubbed the film despite the original english version being very impressive the new cast with van der beek et al ruined it and took away much of the attractiveness of the characters e g pazu and sheeta went from adventurous companions to whiny teenagers the original music score is also far better than the disney remix it begs the question why did disney make such changes it seems to me is that by having van der beek et al being cast then disney can draw in more money which is fair enough but in the process they tainted they film it is still a beautiful film and i would still recommend it to anyone my main beef is that disney ruined a film from childhood which i loved and still love i am lucky enough to have an original japanese import with the original english dub which i am now going to guard with my life
if this movie proves only one thing it's that keaton is was and always will be a comic at heart even when dodging bullets heading for the electric chair and getting at the wrong end of an information line in prison br br but johnny dangerously goes on to prove even more in the '80s the zaz boys zucker abrahams zucker were the pinnacle in the world of genre spoofs but there were several pretenders to the throne this time amy fast times at ridgement high heckerling tries her hand with an amazing amount of television writers behind the script go and check br br this slap happy slapstick spoof of the 1930's cops and gag sters movies throws just about every cliche for a loop and even adds a few cliches that didn't exist way back when br br and not only is the ever dependable keaton on hand as the johnny of the title but so are such funny guys and dolls as piscopo henner stapleton boyle dunne devito walston and just about every other actor in hollywood that happened to walk into the immediate vicinity you'd be surprised by how many faces you'll recognize i know i was br br and the jokes well when they start out they come at you fast and furious like a machine gun there are too many to count in the beginning topped off with a crazy theme song by weird al yankovic but you have to watch for when they reload and they have to reload a little too often br br everyone tries they seem to be having fun and i was laughing a good amount of the time in the end though there was plenty of time to think about how certain scenes could have been funnier not usually the best thing to think about after watching a comedy br br but for a slow night when there's nothing good on tv pop in johnny and be ready for some dangerously serious laughter br br eight stars check out johnny dangerously don't be a bastidge
there is indeed much to complain about this movie version of molnar's mystical play farrell looks good in his title role but his line readings frankly stink this also suffers in large part from this being credited as the first movie that makes use of rear projection the sets look phony br br there are two great strengths in this show however although the dialogue readings limp the visual performances are perfect rose hobart as julie is little remembered today mostly for rose hobart in which joseph cornell cut down the programmer east of borneo to simply shots of her credit melford's stylish visual direction of the original her great beauty and simple although stagy performance help repair some of the damage to the earth bound sections of this movie br br however one of borzage's themes is the mystical power of love and it is the handling of the celestial sections that make this great from the arrival of the celestial train to the journey to 'the hot place' h b warner's performance here is as always perfect br br so we have here a flawed but very interesting version i think that lang's 1934 version is better as well as the celestial scenes in the henry king version of carousel the watered down musical remake but i still greatly enjoyed this version and think you should give it a chance
this movie is maybe one of the most boring movies of 2000 that i have seen especially the music fails to create suspense when people suddenly disappear also aspects such as martial law are not treated with the necessary seriousness the story itself has problems the un could never take power over the world since the united states alone would not allow it but nations such as china russia japan etc would not either this would also play against someone trying to take over the world as nicolae carpathia does this reminds me of james bond movies only that those have more action naturally the movie is made for christians and only for christians and they may enjoy it since i cannot count myself a christian i find the whole idea ludicrous this prophecy furthermore seems to be if believed to be true dangerously close to other prophecies by cults for the end of the world why fear such a possibility when we can make life as good as possible here on earth without
four prisoners share a single cell the domineering transvestite marcus clovis cornillac marcus's idiot savant buddy paquerette dimitri rataud who will eat anything in sight including pocket watches cockroaches and his little sister lassalle philippe laudenbach the intelligent librarian who murdered his wife and carrère gérald laroche the new guy who was caught up in corporate fraud and is now focused on escaping after a brick falls from the wall of the cell the men discover the hidden journal written by a 'fountain of youth' obsessed serial killer who occupied the cell in the 1920s is this journal the secret to their escape or is there something much more sinister behind it br br i was a little weary about getting into this film because the only other experience i have with eric valette was the dreadful one missed call 2008 which i consider to be the worst theatrically released film i've ever seen however much of what was wrong with one missed call could probably be attributed to klavan's awful script because as i remember valette's direction wasn't the worst part about the film unless he chose to include the baby anyway maléfique was a good way to get my respect back it's a french film obviously something i like and it takes place in prison which is my second favourite horror setting after asylums so that's two points for him before the film even starts luckily valette had me once the film ended as well maléfique is a rather deep rather complex rather compelling story of obsession and desperation the desire and need to bring fantasies to reality while it's not a terrifying film in the traditional sense the oddity of its power makes it pretty damn frightening the period between the climax and conclusion was some of the best film i've seen in quite some time and i would wholeheartedly recommend this to anyone who is looking for a decent psychological thriller with some pretty cool gore br br final verdict 8 5 10 quite a bit of respect earned back by valette br br note paramount picked up the rights to make an american remake surprise surprise it's due out in 2009 i'm not sure why to be honest as this doesn't seem like something that would be a big moneymaker here in the states but i've been surprised before br br vive la france br br ap3
this has got to be one of the worst fillums i've ever seen and i've seen a few it is slow boring amateurish not even consistent within its own simplistic reading of the plot the actors do not act i can't blame them they have been given a script of such utter banality all they can do is trudge through it with a pain behind their eyes which has nothing to do with the evil goings on in summersisle br br there is not one moment in this film that rings true not an honest line nor a single instant where one is moved the nicholas cage character is so badly drawn that one feels not a smidgeon of compassion for him through all his tribulations i have no doubt that i was seeing a suffering man up there but it was nicholas cage fully aware of the fact that he was in the worst movie of his entire career
having seen triumph of the will i can only say this movie is ghastly even measured against the historically low standards of the time naturally it's all totally fabricated and prejudicial this is what one would expect of 1930's german propaganda unfortunately the quality of the presentation itself is hackneyed and cheap it's also so blatantly ridiculous that even contemporary germans must've left the theater holding their noses in a genre renowned for its base appeal lack of originality and unapologetic wrong headedness this film doesn't even qualify as bad it would have to improve significantly to attain that status
contrary to some people's summaries the women depicted in the film are not geisha they are oiran prostitutes living outside the most famous pleasure districts and their lives and experiences represent the lives of a great number of tokugawa era women i can't say the stories were particularly enlightening but their charm lies in just how typical they are the themes are universal and everyday love friendship and sacrifice br br i did greatly enjoy the art direction and the acting i felt like i was getting a glimpse of a time and place i can never otherwise glimpse the actors especially the 4 women who played the main oiran were a thrill to watch i'd only recommend this movie to people who want a taste of japanese culture or to those who enjoy quiet and emotional stories it's a great example of both
only reason i have seen 101 dalmatians was its nominations for original song and costume design for the oscars i must admit that i was less than impressed with this film in this sequel cruella devil by the way glen close pulls off this role very well is released from the hospital due to her good behaviour she likes all sort of animals and locks all her furs away from that point we only wait until she starts having crises soon enough she does and tries to make the best coat of fashion world of course for herself and from fine dalmatian fur apart from glen close i found all cast quite silly but from a child's eye funny that is fair enough as its target market is i assume children under 12 quite a good entertainment for children and families but didn't do much for me out of
there are no spoilers in this review there's nothing to spoil br br no plot nothing most clip shows at least try to tie the clips into the plot by some tenuous stretch but this didn't even do that clips three lines to lead into the next interminable sequence of dull clips ok so perhaps they were short on production time but they'd have been better off skipping this episode entirely what a waste of time br br i'm not sure how this got made in fact scrubs is usually much better at subverting tropes but somehow this got through br br thank heavens they were back on form by the next episode
the only value in this movie is basically to laugh at how bad it really is with a plot that makes your average middle school writer look good and acting which is almost as good it gets my bottom score one of tom hanks very early films where he obviously didn't have the pleasure to be real picky the best special effect of the movie consists of a guy dressed up in an incredibly fake rubber monster consume
has there ever been a movie more charming than this one of the reasons everything works so well is that the group of actors really seem to interact and have an effect on each other's lives the center of it is the romance of james stewart and margaret sullavan who work together and can't get along face to face but who completely connect with each other anonymously as pen pals but there are also supporting characters and unlike a lot of romantic comedies including you've got mail the recent update of shop they're not just whipped up to support the two leads and their needs everyone gets to be an intricate part of ernst lubitsch's rich tapestry of charm one of the most heartwarming scenes in movie history takes place when the near tragic frank morgan casually and humbly searches for someone to have christmas dinner with a must see out of
the national gallery of art showed the long thought lost original uncut version of this film on july 10 2005 it restores vital scenes cut by censors upon its release the character of the cobbler a moral goody goody individual in the original censored release of 1933 is here presented as a follower of the philosopher nietsze and urges her to use men to claw her way to the top also the corny ending of the original which i assume is in current vhs versions is eliminated and the ending is restored to its original form a wonderful film of seduction and power hopefully there will a reissue of this film on dvd for all to appreciate its great qualities look for it
i just don't see how a concorde new horizons film directed by jim wynorski and featuring the acting talents of andrew stevens and a puppet could be bad it just boggles the mind doesn't it br br well let's make no mistake about it munchie strikes back is indeed a bad film munchie is a puppet who has been around for many centuries for reasons not fully explained until the end of the film he is sent to earth to help a single mother and her son the mom's problem her main problem at least is that she has a balloon payment due on her mortgage in two weeks to the not so tiny tune of 20 000 ouch she can't come up with the money because she just got fired ok just is the key word in that sentence what the was she planning on paying it off with a single paycheck maybe it would've been a good idea to have spent the last several years saving up for it ya think br br munchie has magical powers similar to those a genie would possess but there isn't a limit on the number of wishes you can make munchie gets the boy a bunch of fancy stuff for one night but then the kid asks for it to be sent back to the mall munchie was borrowing it from the annoying furball also uses his otherworldly skills to help the boy win a baseball game by means of cheating a baseball is hit so hard that it orbits the earth several times sadly those dumb parents watching the game don't think it's at all strange hmm br br anyway i'd like to wrap this up because this has already drained away enough of my lifeforce as it is you'll be truly moved by the scene where leslie anne down playing the mother kicks a dog which is yapping at her your heart will melt at her charm when she notices dollar bills fluttering down on her front yard and she wonders how it could be snowing during the summer munchie strikes back 's credits promised another film to follow entitled i believe munchie hangs ten to date the movie viewing public has been robbed of what would surely have been a cinematic tour de force heh 1 10
this is the worst movie i have ever seen i was going to get up and leave at tape 4 but i stuck it out i now consider myself a masochist afghanistan come on guys who's the idiot who forgot to hide the sanskrit billboards i thought the lead actor george calil was particularly inept apart from the bad acting and over zealous camera shake i thought using the events of 9 11 as a reason to make larson the lunatic implodes all over a screen near you disgraceful and irreverent to the victims of 9 11 using a phone call from larson's wife sarah supposedly from one of the terrorist held planes on that day was appalling the camera shake didn't make me feel sick that cold hearted stunt did
i gave this movie a 5 out of pure pity my intention is not to burst anyone's bubble because i've seen as i've skimmed through other comments that this movie is quite appreciated by many well it is not worth any praises and i say this because i've seen the original anime basilisk and this movie shames it deeply perhaps if you see shinobi alone you could like it it is enjoyable due to the well choreographed battles based on fantasy more than on martial arts and i agree that their beauty is deeply enhanced but the story is nothing like the original one now i understand that when one transforms an anime manga into a movie one must make certain changes i was not expecting to see the freakish characters from the anime although they have a well established role and some are truly profound and well designed but i certainly did not expect to see immense and wrongly placed changes that basically ruin the entire story characters who are dramatically and unethically mutilated transformed in something the public might love more perhaps for instance oboro who in the anime is a sweet innocent girl completely and utterly in love with gennosuke becomes a vengeful clan leader in the movie i liked the fact that the woman becomes strong and evades the limitations imposed on her by the era we are talking about japan 17th century but her mood changes are unbelievable and badly written hotarubi which is one of my favourite characters in the film but who is not known for her childish and sensitive nature becomes a pathetic little girl who is not only not madly in love like in the anime but is more or less worthless in the plot i could go on and on like how they made tenzen the worst and most dangerous character in the anime exceptionally weak and unattractive or how gennosuke the leading character seems completely misplaced and confused not to mention again weak the music is beautiful and the image is astounding which was expected of a japanese movie and i appreciate it for that but do not watch this if you've seen and enjoyed basilisk because it is just hopeless basilisk although based on fantasy with elements of horror and largely exaggerated is splendid and has so much more depth in its characters storyline historical value and it is may i say heartbreaking shinobi was a waste of time and i could not believe it kept on going after what was supposed to be the climax alas it pains me deeply to judge a movie so harshly but i advise you against it please watch the anime or at least watch the movie first and then repair your image of what basilisk really is by watching the anime otherwise you will have a seizure when you realize how they've massacred it
lord alan cunningham antonio de teffè is a nutjob seen early on trying to escape an insane asylum with this castle slowly succumbing to ruin likes to kill various hookers who resemble his deceased wife evelyn a woman who betrayed him for another man with those red locks this nutcase is quite wealthy and his bachelor status can be quite alluring he however is overrun by his obsession with his late wife's memory specifically her adultery he saw her naked with the lover while the memory of evelyn is almost devouring his whole existence alan tries his best to find true love and believes he has with gladys marina malfatti who spends most of the film naked that's probably her lone attribute since she isn't a very good actress who agrees to marry him after a very short courtship which should probably throw up flags right away there's a key moment of dialogue where she knows exactly to the very amount what he is worth br br the only real person alan can confide in is his doctor from the hospital dr richard timberlane giacomo rossi stuart there are other key characters in this film that revolve around alan alan's cousin george rod murdock seems to be quite a good friend who often supplies him victims i mean dates while holding onto hope of getting his lord's estate some day albert roberto maldera evelyn's brother is a witness to alan's slaughter and instead of turning him into the police squeezes him for cash aunt agatha joan c davis wheelchair bound lives at the castle estate and is often seen snooping around behind cracked doors we later find that she is having a love affair with albert br br all that is described above services the rest of the story which shows what appears to be the ghost of evelyn haunting alan someone is killing off members of the cast family that revolve around alan and the body of evelyn is indeed missing br br the ultimate question is who is committing the crimes after alan and gladys are married where is evelyn's body and will alan go over the edge i have to be honest and say i just didn't really care much for this film it's badly uneven and the pacing is all over the place it looks great on the new dvd and the rising from the grave sequence is cool but what really hurts the film in my mind is that the entire cast is unlikable you really have a hard time caring for alan because he is a psychotic who is skating on thin ice in regards to holding his sanity he can be quite volatile who commits the crime really isn't that great a surprise for after several key characters are murdered off there aren't but a choice few who could be doing it what happens to alan doesn't really make your throat gulp because you can make the argument he's just getting what he deserves those behind the whole scheme of the film in regards to alan as i pointed out before aren't that shocking because if you are just slightly aware of certain circumstances or advantages they'd have that would benefit them with the collapse of alan's sanity then everything just comes off less than stellar i thought the editing was choppy and unexciting but the acting from the entire cast is really below par some stylistics help and there is a sniff of gothic atmosphere in the graveyard sequences to help it some
there are two points i need to make clear right at the beginning first of all we all know what this year's oscar's were really all about this year it was the academy's way of showing people that they are no racist and never have been they wanted to clear all preconceived notions about themselves secondly it's kinda pointless to make remarks about the show because really what difference will it make but it's fun to write about it this is the year i became fed up with the oscar's i will never watch the show again every year they do something wrong before crowe wins for gladaitor when they real winner should of been ralph fiennes for sunshine if you haven't seen this movie yet watch it and you'll agree eyes wide shut when released receieved no nominations and as far as this year goes well the bad choices were all over the place baz lurhmann gets no best director nomination are you joking a beautiful mind is up for best make up training day gets nominated the movie was awful and it seemed like washington didn't even turn in a performance all he proved was he knows how to use four letter words that's what h won the award for take away the language and i bet he was almost playing himself i liked gosford park i really did but why 7 nominations and how on earth could they not give it too altman i mean c'mon if there just giving the award to people to clear up any bad feelings what about altman the man has been in the public's eye for 32 years now and no oscar there were many many things that bothered me about this year's oscar's but i'll live with it as long as i never have to watch another show again the highpoint and the only one of the show was when woody allen made his first appearance ever to the award show that will go down as one of the greatest moments in he history of the show
alright i have to admit that i have never seen rhoda and only one or two episodes of the mary tyler moore show even though i don't know anything about this duo of comedic talent i still liked this movie a lot br br mary goes back to work rose tries her luck at being a comedian rhoda struggles with a photography career and meredith what exactly does she do again these three stories that we follow over two hours are amusing and entertaining in their own way when the two long time friends reunite it only makes the film better br br i was surprised about how good the writing was the little jokes thrown in by mary and rhoda were funny the script itself was very well put together br br i had seen moore and harper in other movies over the past few years and thought that they were very good but i had no idea that they worked this well as a team while both actresses do their share to fulfill the title of this movie they never seem to let me down during the run of this movie joie lenz and marisa ryan play their roles okay but nothing great the rest of the cast like jonah cecile and everybody else also works well together br br being that this is a reunion you would expect for a fan of either show to enjoy this from a non fan i still enjoyed this little get together good story lines for each character and the two main characters is what makes this film very good the newer version of the mtm theme song doesn't hurt either
a guy thing may not be a classic but it sure is a good funny comedy the plot focuses on paul jason lee who wakes up the morning after his bachelor party with no memory and becky julia stiles lying naked in his bed before he can figure out what happened he rushes becky out of his apartment because his fiance karen selma blair is coming after that as you could imagine chaos ensues br br almost every single scene in a guy thing delivers loud laughs the funniest moments come from when paul imagines what could happen if he tells karen selma blair is a truly talented comedian and the worst thing about this film is that she goes underused although she turns out to be more funny than stiles' character who actually isn't that interesting of course not every comedy is perfect br br as i said a guy thing is no classic but it's not bad either 7 10
okay if you have a couple hours to waste or if you just really hate your life i would say watch this movie if anything it's good for a few laughs not only do you have obese topless natives but also special effects so bad they are probably outlawed in most states seriuosly the rating of 'pg' is pretty humorous too once you see the native porn extravaganza i wouldn't give this movie to my retarded nephew you couldn't even show this to iraqi prisoners without violating the geneva convention the plot is sketchy and cliché and dumb and stupid the acting is horrible and the ending is so painful to watch i actually began pouring salt into my eye just to take my mind off of the idiocy filling my tv screen
i have to start by telling you how i came across this movie it was winter time in alaska around the year 1990 a friend of mine from australia was staying with me and my girl friend in a shoe box of an apartment winters in alaska can be a bit brutal and most people stay indoors drink heavily and watch anything that comes on the television i had found this movie outside of a thrift store laying in a snowbank and right away new it was a treasure it is quite possibly the best worst movie ever we spent the next two weeks watching this movie and drinking like fish we watched it so many times in fact that we would sometimes turn the television on its side or upside down for a more full filling effect it is a true gem the laughs will come nonstop and the memories last forever if you see this movie for rent in a video store steal it you won't regret it
kurt russell is elvis plain and simple his dedication to this role resulted in what i think is the best movie bio ever if you're an elvis fan see it if you can br br the made for television film was made two years after elvis' death br br one piece of advice there are two versions one at 180 minutes and one at 117 minutes the only one to watch is the longer one the shorter one has more than one hour of footage edited out it just does not work because the scenes in it are often dependent on the scenes that were cut br br this masterpiece takes you from elvis childhood through his emergence as entertainment's greatest star shelley winters and bing russell kurt's real dad are excellent as elvis' parents and pat hingle delivers a very competent col tom parker br br long live the king

house of evil aka dance of death of 1968 is the first of four infamous and odd last movies starring the great boris karloff and directed by jack hill and juan ibánez unlike snake people 1971 the incredible invasion also 1971 and the fear chamber 1972 which were all released after karloff's death in 1969 house of evil was released in 1968 when karloff was still alive house of evil is regarded by many as the worst of these four movies which are without doubt all rather crappy but definitely have their entertainment value as the unintentional comedies they are i personally prefer the fear chamber and house of evil over the other two simply for the reason that the lack of the slightest logic is even more extreme and since there is no suspense whatsoever in any of the movies the lack of logic increases the unintentional fun factor br br the odd story i don't know if i can really call it a 'plot' is set somewhere in europe in the 19th century after some girls are murdered and found with their eyes ripped out mathias morteval karloff an enthusiastic organ player invites his few remaining relatives to his bizarre mansion which is full of eerie toys his kinfolk includes lucy durant julissa who is engaged to one of the police inspectors investigating the murders br br i won't give away more of the story but i can assure you that it is quite bizarre throughout the movie there are some very funny moments especially some things karloff's character says boris karloff was without any doubt one of the most brilliant and important icons of the horror genre who ever lived and he manages to award this odd movie with a tiny bit of his greatness and although or because his role is due to a poor script and and directing in no way scary it looks like he deliberately plays it with a sense of humor just like in the movie's successors snake people and the fear chamber the female lead is once again played by julissa br br most of he supporting performances are hilariously amateurish the cinematography is terrible and the locations and sceneries are beneath contempt the storyline lacks the least bit of logic and the dialogue often does not make the slightest sense it is the poor story and dialogue however that makes this movie so entertaining to watch house of evil may be an extremely crappy attempt of a movie but it is certainly as unintentionally funny as it is bad fans of ed wood's movies should be very amused i personally found it hilarious crappy but entertaining nevertheless and definitely worth watching since there's boris karloff in it and due to the fun factor 3 10
after i watched this movie i came to imdb and read some of the reviews which compared it to lost in translation lite when i read that i immediately could see the reviewers point br br this movie was a poor attempt at a similar theme interestingly the format of the movie is nearly identical but the pacing is incredibly different 10 items rushes the viewer through the 1 day time line of the movie whereas the better planned lost in seems to stretch out over a few long days br br i'm sure some people will see this because it has morgan freeman and will be disappointed it seems his better roles now a days are supporting roles in big blockbusters rather than leading roles in sub 10mil limited release movies and indie films
here is proof of why mary pickford was america's sweetheart ' in this rather complex drama mary plays the young daughter of a squatter that dare to dream of a relationship with the son of one of the hill toppers ' the scenes where they steal a kiss and otherwise fall in love are simply delightful she is even willing to take a bath that mary could pull this role off at the age of 30 is simply amazing and somewhat due to her diminutive stature 5' br br tess must face numerous physical and emotional challenges she does so with spunk not seen in many heroines of the time tess packs a wallop and is not shy about fighting with anyone why she agrees to help the hill topper' daughter is beyond me but she sacrifices her own happiness in order to keep a deep secret pickford's close ups are wonderful br br danish born jean hersholt is simply wonderful as the villain the scene in which he manhandles a small baby is enough to make you throw vegetables or whatever at the movie screen if forrest robinson who plays daddy skinner had worn a beard he would have been a match for the model used in those world war i recruiting posters of uncle sam  wants you br br although the story is somewhat predictable and slow in the beginning it is worth the investment in your time to see the piece or pure americana ' the film highlights choices available to us all involving making someone else happy and what it is to be a real christian recommended
memoirs of a geisha is a visually stunning melodrama that seems more like a camp drag queen satire than anything to do with real people br br the first half of the film defensively keeps insisting that geishas are neither prostitutes nor concubines that they are the embodiment of traditional japanese beauty but other than one breathtaking dance the rest of the movie degenerates into pretty baby in storyville territory or at least vashti and esther in the purim story as all the women's efforts at art and artifice are about entertaining much much older drunken boorish men maybe it is japanese culture that is being prostituted and not just to the american louts after world war ii br br perhaps it's the strain of speaking in english but ziyi zhang shows barely little of the great flare she demonstrated in house of flying daggers shi mian mai fu and hero ying xiong michelle yeoh occasionally gets to project a glimmer of her assured performance in crouching tiger hidden dragon wo hu cang long only li gong shows any real life otherwise i kept picturing charles ludlam in various roles or even cillian murphy as in kabuki theater particularly as the plot dragged down in cat fight after cat fight br br the supposed love story has zero chemistry mostly due to the age differences and i mostly felt sorry for ken watanabe and hoped his hollywood pay check compensated for his loss of dignity as the mysterious chairman i remember more emotion in portrait of jennie as the young girl is anxious to grow up into jennifer jones to please joseph cotton br br we see brief glimpses of reality when the geishas pose with regular women as photographic attractions and as an ageless ziyi zhang lives out the war years in a very colorful kimono dying operation the finale has little sense of normality br br the score includes many chopped up traditional melodies with cello by yo yo ma and violin by yitzhack pearlman instead of traditional instrumentation that are beautiful to listen to in accompaniment to the lovely cinematography as long as one completely ignores the plot and stiff acting br br as my mind wandered i wondered how the great japanese directors of samurai movies would have dealt with this story which probably would have been more formal but a lot more emotional

i have just seen this movie and have not read the book the good thing of the movie is that at some parts it gets you thinking for a little while on the spiritual subject evolution sincronicity and your part in the world br br however the movie's immersion is easily broken and there is very little rapport between the viewer and the characters it is very clear that the book looses a lot in this movie version the events that were suppose to show sincronicity taking place are almost unrecognizable a lot of reasoning has to be done for the viewer to see that the scene indicates a coincidence and even more to imagine that it has something to do with a greater purpose br br enlightenment scenes are visually poor and do not create the better feeling that it was supposed to do you recall the enlightenment with keanu reeves in little buddha well this is nothing like that br br most scenes are poorly executed there are a lot of scenes that really don't develop the story and also do not help in creating an atmosphere br br the better actors in this movie namely hector elizondo joaquim de almeida and jürgen prochnow cannot save it the first 2 seem to have gotten more scenes than their characters should in an attempt to save the movie and because they were paid more but this does not work most of the scenes are not really necessary and do not help the story at all br br jürgen does good in his scenes and sells as an evil guy as always but the script does not help him at all the scene where he first tries to convince john matthew settle to join him is just bad script the execution of the scene when he dies in an explosion is absurdly bad executed the flashbacks throughout the movie cannot even be commented br br overall this movie is a big waist of time read the book i have not read it but it is probably a billion times better than this it has to be br br it is so bad that i had to write my first comment in imdb
the writer came up with a pretty decent idea for a story but many flaws in the execution of the plot took so much away from the film as to nearly render it unwatchable basic elements such as character development were glossed over at best inconsistencies also reared their ugly heads a massive mansion in the middle of the rural irish countryside characters just showing up in the gardens during a stormy night at very convenient times i might add all in all it wasn't bad i rated it a 4 based mostly on the story and talent of alison elliott
not even bob hope escorted by a raft of fine character actors can save this poorly written attempt at wartime comedy as his patented timing has little which which to work the plot involves a hollywood film star named don bolton hope and his attempt to evade military service at the beginning of world war ii followed by his enlistment by mistake in a confused attempt to court a colonel's daughter dorothy lamour bolton's agent played by lynne overman and his assistant portrayed by eddie bracken enlist with him and the three are involved in various escapades regarding training exercises filmed in the malibu california hills paramount budgeted handsomely for this effort employing some of its top specialists but direction by the usually reliable david butler was flaccid and this must be attributed to a missing comedic element in the scenario a shift toward the end of the film to create an opportunity for heroism by bolton is still born with poor stunt work and camera action in evidence oddly lynne overman is given the best lines and this veteran master of the sneer does very well by them dorothy lamour looks lovely and acts nicely as well and it is ever a delight to see and hear clarence kolb as her father whose voice is unique on screen or radio but there is little they can do to save this film cursed as it is with an error in script assignment
bad plot bad dialogue bad acting idiotic directing the annoying porn groove soundtrack that ran continually over the overacted script and a crappy copy of the vhs cannot be redeemed by consuming liquor trust me because i stuck this turkey out to the end it was so pathetically bad all over that i had to figure it was a fourth rate spoof of springtime for hitler br br the girl who played janis joplin was the only faint spark of interest and that was only because she could sing better than the original br br if you want to watch something similar but a thousand times better then watch beyond the valley of the dolls
it is an almost ideal romantic anime must see for all ages but the english dubbed version is not too good perhaps the 1999 version will be better
i almost made a fool of myself when i was going to start this review by saying this movie reminded me of billy elliot but then i looked up the resume of screenwriter lee hall only to find out that he was the guy who wrote billy elliot so it's mr hall who's making a fool of himself not me br br am i being a bit cruel on him no because lee has something most other aspiring screenwriters from britain don't have he has his foot in the door he has previously written a successful british movie that won awards and made money at the box office and what does he do next he gives the audience more of the same br br young jimmy spud lives on some kitchen sink estate he is bullied at school and no one loves him the only thing keeping him going is that he has aspirations to be a ballet dancer no actually he has aspirations to be an angel but considering his household he may as well be a ballet dancer he has a macho waster of a father who thinks ballet dancers are a bunch of poofs while his granddad says ballet dancers are as tough as any man you could meet i remember seeing the bolshoi ballet yup ballet is a main talking point on a run down british council estate those days not come to think of it neither is left wing politics which seems to be the sole preserve of middle class do gooders who live in nice big houses so right away everything about this set up feels ridiculously false br br another major criticism is that this is a film that has no clue who it's trying to appeal to i have often criticised channel 4 for broadcasting movies at totally inappropriate times the land that time forgot at 6 am for example but they showed this at 2 am and for once they've got it spot on considering the story involves politics ballet dancing gawd i hate it lung cancer and poverty there's no way this can be deemed suitable for a family audience but since the main protagonist is an 11 year old child and features angels and ballet dancers don't blame me if i seem obsessed with the subject there was no need to refer to them there's not much here for an intelligent adult audience either br br of course if lee hall had been told at the script development stage by the producers that he should write a story featuring a schoolboy and an angel and had flatly refused saying that he wanted to write about other themes and stories then i will apologise but throughout the movie you do get the feeling that once the film was completed it was going to be marketed to the exact same audience who enjoyed billy elliot
for persons of a certain age w w ii was the defining time of their lives and whatever followed could never compare as the movie opens a recently widowed but still lively woman judi dench hears a street musician gamely attempting to play the classic song stardust br br this recalls her memories of when she played in an almost all girl band that entertained between bomb raids during the war the drummer patrick ian holm happily avoided the draft and enjoyed the ladies br br patrick and dench's character meet and decide to reunite the band which takes them on a series of mini adventures despite ups and downs the band does reunite and makes a successful reappearance br br the movie is exquisitely written and understated with superb performances from all involved the characters are well developed and all people who have not quit living despite their years and there's all that glorious old swing music br br this isn't the pontification of steven spielberg but a serious movie nevertheless the war affected everyone and that lesson is not forgotten in a movie that isn't afraid to entertain as it teaches
having seen cube i've been a fan of vincenzo natali's work natali seems to have this inept ability to take a storyline and hardly wring it our like a wet towel for all the storyline he can muster instead he lets the stories themselves unfold in natural ways so much in fact that you may in fact believe there is this cube were people try to escape or in the case of nothing a large empty expanse where there is nothing the advert had me hooked instantly it seemed so simple take two characters who no one likes and send them to a world where there is nothing natali does this so simply that you forget the logic that a place where there is nothing cannot exist in fact the world of nothing becomes something of an irony within the film there's nothing there but also 'something' there br br it might be a good time to point out that the trailer is highly misleading i was fortunate enough to actually understand that the film leaned to a more comedic side than the trailer otherwise told so therefore upon watching the film i laughed every now and again whereas someone who the advert mislead may find themselves utterly confused br br if i may take a minute to give the film some praise where the film excels on is the concept it is a genius concept to have a world of nothing and to put two characters there not two brilliant minded characters who will philosophise and work out their surroundings but two idiots who have absolutely no clue as to where the hell they are another strong point is the film's cinematography though at first this may not seem it where each wall north earth south west up and down is just a white plane a perception of depth becomes faulty it is hard to determine where things are placed in the mis en scene the cinematography has many moments where this actually happens but for the most part the camera is placed so that two characters or an object and a character are placed in the foreground and background allowing a sense of depth to be realised br br however this film does lack in certain areas the film is relatively short but even so after a while the novelty of this world of nothing becomes rather dull and you wish to find some form of resolution within the plot we can also argue that the acting is once again questionable these two characters are in a sense unlikeable therefore we feel no sympathy at any point for these characters however on a flip side of that the chemistry and friendship between the two characters seems real enough but there is something lacking br br even so i do rank this as a thoroughly enjoyable film do not let the trailer fool you into thinking this is another science fiction horror film it is much more of a comedy than that it is indeed worth watching though purely for the concept itself
obviously made to show famous 1950s stripper misty ayers acting talents too bad she can't act br br boring little tale about sweet innocent sally down ayers being drugged and forced into white slavery prostitution then she meets likable tommy cole who instantly falls in love with her he wants to help her escape but can he you really won't care br br there's no real skin here ayers just strips down slowly to her underwear twice the rest is just a boring little tale chockful of bad acting atrocious comedy never thought prostitution was funny but what do i know and terrible post dubbed dialogue i admit there was a twist at the end i didn't see coming but that's not enough to sit through this also ayers' attempts at acting are hysterical a real bomb avoid
i saw this film at the toronto international film festival not as salacious as it sounds this is a three part documentary each episode is 50 minutes featuring slovenian superstar philosopher psychoanalyst slavoj zizek zizek takes us on a journey through many classic films exploring themes of sexuality fantasy morality and mortality it was directed by sophie fiennes of the multi talented fiennes clan she's sister to actors ralph and joseph br br i enjoyed this quite a bit although i think it will be even more enjoyable on dvd since there is such a stew of ideas to be digested freudian and lacanian analysis can be pretty heavy going and seeing the whole series all at once became a bit disorienting by the end of two and a half hours it didn't help that an ill advised coffee and possession of a bladder led me to some discomfort for the last hour or so br br my only real issue with this is that zizek picked films that were quite obviously filled with freudian themes he spends quite a bit of time on the films of hitchcock and david lynch not exactly masters of subtlety i would have liked to see him try to support his theories by using a wider range of films although that's really just me saying i'd like to see part four and five and six br br zizek is very funny and part of the humour was watching him present what amounted to a lecture while inserting himself into the actual scenes from some of the films he's discussing so for instance we see him in a motorboat on his way to bodega bay from hitchcock's the birds or sitting in the basement of the bates motel from psycho which is not to say that his theories are not provocative even when i found myself disagreeing with him it definitely made me think a little more deeply about the films which is exactly what he's trying to accomplish
now days most people don't watch classic movies such as this most of friends only watch movies from the '90s to present thats kinda stingy br br most old movies like this are masterpieces unique in their own way only because back when these movies were being thought of and made thats when ideas were fresh now people strain just to think of new ideas br br anyway to the movie for true fans of classic horror this is for you the movie is based with a investigator from scotland yard investigating the disappearance of an movie actor and stumbles on to three other strange occurrences with past residents of the same house br br i won't say anymore for i will ruin the movie more than i already have but it is a terrific movie for as old as it is and would never mind watching it again
and yet another run of south park comes to an end this wasn't as strong an episode as i'd hoped for but night of the living homeless was a stronger finisher then stanley's cup tsst bloody mary or erection day it still can't hold a candle to woodland critter christmas and goobacks but few episodes can br br night of the living homeless is a spoof of the zombie genre done in a way only south park would think of instead of flesh eating zombies the entities are homeless that request change and seem to survive off of it br br randy and other residents are locked in the community center though this time on the roof where they can survey the scene a particularly funny moment is when one member finds out his home is gone and becomes homeless leaving randy no choice but to shoot him br br meanwhile the four boys set out to solve the problem with the whole story behind the homeless takeover trying to convey a message but being seriously uninspired south park is at it's best a lot of the times when it is being ridiculous matt and trey played it safe this week and didn't really critique the homeless problem just lampooned it br br the shock moment of the episode comes when a scientist shoots himself in an attempt to avoid the homeless this is the first time a suicide on south park goes wrong and we watch the poor man miss his brain and then attempt to shoot himself many times while he painfully dies another inspired south park moment br br overall the episode was funny but it was kept from being great by withholding any real commentary on the homeless and sticking straight with the zombie shtick the ending is somewhat funny but nothing new br br now we must wait until october for the next batch of episodes it's a long haul but south park must be applauded for it's run the show seemed to be running out of steam last season but now it's back in full form
this movie has been poorly received and badly reviewed the book by rebecca west was written in 1918 soon after wwi when shell shock and trauma induced amnesia were not clichés as the reviewers call it many books and movies later it is difficult to go back in time and live as the characters lived the realities of the time the war and the horror of the experience of the first war to use lethal gas the british class system the wife thought all important the hopeless spinster and the lover from the past still seen with the eyes of love being as young and as beautiful as she was 20 years ago br br alan bates as the amnesiac soldier who will die if he isn't allowed to see margaret the girl of his youthful dreams builds on the devotion his character showed in far from the madding crowd having seen that performance it is possible to sense his strong romantic attachment to the girl who didn't live up to the family's and society's expectations margaret says we quarreled and as you rowed away you turned your face away from me so we know that the breakup was something that he instigated that it brought him shame but that he forgot the shame in his memory of his time with margaret i haven't seen all his films but in the ones i've seen he imparts a strong masculinity which shines through even in this role as the disabled soldier br br i didn't even recognize ann margaret at first and feel that her performance has been underrated not having read the book i wondered whether the child who died was the result of acting on a borderline incestuous feeling between jenny and chris though jenny does state that she is a cousin the way kitty keeps jenny in the nursery in the hair drying scene the fact that kitty says she always dries her hair in that room seems more a way for kitty to keep the coals of anger hot than the orientation of the room to the sun or sentiment about a lost child and the statement she made that she wished chris hadn't felt it necessary to preserve the room exactly as it was when the child was alive made her seem uncaring toward the memory of the child also jenny is shown as living in the house in a subservient role as high society would have done to a fallen member at the time br br having recently been the recipient of the intense fantasy of a lover non sexualin keeping with the mores of the time from 50 years ago i couldrelate to margaret's and her husband's dilemma i too was cast aside because i wasn't good enough for his family and upon his rediscovery of me via the internet i was burdened with helping him deal with his still very horrifying vietnam experiences and a marriage to a woman above his class whom he didn't believe he loved my husband like margaret's was very understanding but the strain was very real the lover was finally able to reconcile his real life situation with his fantasy of loving only me br br i thought that it was a good decision to show very little of the reliving of the war experience that was happening in chris's mind i thought of mrs dalloway with the wwi soldier who acts out very violent memories and commits suicide versus chris's joy in his fantasy of margaret in contrast the actiona of the soldier in mrs dalloway seems overwrought br br showing that the psychiatrist understood very little of what was happening to chris underlines what a major problem the whole group faced everyone seems to get their life back but was it the right choice
generally i like horror movies but unfortunately this fell out of the one pound bargain bin into my friends hand we sat down to watch it ready to be scared and ended up spraying food everywhere we were laughing so much the concept isn't that bad but why they decided number ten in the series would be lucky i don't know the worst thing about the movie is the actors the camera work was poor the special effects are actually not bad if i am being generous but overall the story failed to connect on any levels because the actors were as effective as a small lump of badly charred elm they were wooden beyond measure especially a foppish young actor who was fifteen years too young to be taken seriously as any kind of government agent he looked more like a public school boy in fact there was a really amusing sex scene where he looked like he was bobbing for apples as a busty lady rode on top of him and later his nappy sized underpants were hysterical but then i remembered it wasn't supposed to be a comedy i'm desperately wracking my brain to find something positive to say about this movie apart from the occasional flash of breasts but there simply isn't let's hope ten was the lucky number and they don't do another one i'm not sure my ribs could take it
hello playmates i recently watched this film for the first time ever and it is also my first experience of arthur askey i have to admit i was very impressed by this film as a fan of black and white films generally passport to pimlico the lavender hill mob and tommy trinder who is apparently a distant relative this film appealed in that it provided good old fashioned british humour i notice that there are some on here who have criticised askey's performance however in my opinion it stands the test of time as a fine example of forties comic acting and if anything adds to the picture by creating characters that are more than the mere stereotypes which seem to so dominate films now if you can get hold of this film i would recommend you get hold of it shame these films generally aren't shown on sunday afternoons anymore i am also glad to have had the opportunity to watch another piece of work by arnold ridley private godfrey in dad's army i thank you
an awful film it must have been up against some real stinkers to be nominated for the golden globe they've taken the story of the first famous female renaissance painter and mangled it beyond recognition my complaint is not that they've taken liberties with the facts if the story were good that would perfectly fine but it's simply bizarre by all accounts the true story of this artist would have made for a far better film so why did they come up with this dishwater dull script i suppose there weren't enough naked people in the factual version it's hurriedly capped off in the end with a summary of the artist's life we could have saved ourselves a couple of hours if they'd favored the rest of the film with same brevity
this little appreciated movie is one of my favorites i can watch it over and over dreyfus and braga are masterful but raul julia steals the show a tongue in cheek menacingly humorous gomez addams with just the right tone for this irreverent spoof of this oft told story br br generally untrumpeted and unappreciated moon over parador allows you to check out of reality and join the fun going on up on the screen two thumbs up
crude some times crass to me that's the summation of madhur bhandarkar's latest work page 3 he has no point of view just shallow funny digs at stereotypes what is the movie about is it about reporting a clan of people so called page 3 types who are so busy socializing and progressing their profiles in life that they have no time for anything else and you are either in it or out of it is it that there is no press at all to report everyday incidents madhur bhandarkar forgets that there is a main newspaper and page 3 is just a supplement perhaps an entertainer for checking out who's who and what's what don't mix the two and then there is power play that would happen in every walk of life so what have you told at the end of it all nothing just a few crude jokes strung together in an otherwise direction less movie
and that's how the greatest comedy of tv started it has been 12 years since the very first episode but it has continued with the same spirit till the very last season because that's where friends is based on quotes extraordinary situations are taking place among six friends who will never leave from our hearts let's say a big thanks to rachel ross monica joey chandler and phoebe in our first meet we see how rachel dumps a guy in the church how understand monica's search for the perfect guy there is no perfect guy why all you women are obsessed with that and how your marriage can be ruined when the partner of your life discovers that she's a lesbian till we meet joey phoebe and chandler in the next episodes enjoy friends
surprisingly not terrible and well animated for one of disney's straight to video throw away sequels like the previous sequel the lion king 2 i was glad that disney brought back most of the original voice actors which makes a big difference and they kept a good level of traditional animation the plot wanders around for a while but we are distracted by an unending string of jokes ranging from hilarious to dull to break up the detached plot and jokes they gave us some silly musical sequences which much like the jokes range from entertaining to a quick trip to the fridge for the most part the mst3k like moments are bland and full of untapped potential and really don't add a whole lot to the movie other than to act as a vehicle for an hour long flashback the new characters are at least likable and the old characters are out doing their thing so i can't fault them there overall this movie in not bad and it makes for a nice frivolous filler between the more serious lion king titles
the biggest national lampoon hit remains animal house and rightly so it was funny raucous and good natured br br the exact opposite of every other national lampoon film including class reunion br br please do not be fooled by the inclusion of stephen furst flounder from animal house or by the fact that john hughes wrote this jumbled mess this reunion is about as hilarious as root canal and twice as painful br br one star and that's being generous then again i always thought most of my old classmates were demons vampires and serial killers too
br br one would expect a movie with a famous comedian in the lead role to be a funny movie this is not the case here i laughed out loud once throughout the whole movie and that wasn't even during the final comedy scene which one would also expect to be the funniest this is one you can watch when it comes to tv don't spend any other money renting it
pleasant diverting and charming the best part is the swing numbers especially the rendition of my buddy partial though it may have been the acting was a bit over the top in areas but the mood set by wilder is so pleasant it is hard not to enjoy this film
this movie is supposed to be taking place in and around seattle the why is porteau cove p r o v i n c i a l park shown provincial parks are in canada and not the united states the inspector uses a palm pilot complete with stylus to 'read' that someone has hacked into the computer of the bridal shop i did not know that this was possible using a database storage device a woman appears in the movie without any introduction and is never introduced we learn half way into the movie that this woman works in the district attorney's office then in the correctional center a guard actually precedes jenks through a door and keeps his back to the offender this would never happen in a real correctional setting the director really messed on this one this doesn't happen in real life the acting is adequate the plot is good the cinematography is good however the many errors found in the continuity lead to a 3 out of 10 vote
studio 666 aka the possessed in the uk is another sub par slasher that has the appearance of a straight to dvd movie br br whilst many of the straight to dvd movies are fast paced or unintentionally hilarious in the so bad it's good sense studio 666 is a lamentable failure br br at the time of writing every comment on the first page includes a negative rating and a negative review every one of these people have hit the nail on the head br br the two people at the time of writing who wrote comments with a rating of 10 out of 10 should not be taken seriously obviously they've seen few slasher movies and have an even more limited understanding of horror br br the only really positive point i can make about this movie is that it does fare better than the choke and one of them two extremely mediocre slasher movies that i would not wish on my worst enemy br br the plot of this movie must have been done hundreds if not thousands of times the movie only has a slight twist and one that is badly handled to the usual expectations a depressed singer commits suicide soon after her spirit returns to possess one of her surviving friends the said possessed friend goes on a killing spree the rest of the plot really is too bizarre to sum up you'll just have to see it for yourself providing your interest has not yet waned to the point of extinction of course br br the acting in the movie is very poor for the most part the actress who played dora was an exception to this her character was always interesting and seductive when she was on the screen she helps to elevate the movie above similar contemporary efforts unfortunately some of the lines she was given to say were badly written to put it mildly and thus prevent her from saving the movie br br the direction was equally poor the villains did not seem the least bit menacing every killing was totally devoid of suspense or tension atmosphere was non existent and the camera work was incredibly basic some of the special effects if you can call them that reminded me of the tv series ghost stories unfortunately for the producers of this movie ghost stories had intelligently written scripts believable performances and made superb use of camera angles maybe if the producers had watched that tv series closely they'd have picked up some more techniques that might have saved this excuse for a movie br br the music is completely unsuited to the tone of the movie it's just rock music and not the best examples of this type either don't get me started on that awful song played at the beginning br br some aspects of the movie particularly dialogue are unintentionally funny unfortunately they are not funny enough to move the movie up or should it be down to the so bad it's good level br br overall studio 666 is a mundane mediocre slasher with very little noteworthy aspects i recommend this only to those who are fans of straight to dvd movies and have a desire to see every single slasher ever made
i am a great fan of martin amis on whose book this film is based unfortunately the director has been unable to translate the book to the screen the novel is thoroughly post modern and highly artificial in its wildly overblown characters and the disintegration of traditional plot line and character development it is an hilarious examination of human greed excess and emptiness by one of the most moral of contemporary british writers the director of the film has completely missed the point of the novel in his hands the film screams along at breakneck speed indulging in every known trick shot and 'odd' camera angle possible it is like ken russel on acid and suffers from that older director's self indulgence cranked up to a hundred not even the brief glimpse of gorgeous actor christian solimeno's penis was enough to save this wretched film for me abysmal
this movie is really goofy i saw it as an 11 year old and even then i thought it was pretty ridiculous i would only recommend this film to kids under the age of 12 i really didn't care for it but i do think that it answers some very good questions that kids need to be aware of such as 1 does money buy happiness 2 should i lie to my parents about things i think they wouldn't approve of 3 does money buy friendships 4 is money everything 5 shouldn't i tell my parents when someone is trying to hurt me granted these are very unrealistic situations but i do think that if parents discussed these issues with their children maybe they should watch this video as well in order to show scare their kids that lies have the potential to get you hurt
me and my girlfriend annette watched this together and we'll both comment br br both of us really enjoyed watching this even though it took some liberties with dicken's work a lot of dicken's works are somewhat dark and dreary including oliver twist but this movie changed all that it was fun colourful both visually and musically and the characters were more lighthearted br br travis normally i don't care a lot for musical and dance movies but the tunes in this production were catchy and lively and the choreography was awesome br br annette that's really saying a lot coming from travis i can't emphasise enough how really good the dance numbers were you can tell for example that those boys really worked hard getting the routines down to perfection br br travis three actors really stood out imo nancy shani w bill sykes oliver reed and artful dodger jack wild man that oliver reed can really do a good villain that one scene where you see his eyes thru the mail slot gave me chills down the back awesome and that kid jack wild was a perfect artful dodger and nancy was fantastic man i felt bad when she got killed she can sing too kudos to the casting department on their choices there i hated the oliver twist kid tho he was just too whiny and wimpy for my taste i kept wishing bill sikes would drop him off into the mud during the chase scene and they shouldn't have had him sing either br br annette acting was truly superb in addition to the three stars travis mentioned i felt ron moody fagin did a tremendous job he was so funny and at the same time lightly sinister too the supporting actors were great too harry secombe carried his mr bumble role extremely well and he has a wonderful singing voice i saw mr secombe perform in another movie entitled davy where he played an opera singer with pleasing results the talented harry secombe should have been in a lot more movies br br travis as i mentioned earlier the story isn't quite true to the book but imo it was more robust this movie was not boring either as some musicals seem to be and the continuity kept you moving right along with the characters the tunes did not detract from the plot or put you to sleep by being too long br br annette any musical movie which travis watches completely has to be a rare find and this one is indeed a rare find it is a very easy to watch production which carries the viewer smoothly and enjoyably through to the end in a day when movies all seem to be effects combined with pretty faces this was a refreshing interlude br br our combined rating for this was 8 5 of 10 we'll round up to 9 in this case br br travis i rated this a 7 mainly because the oliver twist kid mark l irritated me and his songs were torture to my overly sensitive ears otherwise it was an outstanding movie br br annette my rating is a 10 movies don't get much better than this and you can tell everyone involved in this production really worked hard to make it what it was a masterpiece br br please don't miss this one even if you normally don't like musicals it really is a rare treat
this movie is horrible everything in it has been done before there is nothing original i cannot stand when writers don't come up with their own plots br br a girl makes a wish on her 13th birthday and wakes up as an adult hmm sounds a lot like a movie in the 80s called big what is even more annoying is jennifer garner's acting she doesn't act like she is 13 she just acts like she is stupid br br from then on you can guess the whole plot she gets a good job and it just so happens that a friend she had at 13 works with her wow how awesome but no her friend is bad and turns on her trying to get her job but of course she wins in the end when she comes up with a great idea br br there's also a dancing scene in the movie that i've seen a thousand times before br br i hate this movie
this is it this is the one this is the worst movie ever made ever it beats everything i have never seen worse retire the trophy and give it to these people there's just no comparison br br even three days after watching this for some reason i still don't know why i cannot believe how insanely horrific this movie is was its so bad so far from anything that could be considered a movie a story or anything that should have ever been created and brought into our existence br br this made me question whether or not humans are truly put on this earth to do good it made me feel disgusted with ourselves and our progress as a species in this universe this type of movie sincerely hurts us as a society we should be ashamed i really cannot emphasize that our global responsibility as people living here and creating art is that we need to prevent the creation of these gross distortions of our reality for our own good it's an embarrassment i don't know how on earth any of these actors writers or the director of this film sleeps at night knowing that they had a role in making loaded i don't know what type of disgusting monsters enjoy watching these types of movies br br that being said i love a good bad movie i love shark attack 3 i love bad taste they are hilarious i tell all my friends to see them because they are bad br br but this this crosses the line of bad into a whole new dimension this is awkward bad this is the bad where you know everything that is going to happen every line every action every death every sequence before they happen and not just like a second or two before i mean like after watching the first 5 minutes before br br every cheesy editing effect is shamelessly used over and over again to a sickening point i really never want to see the shaky camera drug buzz rush effect or jump cuts or swerve cuts or any fancy cut ever again ever this is meticulously boring repetitive and just tortures the audience br br but and let me be specific here the most disturbing thing about this movie is that given the production it appears that a somewhat decent amount of money was actually put into this excrement i personally will grab the shoulders of the director if i ever see him and shake him into submission demanding that he run home and swallow two gallons of drain o or i will do it for him br br if we ever needed a new form of inhumane torture for our war prisoners abroad just keep showing them this movie in a padded cell over and over again trust me i think they will become more extravagant with suicide methods after the 72nd time of sitting through this br br stop these movies they are just the most vile of all facets of our society please stop now
i was gifted with this movie as it had such a great premise the friendship of three women bespoiled by one falling in love with a younger man br br intriguing br br not i hasten to add these women are all drawn in extreme caricature not very supportive of one another and conspiring and contriving to bring each other down br br anna chancellor and imelda staunton could do no wrong in my book prior to seeing this but here they are handed a dismal script and told to balance the action between slapstick and screwball which doesn't work too well when the women are all well known professionals in a very small town br br and for intelligent women they spend a whole pile of time bemoaning the lack of men sex lust in their lives i felt much more could have been made of it given a decent script and more tension the lesbian sub plot went nowhere and those smoking drinking women all 3 in their forties were very unrealistic even in the baby scene screw the baby gimme a cigarette right br br like i said a shame of a waste 4 out of 10
cute and playful but lame and cheap 'munchies' is another gremlins clone to come out from the 80s i'm not much of a fan of the imitations br br first it was the excellent 'gremlins' br br then came the very average 'critters' br br lets not forget the lousy 'ghoulies' br br but the complete pits would have to go to 'hobgoblins' br br is there more br br now 'munchies' for me would have to fall somewhere between 'ghoulies' and 'hobgoblins' actually i probably found it more entertaining than 'ghoulies' but i preferred thst one's darker tone br br from the get go it plays up its goofy nature which it's better for it but due to that nature the hammy acting alix elias and charlie phillips can get rather overbearing that you rather just see the munchies running amok that's where the fun occurs mostly light hearted fluff though as the story mainly centres on the munchies who are either hungry horny and destructive in a whole bunch of supposed comical encounters some moments do work in the small desert town as a couple of people are on the chase it's silly but strangely engaging thanks to the zippy pacing the creatures themselves look rather bland and poorly detailed as they're basic dolls being chucked about where their personalities arrived from is that they can actually speak and with attitude br br charlie stratton and a feisty nadine van der velde who was in 'critters' were fair leads harvey korman was acceptable in two roles robert picardo also pops up br br amusingly low cut entertainment for the undemanding
butch the peacemaker evidently after the violent beginning with spike tom and jerry all swinging away at each other butch calls a halt and wants to know why it's a good question br br cats can get along with dogs can't they he asks tom who nods his head in agreement mice can get along with cats right jerry nods no and then sees that isn't the right answer br br they go inside and butch draws up a peace treaty complete with professional artwork most of the rest and the bulk of the cartoon is the three of them being extremely nice to one another what a refreshing change of pace i found it fun to watch i can a million of these cartoons in which every beats each other over the head br br anyway you knew the peace wasn't going to last a big piece of steak spells the death of the peace treaty but en route it was nice change and still had some of usual tom jerry clever humor
let me say that i love adam sandler watching reign over me i was paying close attention to his acting br br when he raises his voice i cant help but think of happy gilmore yelling at a golf ball then i snap back as adam sandler sucks me in br br reign over me is a great film a film that comes off slow at first with you expecting emotion in every scene br br don cheadle always does a great job and is no exception here with some truly great lines and is worthy of an oscar in any movie he does br br adam sandler was amazing in so many ways not only was this his most dramatic best acted film of his career but i can recall laughing out loud at many parts of this film br br the supporting cast was great also with saffron burroughs and jada pinkett smith br br i would highly recommend this movie its got tremendous acting beautiful shots of nyc great comedy great drama and a new found respect for adam sandler if you ever doubted him or a reassurance at how great don cheadle is
i was absolutely blown away by john cassavetes's opening night it's the first movie of his that i've seen that seems to be on a bigger scale thus it feels more mainstream but it still doesn't feel as if he grounded himself any more than he has in his previous films that is perhaps what makes it so intense there is also something undoubtedly cathartic about watching this movie br br it's about what in fact cassavetes has made a staple of his career an ideal that he has expressed behind the camera throughout his career as a director and is here expressing it in front rowlands's character middle aged stage actress myrtle gordon cannot bring herself to play her role in the upcoming production as written so she uncalculatedly follows impulse after impulse resulting in what appears to be chaos on stage until she finds the right one it's a daringly abstract premise br br this is a movie that does not fail to capture the innate steering that one goes through during an emotional cleansing no one understands why myrtle does many of the things she does and it is seen and even portrayed as something destructive yet it just might be the best thing for her it may be a cleansing rather than a breakdown a withdrawal a cocoon a rebellion it all culminates into a meltdown cassavetes gives her character a brutally real touch which is that early on she is ardently arguing that she has nothing in common with her character yet she is in quiet but emotionally corroding fear that the opposite is true br br the last scene the climactic performance that myrtle shares with a character painfully estranged from her who is acting with her is one of the most interesting hilarious hard hitting enlightening and enjoyable moments i've ever seen in a movie
when this movie so well proves that they indeed are unnecessary br br although few lines it was kind of weird to see this movie no subs in a language unknown a friend of mine sent a vhs included a few pieces of papers with all lines translated to english with her translation next to me i began watching this tale it is indeed a tale and from the very first tunes of the whistling melody during opening credits i was stuck the colours that minimal acting well in most cases absurd comedy slapstick thoughtful beautiful along with a few other movies paris texas and nenette et boni this one is able to speak to anyone's heart without words whenever you get the chance see it whatever you do don't miss it it's a once in a lifetime experience oh acting is great the soundtrack is brilliant the story is simple and told a thousand times before but rarely never like this
now this is what i'm talking about finally a low budget horror outing that uses its limitations to its advantage wendigo while occasionally flawed is a triumph of the imagination granted it leans heavy on evil dead style camera moves for its moodiness but it's still a damn sight better than 99 of direct to video dross br br the story is pretty simple a family takes a vacation at a remote cabin and are menaced by one particularly unhinged hunter but director larry fessenden really knows how to build suspense and add layers of unsettling creepiness through the use of the mythical wendigo is it real is it all in the boy's imagination is it an externalization of the child's emotional state br br some have quibbled that the film is unsatisfying because it's left to you to decide don't be put off by such petty nonsense a film that makes you think is not one to avoid it's one to rejoice in
this is a horrid disaster of a film from beginning to end it's filled with bad acting and even worse direction and editing the only redeeming parts of the film are a few numbers by streisand because the kristofferson parts are impossible to watch or listen to the main problem of this film is that we never see kristofferson's character at his peak or streisand's character struggling the first should be seen in decline and the second rising the final streisand number could have been one of the greatest finales in film if it was directed and edited properly the single framed shot of her face for the duration of the song was a terrible mistake had the band audience and wide shots of the stage been shown this number could have been dynamic and interesting this film must have been directed and edited by an nyu film school dropout the only thing worse may be the wretched screenplay the final musical number is the only redeeming part of this film and even that is botched completely by misguided technical decisions
raising victor vargas is a movie you definitely need to see it was very heart felt and had a lot of humor that gets you sucked right in it is so much like real life with what teenagers have to go through victor a cocky teen but with a good heart at the end deals with love in all the right places dealing with girls and family at the end victor learns the true meaning of love after dealing with a old fashioned grandmother and a girl who he wants to use is actually using him too i recommend people to watch this movie because it will be like you are watching a real family thats how much feeling this movie has one heart felt moment was when victor's grandmother throws victor out over something simple victor was really heart and couldn't believe that she would do something like that it made me feel real sorry for him like it was real overall i give this movie a b
this unassuming fairly routine series deserves credit in the tv history books for two reasons it was the first to win an emmy award for best syndicated series and it was the very first show to come from the fabled studios of republic pictures known for its low budget but high powered shoot em ups in the 30's and 40's br br republic was one of the first hollywood studios to make a leap into the small screen which was still in its infancy but the studios' tenure as producer of tv pulp fiction would be brief after this show they would later dabble with the other format that they were known for the adventure serial with commando cody as well as other series but like this one they didn't last longer than 39 episodes also republic was in its last stages as a studio it would finish out its tenure in hollywood as rental stages for several revue studio series such as soldiers of fortune the original dragnet and kit carson before finally shutting its doors in 1959 br br anyway stories of the century wasn't that bad of an oater its calling card was tales based on authentic figures in western history mainly outlaws like black bart johnny ringo john wesley hardin the dalton bros and the like the late jim davis best known for his role as the ewing patriarch in dallas put in an amiable job in the lead role as matt clark a fictional railroad detective who has to contend with said outlaws played by veteran and soon to be veteran character actors br br two amazing facts here the incidents would take place in different time lines some in the 1880's some at the turn of the century but clark never ages and also matt has the good luck to saddle himself with two lovely female detectives as sidekicks frankie adams played by mary castle and her replacement margaret jonesy jones by kristine miller the lone ranger could only wish for lady companionship you can only spend such time with tonto for so long br br stories of the century is a studio city tv production from republic pictures corp 39 episodes were made during 1954 all 39 of which are in public domain and on dvd
anyone not aware of the 1973 original british lion movie ' the wicker man' would no doubt have left the cinema with the impression 'poor' and 'peurile' br br as a devotee of the original i left with the impression purely poor br br from the grim reality of haggle toothed inbreds drawing the force of law and order into a web of paganistic barbaric ritual on a remote scottish island named summerisle the original to a near amazon ic colony off the maine coast of the us named summersisle the remake hardly hits the spot br br this is quite sadly a case of what 'could' have been a classic remake of a classic being tampered with to cater for a simple minded public nothing more and nothing less br br gentlemen or given the reworked context of the film ladies involved hang your heads in shame
this is probably the fastest paced and most action packed of the german edgar wallace krimi series a cross between the dr mabuse films of yore and 60's pop thrillers like batman and the man from uncle it reintroduces the outrageous villain from an earlier film who dons a stylish monk's habit and breaks the necks of victims with the curl of a deadly whip set at a posh girls' school filled with lecherous middle aged professors and with the cops fondling their hot to trot secretaries at every opportunity it certainly is a throwback to those wonderfully politically incorrect times there's a definite link to a later wallace based film the excellent giallo whatever happened to solange which also concerns female students being corrupted by and corrupting their elders quite appropriate to the monk theme the master mind villain uses booby trapped bibles here to deal some of the death blows and also maintains a reptile replete dungeon to amuse his captive audiences br br alfred vohrer was always the most playful and visually flamboyant of the series directors and here the lurid colour cinematography is the real star of the show the monk appears in a raving scarlet cowl and robe tastefully setting off the lustrous white whip while appearing against purplish night backgrounds there's also a voyeur friendly turquoise swimming pool which looks great both as a glowing milieu for the nubile students and as a shadowy backdrop for one of the murder scenes the trademark kicker of hiding the ende card somewhere in the set of the last scene is also quite memorable here and there's a fine brassy and twangy score for retro music fans br br fans of the series will definitely miss the flippant eddie arent character in these later films instead the chief inspector sir john takes on the role of buffoon convinced that he has mastered criminal psychology after taking a few night courses unfortunately klaus kinski had also gone on to bigger and better things the krimis had lost some of their offbeat subversive charm by this point and now worked on a much more blatant pop culture level which will make this one quite accessible to uninitiated viewers
the first mistake you make in titling a film is to use of the living dead without really having a budget for real zombie fx sure this was a low budget zombie flick really low budget i thought it was a film school project amateur actors and amateur effects br br it was really not too bad considering the above and it presented an interesting twist to the zombie genre if you are going to get an r for violence you might as well give us some good shots of the babes being attacked the women were so little used in this film that it could almost be classified as gay interest br br and i am staying out of oakland there was a heck of a lot of shooting going on and no cops in sight
this may not be a memorable classic but it is a touching romance with an important theme that stresses the importance of literacy in modern society and the devastating career and life consequences for any unfortunate individual lacking this vital skill br br the story revolves around iris a widow who becomes acquainted with a fellow employee at her factory job an illiterate cafeteria worker named stanley iris discovers that stanley is unable to read and after he loses his job she gives him reading lessons at home in her kitchen of course as you might predict the two although initially wary of involvement develop feelings for each other br br jane fonda competently plays iris a woman with problems of her own coping with a job lacking prospects two teenage children one pregnant an unemployed sister and her abusive husband however robert deniro is of course brilliant in his endearing portrayal of the intelligent and resourceful but illiterate stanley bringing a dignity to the role that commands respect they aren't your typical charming young yuppie couple as generally depicted in on screen romances but an ordinary working class middle aged pair with pretty down to earth struggles br br i won't give the ending away but it's a lovely heartwarming romance and a personal look into the troubling issue of adult illiteracy albeit from the perspective of a fictional character
it is always a nice suprise when a film made for tv turns out to be entertaining such as little richard this is a very watchable film about the story of rock and roller little richard played by an actor called leon who i have never seen before but does an very good job as most tv films this is a little tamer than if made for cinema which is a shame because i am sure there is lot we could have seen about little richard that was controversial instead we see a lot religous rubbish which is the only thing that spoils the film and eventually spoilt a very promising career all in all this film is good and the acting is above average fot a tv film 7 out of 10
this a superb self contained work that is unconnected with anything before or after brat pack crooning and club exclusivity are not my biscuits of choice but in this law free world they make an alluring ambiance the film is packed with our guys distinctive actors who add distinction to this work with winning performances the dialogue is a joy in fact it's a new vernacular one of the few films that can be watched repeatedly with deepening appreciation br br highpoints include billy idol's british loutishness ben london's vulturine brassware kyle's squirmishness and the survey of ad hoc philosophies
not funny how can anyone link this to monty python that is absolutely ridiculous there are no laughs this is not funny over the top but ugly weird just for weird sake and it seems to me these people were on something all the time unfortunately something that did not make them funny br br it should be given some points for effort etc whatever actually it appears there is a laugh track or is there one hummm since there are barely any laughs that's a debatable question br br maybe i'm doing it injustice maybe it's some sort of exercise some sort of art in that case anything goes never mind br br but these guys playing women with high pitched voices turned up noses come on not funny br br there is only one heir apparent to monty pythons intellectual wit and that is stephen colbert and maybe jon stewart
amy heckerling's second film johnny dangerously is a parody of 1930's gangster films made in the warner brothers' tradition michael keaton stars as a middle aged gangster looking back at his life of hard knocks when he catches a kid trying to steal something from his pet store in 1935 keaton's mother maureen stapleton has continuing health problems so keaton falls into crime at an early age via peter boyle meanwhile the fargan richard dimitri plays a rival crime lord to boyle and keaton eventually rises through the ranks joe piscopo has a hilarious turn as danny vermin yeah that's right vermin griffin dunne is keaton's younger brother turned district attorney glynnis o'connor his wife and marilu henner plays keaton's moll the film looks notoriously cheap making it seem like a television show instead of a theatrical film br br the film starts out great and then slows down as expected after the first half hour due to the combination of dialog and gags the film holds its own for the first half but then it rapidly loses steam and descends into mediocrity and vulgarity in the second half keaton chews the scenery doing his best james cagney impression stapleton has several vulgar lines that are only obnoxious not funny piscopo does the once bit one time too many several supporting actors try to hold up the fort like danny devito dom deluise ray walston as a street vendor alan hale jr as a desk sergeant and sudie bond as an unscrupulous cleaning lady the second half evolves into a hit or miss television show type tone and never recovers the closing scene utilizing the roaring twenties is an anachronism as is the call of the wild clark gable film seen on a marquee earlier in the film i think heckerling should have known better since the targeted audience would certainly be aware of the roaring twenties' actual 1939 release date 1 2 of 4 stars
great western i hear you all say brilliant first effort well i'm not sure what film you all watched but it must have been a different one to the one i saw great westerns or indeed good films of any genre have characters you can believe in and this film had none the acting was poor to say the least and i couldn't care less about any of the characters making the whole film pointless the story was too big for the makers and perhaps they should try their hand at making straight to tv low budget rubbish like you see on those fact or fiction programmes on sci fi br br please if you are looking for a good film a great western or even just an enjoyable hour and a half please look elsewhere

before seeing this i was put off by the subject matter but this is not your average triumph over adversity story although this is technically about blind tibetan kids climbing mt everest there is so much more to it this movie shows the very strong often contradictory personalities of two highly accomplished blind adults leading the children erik and sabriye erik is an american blind mountain climber athlete and sabriye is a blind german academic who started a school in lhasa tibet they are both exceptional in their own ways but disagree on what will really build confidence in the kids erik wants them to reach the summit while sabriye wants them to enjoy erik as a role model and take pleasure in moment the nuances are complicated and one walks away not really being sure who was right or if the whole climb was a mistake or a great idea the most profound scenes are with the tibetan children themselves and the hardships they faced before finding their way to the school the most moving for me was the story of tashi a frail teenager who grew up on the streets after his parents abandoned him i could watch a whole movie on his life and was happy to learn that thanks to the school he is now running a successful small business with some of his fellow students if you liked spellbound or murderball you will love this
i was really horrified by this eerie movie what an unusual dark atmosphere and such a creepy musical score really promising indeed after ten minutes you really start sweating and feeling uncomfortable for you start fearing the worst this movie has the atmosphere of a true nightmare and what's worse it all comes out for one hour and a half i have been trying to fight complete boredom and falling asleep but the monstrous soundtrack kept me awake nuit noire is a truly horrifying picture for your eyes your ears your intelligence and most of all your wallet since the thought of spending precious money on a movie ticket for this cheap amateuristic homevideo is the biggest horror of all
i was lured to see this movie by its starpower but ultimately that's all it delivers it plays much more like a greek tragedy than a modern thriller about big city corruption it's greatest flaw is its predictibability and utter lack of suspense we know who the bad guys are from the beginning and just follow along as they fall like dominoes the film to its credit does abstain from gratuitous violence and sex but has forgotten to substitute good clean romance or excitement in any other way all the flavor of a good flat decaffeinated diet cola q a which also takes place in new york is a far better alternative as is la confidential
i expected to enjoy a romantic comedy featuring hip hop but was disappointed on many levels first of all the story is so badly recycled as to make it almost unbearable second the setting acting and story are not very authentic or believable third there are a lot more good black actors to choose from than these standard picks how about some originality third there were very few hip hop songs played in entirity if any none seemd really central overall film was a great disappointment but the editing style was very interesting and almost made the film worthwhile
the mother is one of those films that you know is good maybe even great but it is like eating vegetables or doing math homework is to a kid too much work and a whole lot of pain to get invested in br br the story is potentially distasteful in many ways the death of a character within the first half hour the december may romance the idea of a man cheating on his wife and then cheating on his lover with her mother the collection of weak and rather unpleasant thirty something characters the apparent indifference of the adults to the children in their lives this movie was made in the 2002 or 2003 but is a throw back to a collection of british usually made for tv movies from the late 1980's it has a moral severity that never lets up which produces an enveloping throbbing angst br br the mother is flawless but that is in part the problem if a film dealing with so many sensitive issues has some flaws inconsistencies of script some lesser actors it takes the edge off but if such a film is so pitch perfect the experience of watching it is raw and painful even the technical qualities lighting editing etc make the viewer ache the london in this movie is bright and open filled with harsh cutting light br br if you are tough as nails or are one of those super sensitive people who likes to torture themselves with gut wrenching sad movies or novels then you will enjoy the mother anyone in between give it a miss or be prepared to squirm and be warned as tough as the movie is from beginning to near end the worst is to come br br toward the end of the movie the mother asks her daughter what she can do to make up for it for having slept with her boyfriend and the daughter calmly says that she has thought about it and would like to hit her the mother agrees to this they both stand up and instead of a well primed slap the daughter clenches her fist and delivers a boxer's blow argh
this movie should have never been made from the poorly done animation to the beyond bad acting i am not sure at what point the people behind this movie said ok looks good lets do it i was in awe of how truly horrid this movie was at one point which very may well have been the worst point a computer generated saber tooth of gold falls from the roof stabbing the idiot creator of the cats in the mouth uh ooookkkk the villain of the movie was a paralyzed sabretooth that was killed within minutes of its first appearance the other two manages to kill a handful of people prior to being burned and gunned down then there is a random one awaiting victims in the jungle which scares me for one sole reason will there be a part two god for the sake of humans everywhere i hope not br br this movie was pure garbage from the power point esquire credits to the slide show ending
this movie is about basically human relations and the interaction between them the main character is an old lady who at the twilight of her life starts a journey to her past doing an analysis of how she lived her life this journey is precipitated because of the sons economic crisis and his intentions to put her in a nursing home it is a very honest look to some issues that we all ask ourselves at some point in life and there is plenty of secondary ideas to discuss in this movie such as family legacy real love marriage or destiny although this type of movie melodramas are nothing new this one can be useful to watch it with family members to discuss some ideas there is a good performance by the actors and the characters are very believable but because of the time some characters are maybe not fully developed i really recommend this movie for a quiet saturday afternoon
first off this is not supposed to be a brilliant and thought provoking film like so many other reviewers seem to compare it to the first review says something along the lines of anyone who likes this knows nothing about horror cinema apparently its the other way around if one were to look back after the film it really wasn't meant to be convincing it was a low budget ipecac but really thats all it was aiming for it was meant to blow viewers away with sheer shock value and all the flaws it its visuals were much less noticeable back in the original vhs versions br br i gave this one a high score because it reached its goal and even though it was not downright horrific in non shock sense it did make me slightly sick and thoroughly paranoid pessimistic i didn't trust anyone for about a week because i didn't want to wake up strung up and tortured
ohhh man now this is what i'm talking about as far as bad cheesy horror flicks go this movie was truly in a class of its own a real gem br br first off the film wasn't originally in english that's okay because the voice dubbing was truly exceptional here is my favorite excerpt from the dialog and there is plenty more where this came from  i'm feeling a little better i'm just thirsty for your blood br br and what drama here is a play by play recap of the interaction between the military and scientists br br scene 1 scientist you can't do that it'll be a disaster military officer that's just science fiction he then proceeds to cause a complete disaster just like the scientist predicted br br scene 2 scientist if you do that many people will die military officer you don't know what you're talking about he does it and many people die br br scene 3 scientist don't do that it'll kill everyone military officer that's nonsense he then proceeds to kill everyone br br scene 4 5 6 7 you get the idea br br if that wasn't enough there were a few scenes that really stood out as instant classics in one scene the military has literally 10 guys pointing guns at two unarmed men the leader yells go get 'em and all 10 army guys one at a time drop their guns and fist fight the two adversaries instant classic br br and don't worry no attention to detail was left out this movie even had a hip upbeat '80's keyboard synth soundtrack to set the mood br br and trust me i realize this review might contain some spoilers but there are so many goodies in this epic i really only scratched the surface a movie of this caliber only comes out once a decade a true movie watching experience a masterpiece wow
while to most people watching the movie this will be of little interest but out of the many hundreds of movies dealing with magic and the occult in one form or another this one is probably the best in many ways br br from the golem to the craft the subject seems to be of endless interest to the movie industry the majority of movies which touch on it in any way do so childishly for example witchboard a true piece of utter garbage in every way either taking the transcendental elements as cheap excuses for cheesy special effects or cardboard cutout villians cf warlock more frequently the subject comes up in an hysterical religious context in the various revelations oriented movies the antichrist is inevitably an advocate of some kind of new age style practice rarely a movie seems to show at least some passing experience with magic as it is practiced in real life but the presentation of the occult in such movies can at best be described as allegorical and not literal or symbolic or just not quite right br br i watched this movie again after many years tonight i had seen it before on vhs it is a dark moody piece and after watching it on dvd i would say if you have any intention to watch this movie watch it on dvd don't watch it on vhs br br the darkness and moodiness are overpowering in vhs but in dvd the movie takes on a very different tone i think weir pushed the dark aspects intentionally for style but when the movie is converted to the lower color medium of vhs this goes over the edge dvd brings the movie to life again and i saw it differently br br anyway seeing it as if for the first time i realized that the treatment of magic is extremely good in this movie it's difficult to go into all the reasons why i don't care to take the time to do so br br for anybody who's curious anyway if you want to see what it is like in real life this movie is just very right on countless levels br br and for anybody who isn't you really wasted a lot of time reading to this point
this familiar story of an older man younger woman is surprisingly hard edged bikers hippies free love and jail bait mix surprisingly well in this forgotten black and white indie effort lead actress patricia wymer as the titular candy gives the finest performance of her career spanning all of 3 drive in epics wymer was precocious and fetching in the young graduates 1971 but gives a more serious performance in the babysitter the occasional violence and periodic nudity are somewhat surprising but well handled by the director leads wymer and george e carey sell the may december romance believably there are enough similarities between the babysitter and the young graduates to make one wonder if the same director helmed the latter film as well patricia wymer where are you br br hailing from seattle wa miss wymer had appeared as a dancer on the tv rock and roll show malibu u before gracing the cover as well as appearing in an eight page spread of the august 1968 issue of best for men a tasteful adults only magazine she also appeared as a coven witch in the popular 1969 cult drive in shocker the witchmaker br br the babysitter has finally made its home video debut as part of the eight film bci box set drive in cult classics vol 3 which is available from amazon com and some retail stores such as best buy
if there was some weird inversed oscar academy awards festival this flick would win it all it has all the gods excellent plot extreme special effects coupled with extremely good acting skills and of course in every role there is a celebrity superstar well this could be the scenario if the world was inversed but it's not instead it's the worst horror flick ever made not only bad actors that seem to read the scripts from a teleprinter with bad dyslexia but also extremely low on special effects for example the devil costume which by the way is a must see is something of the most hilarious i've ever seen whenever i saw that red black so called monster on screen i couldn't hold my laugh back and to top of things it looked like the funny creature was transported by a conveyor belt br br do not do the same mistake as i did checking imdb seeing that the movie was released in 2003 had less than five votes and thinking well it's worth a shot can't be that bad br br yes it could br br i'm not even going to waste more words on this movie
made after quartet was trio continued the quality of the earlier film versions of the short stories by maugham here the three stories are the verger mr know it all and sanitorium the first two are comic the verger is like a prolonged joke but one with a good pay off and the last more serious as health issues are involved again the author introduces the film and the stories br br james hayter soon to have his signature role as samuel pickwick is the hero in the verger he holds this small custodial type job in a church but the new vicar michael hordern is an intellectual snob when he hears hayter has no schooling he fires him hayter has saved some money so he tells his wife kathleen harrison he fancies buying a small news and tobacco shop he has a good eye and his store thrives soon he has a whole chain of stores when his grandchild is christened by hordern the latter is amazed to see how prosperous his ex verger the payoff is when bank manager felix aylmer meets with hayter about diversifying his investments i'll leave it to you to hear the unintentional but ironic coda of the meeting br br according to maugham he met a man like max kelada nigel patrick on a cruise in mr know it all kelada is a splashy friendly and slightly overbearing type from the middle east who is on a business trip regarding jewelry by steamship his state room mate is mr grey the ever quiet and proper wilfred hyde white who is somewhat silently disapproving of max max likes to enliven things and soon is heavily involved in the ship's entertainment at this point the story actually resembles part of the plot of the non maugham story and film china seas 1935 as max makes a bet that he can tell a real piece of jewelry from a fake after insisting that a piece of jewelry he spotted is real i won't describe the way max rises to the occasion br br sanitorium is the longest segment roland culver plays ashenden the fictional alter ego of maugham a writer and one time spy as in hitchcock's the secret agent here he has to use a sanitorium for a couple of months for his health he finds a remarkable crew of people including jean simmons as a frail but beautiful young woman finlay currie as an irascible scotsman john laurie as a second irascible scotsman who is at war with currie raymond huntley as a quiet patient who only shows his internal anger at his situation when his wife shows up and michael rennie as a young man who has a serious life threatening illness culver watches as three stories among these characters play out to their conclusions the last dealing with simmons and rennie is ironic but deeply moving br br it was a dandy follow up to the earlier quartet and well worth watching
as if most people didn't already have a jittery outlook on the field of dentistry this little movie will sure make you paranoid patients squirm a successful dental hygienist witnesses his wife going down on the pool man on their anniversary of all days and snaps big time into a furious breakdown after shooting an attack dog's head off he strolls into work and ends up taking his marital aggression out on the patients as he plans what to do about his slut of a wife there are plenty of up close shots of mouth jabbing tongue cutting and beauty queen fondling as well as a marvelously deranged performance by corbin bernsen the scene in which he ties up and gases his wife before mercilessly yanking her teeth out is definitely hard to watch a dentist is absolutely the wrong kind of person to go off the deep end and this movie sure explains that in detail the dentist is incredibly entertaining fast paced and laughably gory at times check it out
i'm not kidding about that summary and vote the video distributors have packaged this as just another typical '80s werewolf movie but it is in fact the greatest parody of the horror genre that you can imagine having done for the horror movie what blazing saddles did for the western i have seen plenty of comedies good bad stupid weird etc usually walking away unimpressed and i think that comedy must be the most difficult genre for filmmakers and actors to work in it takes just the right kind of touch to make things successful and part of that is having good ideas full moon high is bulging with good ideas so many in fact that it can easily put the zucker abrams team of airplane and naked gun to shame one of the best of these is the very presence of ed mcmahon in a starring role as a john birch style right wing crackpot the jokes non sequiturs wisecracks and word play are literally non stop and everything including the kitchen sink has been thrown in the ironic tone is very similar to that of back to the future br br some people i e almost every reviewer here must have been turned off by the spirit of anarchy here but i almost died of laughter and this is one of those movies in which you never know what kind of insane situation will transpire next since b movie extraordinaire larry cohen had not made a straight comedy before this one gets the sense that he was making up for lost time by including any joke he or his collaborators could think of if mel brooks had made this the critics would have labelled it a comic masterpiece but because it was made by cohen it has been dismissed as schlock critical reviews have called this movie too silly silly what is a comedy supposed to be serious anyway i laughed out loud more for this movie than any other i can think of cohen makes fun of everyone himself included with plenty of references to his usual brand of low rent film making he and the actors must have had a complete blast making this br br the humor is very mel brooks ish and anyone who loves jewish humor or watches a lot of b movies especially horror will love this trust me the movie isn't too hard to find and as long as you accept it for what it is a roller coaster of belly laughs with no pretense of social value whatsoever then you'll truly enjoy it br br one sidenote this movie should somehow go down in history as the one thing bob saget ever starred in albeit briefly that was actually funny
louis sachar's compelling children's classic is about as disney as freddy krueger it's got murder racism facial disfigurement and killer lizards br br tightly plotted it's a multi layered interlinking story that spans history to reveal stanley's own heritage and the secret behind the holes it races from latvia's lush greenness to the pock marked camp green lake hint there's no lake and no green br br disney's first success is re creating the novel's environments so convincingly the set design is superb and without gloss the other plus is in the casting rising star shia labeouf charlie's angels 2 project greenlight might not be the fat boy of the book but his attitude is right and he's far from the usual clean cut hero the rest of the cast is filled out equally well from patricia arquette as the frontier school marm turned bank robber to henry winkler as stanley's dad the downside is the pop soundtrack pure marketing department and having the sentiment turned up to full volume at the end
the main problem with the documentary czech dream is that isn't really saying what it thinks it's saying br br in an audacious i hesitate to use the word inspired act of street theater vit klusak and filip remunda two student filmmakers from the czech republic pulled off a major corporate hoax to serve as the basis for their movie they deliberately fabricated a phony hypermarket the eastern european equivalent of costco or wal mart super store built an entire ad campaign around it replete with billboards radio and tv spots an official logo a catchy theme song and photos of fake merchandise and then waited around to see just how many dopes would show up to their creation on opening day they even built a makeshift façade to convince people that the store itself actually existed br br one might well ask why do such a thing well that's a very good question but the answer the filmmakers provide isn't all that satisfying a one essentially we're told that the purpose of the stunt was to show how easily people can be manipulated into believing something even something that's not true simply through the power of advertising and the movie makers run for moral cover by claiming that the real i e higher purpose for the charade is to convince the czech people not to fall for all the advertisements encouraging them to join the european union fair enough especially when one considers that the actual advertisers who agree to go along with the stunt declaim against the unethical nature of lying to customers all the while justifying their collaboration in the deception by claiming it to be a form of research into what does and does not work in advertising in a way by allowing themselves to be caught on camera making these comments these ad men and women are as much dupes of the filmmakers as the poor unsuspecting people who are the primary target of the ruse br br but in many ways the satirical arrow not only does not hit its intended target it ironically zeroes right back around on the very filmmakers who launched it for it is they themselves and not the good hearted and naturally trusting people who ultimately come off as the unethical and classless ones here as they proceed to make fools out of perfectly decent people some of them old and handicapped and forced to travel long distances on foot to get to the spot and what is all this supposed to prove anyway that people are greedy because they go to the opening of a new supermarket looking for bargains or that they're stupid and gullible because they don't suspect that there might not be an actual market even though one has been advertised such vigilance would require a level of cynicism that would make it virtually impossible to function in the real world br br no i'm afraid this smart alecky nasty little stunt only proves what complete and utter jerks the filmmakers are for making some really nice people feel like idiots and indeed many of them when they finally discover the trick that's been played on them react with a graciousness and good humor i'm not sure i would be able to muster were i to find myself in their position br br i'm not saying that the movie isn't gripping something akin to witnessing a massive traffic accident in action but when the dust has finally settled and all the disappointed customers return red faced and empty handed to their homes we can safely declare that they are not the ones who should be feeling ashamed
a woman who hates cats alice krige and her son brian krause have moved into a small town and must deal with a mean teacher glenn shadix their incestuous relationship a lovely girl mädchen amick and one hell of a big secret br br okay so technically this is a bad film but who cares it's so very fun br br impossible things involving corn happen people freak out about kitty cats there's bad one liners there's too much cheese to handle br br so yes you will enjoy this a lot it won't move you touch you scare you or thrill you in any way but it will keep you entertained and laughing
i'm a pretty old dude old enough to remember the taste of oreos and coke as they were 50 55 years ago when every taste for a kid was fresh i wish i have somehow set some aside then is some magical suspended locker so that i could taste those things today this magical locker might even have adjusted the fabric of the food to account for how i've drifted physically and otherwise a sort of dynamic chemistry of expectations over the half century they would have had to adjust quite a bit because you see i would have known that i set them aside eating one now would be a celebration of self and past and story and sense that would almost make the intervening years an anticipated reward br br i didn't have enough sense to do that with original coke and i couldn't have invented one of those magical psychic lockers  not then but i did something almost as good in the seventies i really tuned into roman polanski he was a strange and exotic pleasure  you know movies smuggled out of the soviet block movies so sensitive to beauty that you cry for weeks afterward movies that make you want to live with polish women one and then deciding that they would be the last to get it br br here's what i did i took what i knew would be my favorite polanski movie and set it aside i did not watch it i deferred until i thought i would be big enough to deserve it over the years i would test myself my ability to surround beauty and delineate it without occupying it there probably are few poles who have worked at this practicing to deserve chopin working to deserve womanness when i see it trying to get the inners from the edges br br recently i achieved something like assurance that it was time to pull this out i already knew that i was already past the time when this would work optimally because i had already seen and understood 9th gate br br if you do not know this it is about a man who innocently rents a room in which the previous tenant about whom the story is named jumped out the window to die later after this man played by polanski visits what happens is that time folds and he becomes this woman we are fooled into believing that he is merely mad but the way we follow him he is not he merely has flashes that the world is normal and that the surrounding people are not part of a coven warping his reality br br the story hardly matters what matters is how polanksi shapes this thing both in the way he inhabits the eye that only makes edges and in inhabiting the body that only consists of confused flesh the two never meet there is a dissonance that may haunt me for the next 30 years its the idea about and inside and an outside with no edges at all  at all except a redhead wig br br i know of no one else that could do this this sketch that remains a sketch this horror that remains natural br br to understand the genius of this you have to know one of the greatest films ever made rear window the genius of that film is the post noir notion that the camera shapes the world that the viewer creates the story what roman does is take this movie and turn it inside out in rear window the idea was that the on screen viewer jimmy stewart was the anchor and everything else was fiction woven as we watched here the on screen apartment dweller is the filmmaker we know this we know that everything we see is true because he is the narrator we know it is true that bodies shift identity that times shift that causality is plastic we know that the narrator will kill us we know that the narrator will leave us in a perpetual horror on that edge that he imputes but never shows us and lets us imagine br br ted's evaluation 4 of 3 every cineliterate person should experience this
when the us entered world war i the government forced hollywood to churn out propaganda films the little american is probably the best of the lot because it stars mary pickford br br pickford plays a young woman torn between two men jack holt german and raymond hatton french but her decision is delayed because of the war as both men enlist br br when the ship pickford is sailing on is sunk by the germans think lusitania because it is carrying munitions pickford has a great scene as she stands on the lifeboat and yells at the german commander later on of course she runs into both holt and hatton when she is being held as a war prisoner at a château br br director cecil b demille provides one truly great scene in this film as pickford and holt are wandering through a bombed out village they pass a destroyed church of which only one wall remains standing against the wall is a very large crucifix as they stand and watch the wall collapses but the jesus figure remains suspended in mid air it's a very surreal moment in a film that is otherwise very straightforward and un artsy br br pickford is as always a pleasure to watch she was always a very natural actress who avoided the arm waving histrionics many other actors of the day used she's also very very pretty holt is very good here in a leading man role hatton is ok among the list of name actors in extra parts are wallace beery ramon novarro colleen moore ben alexander hobart bosworth norman kerry walter long james neill and edythe chapman br br not a great film but interesting to see us propaganda at work
you do realize that you've been watching the exact same show for eight years right i could understand the initial curiosity of seeing strangers co exist on an island but you'd think that after watching unkempt stink ladened heroes run roughshod through the bush with an egg on a spoon for half a decade would be enough to get you to commit to something a little more original and interesting br br and i'm not even speaking of the shows validity which for the record i find questionable it's just hard to suspend disbelief for bushy bill eating a rat when the entire crew of producers and camera people are housed in an air conditioned make shift bio dome sipping frosty mochcinno's with moxy br br what's the appeal here i don't care about these people or their meandering lives i just don't get it but if you do find yourself being captivated by hairy unwashed people i suggest you turn off your tv and just take a trip to your local bus station where you can see people like this in their true habitat they call them homeless people and free of charge you can sit back and marvel in their uncanny ability to retrieve various cigarette debris from a plethora of garbage canisters eventually striking pay dirt and fashioning a homemade dr frankenstein styled cancer stick all the while begging people for change for food when the stink of aqua velva on their breath is enough to suggest otherwise and the best part much like survivor every week one member of the tribe leaves the island when they are unceremoniously sent packing to the local institution when the frightening unmedicated state of full blown schizophrenia kicks into gear now that's entertainment
the influence of hal hartley in adrienne shelly's i'll take you there is not overt but clearly has ties to his work shelly has acted in two of hartley's films not only does her film exhibit a very tight narrative but the hyper stylized and extreme characters strangely render human emotion in a very real light though this film is not ironic on the whole thank god the small and subtle ironies that pepper the piece allude to the bitter truths in love and loss with beautiful cinematography and a soundtrack straight from the seventies i'll see you there is a great indie film that doesn't stoop to postmodern irony when dealing with the woes of love and the reality of human emotion br br the film begins with bill's life falling to pieces not only has he sold his best friend ray a beautiful country home but his wife rose has left him in order to join ray in the retreat all washed up bill wallows in his own gloom and doom until his sister lucy played by the director adrienne shelly brings him all kinds of surprises a self help book and a date for her traumatized brother br br the unwilling bill tries to refuse but the sudden appearance of bernice at his door leaves him no choice no doubt bernice's initially superficial demeanor and ridiculous hairstyle detract from his ability to rebound with her however her pseudo hippie qualities annoy him so much that he lashes at her on their first date and bernice is so traumatized by his derogatory remarks that she attaches herself to him forcing herself upon him to what end we are not aware except for maybe the fact that she is psycho and who better to play the psycho than ally sheedy br br aware that bill desperately wants to see rose bernice offers her car but on the condition that he take her somewhere first on the way she proceeds to hold bill prisoner with his own gun a pinkerton detective no less an imbroglio of angst resentment redemption passion and violence ensue as bill and bernice find themselves on their way to the country home of ray and rose of course with a few stops along the way
an absolutely wretched waste of film nothing ever happens no ghosts hardly any train no mystery no interest the constant and brutal attempts at comedy are painful everything else is pathetic the premise is idiotic a bunch of people stranded in the middle of no place because their train was held up for less than 3 minutes what and the railroad leaves them no place to stay in a heavy storm i think not oh they can walk 4 miles across the dead black fields umm yeah sure or they can force themselves on the railroad's hospitality and stay at the 'haunted' train station a station which proved to be nothing but deadly boring utterly without ghosts interest or plot br br so very terribly dull that this seems impossible br br this ought to be added to the lost films list aargh
i went into watching this movie knowing it wasn't going to be great but what i witnessed was to awful for words i don't mean to be harsh its just the movie was terrible overall it had bad i mean awful special effects the acting wasn't too bad but wasn't good either and sasquatch himself was like well not sasquatch in my opinion the best sasquatch movie is harry and the hendersons its not violent or horror but it has the best depiction of sasquatch at least its a suit and not some half ass cgi rip off only see this movie if you are desperate or really appreciate anyone in the film or go watch boondock saints it is much better
any movie that portrays the hard working responsible husband as the person who has to change because of bored cheating wife is an obvious result of 8 years of the clinton era br br it's little wonder that this movie was written by a woman
i rated this film 7 10 which is an average of 8 10 for screenplay direction and 1944 production values and 6 10 for acting my acting rating in turn was calculated at 4 10 for all the screen characters except for that played by heroine ella raines as carol richman who was excellent at 8 10 also i commend thomas gomez as inspector burgess whose character convinces that he personally does not think the guilty verdict on scott henderson alan curtis was just in view of his naive alibi these two then form an alliance to prove scott's alibi br br i have this film on a suevia film noir cine negro dvd in spanish as la dama desconocida with the original soundtrack ingles as an alternative language since despite searching i could not find a wholly english version i was however anxious to see another performance by ella raines after being impressed with her performance as a heroine in impact playing a sole female garage proprietor here ella performs another heroic role believing in the innocence of her engineer boss and refuses several suggestions that she should return to her home in kansas her boss's pet name for her before solving the missing alibi the fact that she is secretly in love with her boss is a little hard to believe since he formally just seemed to have had a formal business relationship with her he had however designed children's homes and playgrounds so i suppose family man had lit up in carol's brain br br in the 1940s with the film code in operation producers could only portray sex through metaphors and here it is done in the form of furious drumming played by elisha cooke jnr carol dolls herself up as a girl of easy virtue in an attempt to lure the drummer into giving her information about the phantom lady alibi the other main character jack marlow an associate of scott henderson is played by franchot tone whose performance i found too theatrical and wondered why carol for instance did not notice him constantly and strangely admiring his hands here the screenplay should have been improved and provided more suspense as these theatrical moves telegraphed the plot far too early to the audience
the saddest thing about this film is that only 8 people cared to leave a review of it and no one felt it worthwhile leaving a comment on the message boards br br made the same year as philadelphia the tom hanks oscar winner this is the film that people really should have seen and given awards to there is more humanity life love tenderness and beauty in these two people than in just about any other gay film i have seen and it is all true br br in order for this to be printed i need to leave a few more lines of text suffice it to say that anyone who really wants to know what it was like to be gay in the 60's and 70's and to understand just what aids was like before the modern drug cocktails allowed people to breathe a little easier this is the film to see br br oh and i will add a personal comment about aids despite everything there actually has been a silver lining to all the horror when aids first arrived it was called the gay cancer and governments preferred to let them die rather than spend a red cent on research to help save a bunch of fags then it became clear that aids would also be a heterosexual disease but the government wasn't ready for that so when straight people began getting ill too the only organizations and associations that were available to them were those which had been set up by gays themselves examples the names project the quilt memorializing all those who died of aids act up etc the result is that people who probably would never have come in contact with gays in their ordinary lives suddenly found themselves counting on them and needing them because no other organizations existed this close contact in my estimation is what finally broke down the barriers of prejudice and allowed the straight world to finally accept gays as equals when aids first came on the scene many of us thought that the straight world would use it as a way to come down even harder on us and that probably would have been true if straights didn't suddenly become ill too nevertheless the strides that have been made in gay liberation to the point that as i write this there are at least 5 countries in the world that accept gay marriage these gains would probably have taken a lot longer without aids to bring us together it is sad to think that all those people both straight and gay had to die before our common humanity became more obvious but if what i am writing here is true and i think it is then there is a bit of comfort to be taken in realizing that all those people did not die in vain
granted i had seen some speed racer but i never really watched it and i had also seen other shows some featuring these characters dressed as birds who flew a ship called the phoenix and another revolving around a space ship that looked like a giant ocean vessel and it flew backwards at times for some reason and was really dark and hard to understand for someone who was maybe five this one though i watched nearly every episode and the amazing to me at the time was that this show had some resolution to it it actually ended the bad guys done in unlike nearly every american cartoon where nothing really concludes such as the last episode of the generation one transformers that ended with galvatron and this new bad guy vowing to get the autobots dungeons and dragons with the kids never making it home with gi joe with cobra still out there ready to try again and so on and so forth this one did end and did feature a rather cool robot that got new weapons as the show progressed it was a bit bland to begin with as it could not fly and had only a few really cool weapons as it went on he got a cool shooting fist like the one android 16 used against cell in dragonball z then that weapon evolved to include razors that shot out then the big robot even got wings so he could fly and even more weapons were incorporated into the wings he would also get a couple of allies in a female robot and a rather funny one called bobo in america the villains not only consisted of dr hell but a really weird person that was half man half woman and a dude with a flying head interesting show and it was kind of nice seeing a conclusion
cheap and mind blisteringly dull story and acting not a single good line not even a line bad enough to be good and no memorable delivery even the blooper reel included with the dvd showed how inept the actors were and how little fun any of them were having the esoteric and occult basis was apathetically inauthentic and the antagonists failed to be creepy or believable the 'homoerotic' overtones were pointlessly tame and dissatisfying and were limited to young boys caressing their chests while flaccid in their boxers i'm not gay enough to appreciate it but a little action might have at least kept me and my girlfriend awake
here's a review for people like me this movie sucks from beginning to end i threw popcorn at the screen and resorted to entertaining myself a la msf2000 the plot hinges on chance happenings and relies on stupidity from people who are supposed to be smart the lead falls for a con man and it doesn't occur to her that she might get conned and she's rich and she's a famous psychologist come on people she enters the bar at just the most convenient moment when everyone is assembled to talk about conning her that was so staged that it felt like slap in the face to even half witted movie viewers rain man would have been insulted i also admit that i despise mamet dialogue with the kind of passion that some people have for meat eaters war starters and fur wearers my hatred is so complete that it defies logic but i'll give it a shot that it's not supposed to sound real is fine i don't care it's that everyone talks the same mamet can't create characters all he can do is foist his voice on us relentlessly through different actors no wonder his actors are so wooden they're confused about everyone being the same character however his later films do improve
to those who have not followed the anne marie fahey murder case you are missing out one of the saddest yet complicated murder of all the murderer is popular delaware attorney tom capano and the victim is the delaware governor's scheduling secretary anne marie fahey their relationship was a well kept secret until her disappearance and murder she wanted to leave him but he just wouldn't let her go so easily on the other hand he had a mistress and a wife and four daughters where did he find the time to have two mistresses and a domestic family life besides the case is extremely complicated and fascinating for a four hour mini series while the actress who plays ms fahey does a fine job she does not have her dark long hair his other mistress is definitely more attractive than the actual woman mark harmon is better looking and does an emmy award winning performance as tom capano it would be better with actual delaware and philadelphia locations with ann rule's executive producing she adds accuracy to anne marie's characteristic of organization and her personal battle with an eating disorder these bits of information might be overlooked by any other executive producer or director if you have not read the book it is well worth it ann rule is a fascinating storyteller of true crime it is ironic that mark harmon plays tom capano he also played ann rule's former friend and subject ted bundy in an another book adaptation many years ago he was brilliant then and now he does an above average job with an amazing story even president clinton offered his assistance in the anne marie fahey case and now the former governor tom carper is now the united states senator for delaware who defeated longtime popular incumbent senator richard roth in the november 2000 election if you don't think the movie is interesting then the read rule's book
the class is a comedy series that portrays a bunch of 27 year old former class mates br br i like the idea of the show that's why it saddens me that the class is not funny even though it has the obvious potential it's not enough corky just dorky haha this is due to a slowish tempo and the lack of actually hilarious punch lines also some actors have difficulties with timing br br most inventively written characters are the twins kat and lina warbler lizzy caplan and heather goldenhersh but even they seem just a little too square for the good of the show on the other hand the characters i find most uninteresting are the main character ethan and the used to be couple duncan and nicole br br what bothers me with the series is that the only latino character aaron is being picked on for his accent even though by a non respectable character but anyway
this 1991 nbc tv movie aired six months before john goodman's big screen version of the life of babe ruth came out for my money there is no comparison between the two the tv production isn't perfect but it presents the babe's story with more depth and complexity than goodman's one dimensional telling i especially enjoyed the film's depiction of the complex love hate relationship ruth had with yankee manager miller huggins who always understood his star player's brilliance and also kept trying to point out why ruth's own character flaws would never let him become a manager or leader of players the tv movie rightly notes how ruth never fulfilled his dream of managing the yankees because of his flaws while the horrible goodman version tries to push the falsehood that ruth was denied what should have been his for the taking br br this film makes a great companion piece to eight men out since the story starts with ruth's arrival in new york in 1920 one year after the black sox scandal and when his home run exploits literally saved baseball from ruin indeed the continuity between the two films is even accentuated with john anderson reprising his eight men out role as commissioner kenesaw mountain landis
i usually enjoy loretta young's early movies her acting back then was light and breezy and she sure knew how to wear clothes but this one is just a loser from the word go except for a funny supporting turn by glenda farrell young is a hatcheck girl who talks her writer husband paul lukas into becoming a championship bridge player it's not the most cinematic of games and the long talky middle part in which their marriage falls apart just about kills the film br br there's one interesting bit though as lukas and ferdinand gottschalk start their climactic game a series of quick shots show airplanes trains football games even a diver in mid air freezing in anticipation of the event it's the earliest use of a freeze frame i've seen in an american film wish the rest of it were that inventive and funny
this has the absolute worst performance from robert duval who sounds just like william buckley throughout the entire film his hammy melodramatic acting takes away from any dramatic interest i'm not sure if this was deliberate scene stealing or inadvertent but it's the only thing i can recall from a truly forgettable film this picture should be shown in every amateur acting class of an example of what not to do thank god duvall went on to bigger and better things and stopped trying to effect a cultured accent he is a good character actor but that's about it klaus is so much better his performance is muted and noteworthy
it really boggles my mind when someone comes across a movie like this and claims it to be one of the worst slasher films out there this is by far not one of the worst out there still not a good movie but not the worst nonetheless go see something like death nurse or blood lake and then come back to me and tell me if you think the night brings charlie is the worst the film has decent camera work and editing which is way more than i can say for many more extremely obscure slasher films br br the film doesn't deliver on the on screen deaths there's one death where you see his pruning saw rip into a neck but all other deaths are hardly interesting but the lack of on screen graphic violence doesn't mean this isn't a slasher film just a bad one br br the film was obviously intended not to be taken too seriously the film came in at the end of the second slasher cycle so it certainly was a reflection on traditional slasher elements done in a tongue in cheek way for example after a kill charlie goes to the town's 'welcome' sign and marks the population down one less this is something that can only get a laugh br br if you're into slasher films definitely give this film a watch it is slightly different than your usual slasher film with possibility of two killers but not by much the comedy of the movie is pretty much telling the audience to relax and not take the movie so god darn serious you may forget the movie you may remember it i'll remember it because i love the name
loved it what's not to like you got your suburbia you got your zombies you got your family issues you got your social dilemmas you got yourself one fine retro 1950's style flesh eating under class held at bay by an uneasy worried about whether they're the next meal upper crust you couldn't ask for more br br cast is superb carrie ann moss is absolute perfection as a debutante social climbing housewife she's both wanton and criminally conspiratorial every fellow's dream k'sun is really great as the son just trying to be as normal as possible in this nightmare existence and somehow succeeding he's a genuine screen presence very photogenic and natural without naming them all the rest of the cast is wonderful henry czerny plays a suspicious policeman with honed instincts and little squeamishness as if it's his everyday persona billy connolly is delightful as fido a fine actor i wish that he had played the title role in braveheart with gibson directing my sense is that his william wallace would have been closer to the actual character his fido is contained yet accessible a nice touch br br in short a great and marvelous satiric poke at morals values social pinnings feelings growth coping in uncertain times and compensatory adjustments to impossible conditions a true reality show
i attended one of the premieres last night and have the following observations br br 1 just because you've directed a ton of music videos does not make you qualified to make movies the movie had an overabundance of lingering shots that made no sense horrible angles and terrible lighting the editing didn't help this mess at all when dixie shows up late for the memorial service her mother remarks about her hand but it's never clear what the heck she's talking about br br 2 the plot had promise but the script was thin and full of ford truck sized holes we never get to understand what drives the characters what's really behind the conflicts they all have with each other or exactly how they resolve them sixteen years of distance is wiped out in 4 days seemingly by magic the deep conversations were marred by stupid clichés in fact the whole town was one big cliché of southern life half the audience groaned when toby drawled ya got my blood runnin through your veins gurl and we were treated to that insipid line not once but twice the revelations were yawn inducing and the dramatic confessions boiled down to i was stupid and stubborn br br 3 the acting was okay considering the wreck of a script they had to work with toby was dark and brooding most of the film but when he smiled and lightened up he was charming it's a shame he didn't have more screen time like that kelly preston's acting chops are pretty rusty and it shows lindsay haun is talented and it's certainly not her fault the writers made her character so unlikeable in the beginning that you don't blame her father for not coming to look for her burt reynolds and tess harper were able to make more of this movie but still looked more or less lost and indeed their characters get lost in this film br br 4 if you're a toby fan you'll love the songs but often the movie felt like a scene was forced in just so they could feature one of his songs or the artists on his record label for instance the movie's official love song is crash here tonight you'd think that would play around a tender love scene but nope we hear about 45 seconds of it as he's heading to a memorial service it was as if they said well we gotta use this song somewhere the song broken is haunting and the best thing to come out of this movie br br in summary a promising plot never fully develops and the movie is horribly uneven as it forceably tries to be a vehicle for toby keith's music and product placement for ford trucks it goes from being about people rebuilding broken bridges to trying to be about the power of music but the story is told so poorly that both points get lost in this overgrown music video i like toby and really wanted to like broken bridges but the people he counted on to make this movie let him down and deserve one of his famous boots you know where
it was supposed to be the last freddy movie and it was for over 10 years you would think they would have tried to get a good movie done but they turned out giving us the worst of the series and that's saying a lot the plot made no sense i seriously can't remember it all the main characters were idiots you really wanted them dead and freddy's wisecracks were even worse than usual the only remotely good bit about this was a brief and funny cameo by johnny depp the first nightmare movie was his first br br also i originally saw it in a theatre were the last section reaccounting freddy's childhood was in 3 d well the 3 d was lousy faded colors and the image going in and out of focus also the three flying skulls which were supposed to be scary i think had the opposite reaction from my audience everybody broke down laughing looks even worse on tv in 2 d pointless and stupid very dull also skip this one and see freddy vs jason again
this is a poor film by any standard the story in match point had a certain intrigue and the direction and writing a certain fascination woody allen mixing his own culture with that of the classic english murder and exploring what can be done with it br br scoop however has none of this it is poorly written the two leads are hopelessly wooden and the story itself has no interest at all the genre that it spoofs requires at least some sort of subplot with witty explanations and tie ups why are tarot cards and keys kept under french horns in locked rooms br br allen's delightful and witty versions of various hollywood genres curse of the jade scorpion purple rose of cairo etc have given us so much pleasure over the years even hollywood ending had a great central idea sadly his inspiration has deserted him this time
for years we've been watching every horror film that comes out from the dull hollywood retreads like saw 2 to awful indie releases that are completely unmatchable we suffer through all of bad films in hopes of finding little gems like dark remains br br we managed to catch a screening of this film at shriekfest 2005 the audience loved it and i believe it ended up winning the award for the best film br br while it may not have the budget or star power of studio films it packs a serious punch in the creepy atmosphere and scare category the acting and cinematography are top notch but it's the direction that makes this film worth the view the story and characters develop at just the right pace to provide some fantastic scares br br the editing and visual fx are also top notch and while many horror films don't manage to use music to their benefit the score for dark remains only adds to it's creepiness br br i know the film has shown at a bunch of festivals but none have been near me so i can't wait to hear when it'll finally be coming out on dvd trust me even if you're sick of the current state of horror films give this one a try you won't regret it
this film enhanced my opinion of errol flynn while flynn is of course best known for his savoir faire and sprezzatura to throw in a couple of high falutin' european terms this film gives him an opportunity to stretch albeit only slightly as an actor as he plays an unabashed social climber with a big ego and a sense of nerve to match the supporting cast is excellent everyone seems well chosen for their roles br br the story moves briskly and while not particularly profound it misses perhaps intentionally the opportunity to render social commentary on the massively uneven distribution of income during that time it certainly entertains and satisfies from what i know of jim corbett the story is also reasonably faithful to history i also really liked the great depictions of 1880s san francisco all in all there's little not to like about this film very well worth the time to watch it
i recorded this ages ago but only got round to watching it today i have been ill so had run out of stuff to watch i am so glad i saw it and which i could erase my memory and watch i again for the first time this movie is so wonderful it reminded me very much of fried green tomatoes at the whistlestop cafe br br the story goes back in time and at the end of the movie we see what the connections are some people have said this is a kids movie i disagree it may be made by disney and many characters are children but i am 23 and i loved it there were moments when my spine tingled the story is unlike any other film these days full of adventure i have just ordered the book from amazon can't wait
this is one of the worst movies i've ever seen i saw it at the premiere at sxsw and was extremely disappointed the director knew little about john lennon and even said as much at the premiere this is a drama but people were laughing throughout at how cheesy the film was that's never a good sign the only saving graces were dominic monaghan and jason leonard as livien's roommates bandmates they were funny while the rest of the movie took itself waaay too seriously the cheesy dropping of beatles lyrics was just absurd the soundtrack was excellent however and was probably the best part of the movie unless you're one of those crazy rabid dominic monaghan fans don't bother with this one
this can't be mandy schaffer's last film somebody do something br br argh br br what little life this one might have had the directing finished off don't blame the cast they did ok even the winemaker's younger brother was pretty well done and he didn't even get into the movie until halfway through and please please put mandy in some more movies she's too beautiful to bury her career at such a young age ya' breakin' my haht heah br br two specific criticisms in case anyone cares apparently nobody liked this movie very much first the way traci kept popping up at just the right melodramatic moment in order to see whatever she was supposed to see and never got seen in return was very annoying hollywood please stop giving villains perfect timing luck which runs out exactly when the climax arrives it's dumb write better scripts so you won't have to use that lame plot device any more if your script isn't good enough to stand up without that then don't produce it br br second carmen wouldn't have fallen for that fake injury trick that traci pulled she already had traci fingered more bad writing directing there br br i could trash this movie further but mercy forbids it actually i didn't hate it as much as the others seem to have it just didn't have much of a reason for being made unless it was purely a vehicle to show off the lovely mandy oh and to whoever didn't think she was sexy the character wasn't very well written but how can you say she wasn't sexy one or the other of us needs glasses and i don't think it's me br br more mandy not to be confused with moore mandy although i'd like to see her again too br br p s did i mention i hope mandy makes me more movies d
the goofy griswalds win the t v game show pig in a poke grand prize and all fly off together to europe where they manage to cause one stupid disaster after another of all the ridiculous unfunny money spinning sequels this one beats the lot harold ramis' 1983 film was a below average misadventure in which the misfit family went on a nightmarish vacation across the states this time amy heckerling look who's talking helms what turns out to be a disastrous comedy which will annoy you more than it will make you laugh br br hughes script with rob klane is awful and you wonder why the likes of chevy chase and beverly d'angelo bothered with such a dead beat project as even anthony michael hall and imogene coca had the sense to decline the offer even an omnipotent michael palin is unable to lift proceedings to any level that one could call entertaining br br yet as inconceivable as it may seem european vacation was successful enough to warrant a second sequel surely it couldn't be as unbearable as this one you know i have yet to see a national lampoon show that was worth the bother br br monday december 26 1994 t v
yes the plot is hardly plausible and very thin yes the acting does range from average to laughable yes it has been done so many times before however what we are dealing with is a film that does not shy away from these facts and pretends to be nothing more than it is there are indeed some original death scenes and the tension does increase throughout the movie in addition you are never more than a few minutes away from a gory killing i urge everyone to watch this film with an unprejudiced eye and see it for what it set out to be a scary funny slasher flick with a theme tune second to none
i have only seen gretchen mol in two other films girl 6 donnie brasco and don't really remember her but she did a great job as a naive girl who posed for pictures because it made people happy br br she really didn't think what she was doing was wrong even when she left the business and found her religion again br br the photos she made were certainly tame by today's standards and it is funny seeing men with cameras get all excited and politicians pontificating on the evils of pornography david strathairn good night and good luck played a super part here br br mary harron american psycho wrote and directed an outstanding biopic of the most famous pinup girl ever
the message of a world on the brink of war is disregarded by the masses the mythical city of everytown in 1940 represents england in general but it could just as well stand for any nation of the world when war finally does arrive it's ravages continue not for another five years but until 1966 at which time everytown is completely destroyed adding to the desolation and toll on humanity is the wandering sickness a pestilence that continues for another four years br br things to come balances both a fatalistic and futuristic world view where science holds out a hope for a revived civilization the wings over the world concept plays out a bit corny though it's spokesman cabal raymond massey is unwavering in his mission and dedicated to his cause if he fails others will follow this message is continually reinforced throughout the film brought home convincingly in massey's end of movie speech man's insatiable need to test the limits of knowledge and achievement requires an all the universe or nothing mindset br br the film's imagery of automation and machinery in the second half is reminiscent of the great silent film metropolis as everytown is rebuilt and transformed by the year 2036 the spectacle of the city's rebirth strikes a resonant chord as architecture of modern cities of today suggest the movie's eerily prophetic vision is coming to fruition where the movie gets it wrong by sixty seven years though is man's first mission to the moon but in 1936 a hundred year timetable probably seemed more legitimate than 1969 br br things to come is one of those rarities in film a picture that makes you think which side will you come down on the forces for advancement in the face of uncertainty or maintain the status quo it's not a comfortable question as both choices offer inherent dangers and unknowable outcomes those who choose to be bystanders risk being swept away by forces beyond their control
phantasm class phantasm ii awesome phantasm iii erm terrible br br even though i would love to stick up for this film i quite simply can't the movie seems to have sold out first bad signs come when the video has trailers for other films at the start something the others did not also too many pointless characters prime examples the kid who is a crack shot funny initially but soon you want him dead the woman who uses karate to fight off the balls erm not gonna work or rather shouldn't and the blooming zombies what the hell are they doing there there no link to them in the other phatasms also there is a severe lack of midgets running about br br the only good bits are the cracking start and of course reggie b br br possible spoiler coming up br br to me this film seems like a filler between ii and iv as extra characters just leave at the end so can continue with main 4 in iv br br overall very very disappointing 3 10
i love science fiction i am fascinated by egyptian mythology and i appreciate digital animation i figured a movie that combines these three would be at least enjoyable i could not have been more wrong the story or actually the lack there of was completely uninspired and lacks imagination while imagination usually is the biggest component of any science fiction story the dialogue and acting are even worse than in an average porno movie especially thomas kretschmann gives new meaning to the term 'bad performance' bad acting wouldn't have been such a huge problem if only 'director' bilal didn't take himself so seriously all the lines sound like they are supposed to be poetic it looks like bilal really thinks he has made a piece of art here well there's no art or poetry to be found in this piece of junk only pretentiousness this man should really stick to making comics since he fails on all possible accounts as a director worst of all is the terrible digital animation which is so ugly that it actually turns watching this movie into a physically painful experience the graphics look so fake they even make the werewolves in 'van helsing' look like live actors and since half the characters are cgi animated it is quite a problem that the cgi effects look so fake if the egyptian gods actually exist then bilal's a dead guy since they will no doubt take gruesome revenge on him for the ridiculous way in which he portrays them in this disastrously bad movie
i am a huge fan of david lynch this film however was a quite disappointing experience apart from the ambient background music  which really sets the mood of the film  it lacks almost all the qualities that i've come to associate with lynch's work the visuals are dull to say the least and the dialog is to vague and monotone to be of any interest br br this feels more like a film students awkward try to do an arty dogma movie than the work of an experienced director i've seen a lot of amateur movies with far superior camera work scenery sound and script this film lacks almost all artistic qualities i feel as though i'm watching one of davids home videos produced during a weekend trip with some friends
another movie to suffer without an adventure to run no enigma to solve just an illness man acting like an animal no a good reason to take this journey pitt and lewis are great actors magnificent michelle forbes but a weak david duchovny performance
this movie was so bad outdated and stupid that i had rough times to watch it to the end i had seen this rodney guy in natural born killers and i thought he was funny as hell in it but this movie was crap the jokes weren't funny actors weren't funny anything about it wasn't even remotely funny don't waste your time for this only positive things about this were the beautiful wives and molly shannon who i'm sure tried her best but the script was just too awful that's why i rated it 2 instead of 1 but it's definitely one of the worst films i've ever seen
an imagination is a terrible thing to waste especially when you have talented actors writer director jones wastes no time in siding the viewer with his protagonist br br anyone who has shared an apartment with a slob will be crying with laughter anyone who has arrived while a meter maid places a ticket on your windshield will just plain cry we've all wanted to rip a terrible toupee off a man's head these are only snippets of what's in store when watching cross eyed a heartfelt film that should be a stepping stone for jones and his wry sense of humor both in front and behind the camera
this movie features charlie spradling dancing in a strip club beyond that it features a truly bad script with dull unrealistic dialogue that it got as many positive votes suggests some people may be joking
this is a so called 'feel good' movies however it made me sad in a way why because i had the talent but my parents didn't let me study at the sports academy as well the fact that at the age of 12 i decided to quit soccer br br and soccer is the red line in this movie together with the struggle youngsters have with the expectations parents have an english indian girl and her parents with their traditions and strong family ties and on the other hand the english family with a daugther who dresses like a boy and plays soccer a combination which worries her mother this movie also lines out the lives of ordinary people as well as the indian community in england it is about believe in your dreams and live your one life where did we hear that before br br paraminder nagra a beautiful women plays yasminda a girl who is not interested in boys new clothes make up and the typical 17 year old girl stuff in contradiction with her sister pinky complete the opposite of yasminda br br a real must it is to see how a young beautiful girl struggles with the traditions of their parents and finds her luck eventually with great music from blondie curtis mayfield texas melanie c as well as indian hit songs br br pleasant to watch but if you as myself ever played soccer and never made it to the top then this movie will make you melachonic
this tim burton remake of the original planet of the apes from 1968 and starring charleton heston is a far far cry from the quality and plot of the original br br certainly special effects have improved since 1968 but writing has not the characters were boring and the dialog was awful i sat through the entire film with a friend who thankfully only rented it and completely understood why before christmas all of the planet of the apes toys at target were in the clearance bin br br my advice to tim burton don't put this on your resume br br my advice to everyone else watch the original 1968 planet of the apes movie
over the years we've seen a lot of preposterous things done by writers when the show just had to go on no matter what keeping 8 simple rules going after john ritter died comes to mind but this is probably the first time i cared the idea of having that 70's show without eric or to a lesser extent kelso is ridiculous they tried to cover it up with a comeback of leo and increasingly outrageous story lines but it always felt like why bother when you don't have a main character anymore it just didn't really connect it was a bunch of unrelated stuff happening that most of the time wasn't even funny the last season felt like the season too much for every single character simply because eric used to take a lot of screen time and now we'd be smashed in the face by how stale and repetitive the rest of the characters were focusing on the gimmick that is fez was thoroughly uninteresting and the character would simply stop working because the whole deal was that he'd say something weird from out of nowhere and you can't say stuff from out of nowhere when every second line is yours they also brought in the standard cousin oliver only this time it just wasn't a kid whenever you heard somebody knock on the door you started praying it wasn't randy please let it not be randy the deal with randy was that he'd do really awful jokes usually as red would say smiling like an ass and totally screwing up delivery and donna would be in stitches i think more than half of the last season was donna pretending to be amused the problems had started earlier though what once was a truly great show with an equally great concept that for once wasn't about a dysfunctional family slowly got into the territory of soap opera everybody started being in love with everybody emotional scenes were dragged out at nausea with just one usually lame joke placed somewhere to divert attention that we were watching as the world turns i'm guessing this was character development but come on that was written almost as clumsily as the moral lessons from family matters to be fair the last episode also because it had a cameo by topher grace a cameo in his own show was really good even if not that funny either br br by the way yet more criticism on season 8 what the hell was with the opening theme not only did they use the same joke twice a character not singing fez scared the hell out of me dude don't open your eyes that far but the first five seasons or so among the best comedy ever broadcast
the movie had so much potential but due to 70's technology constraints and also a weak script killed the main plot of the film the book version of the film was much better and well conceived if it had been done right in the beginning with sources from the book it could have been a very cool classic
an average tv movie quality totally formula story of religious fanatic ron perlman who gives good i'm not just the president of 'psychos r us ' i'm also a client who gets control of a biochemical virus think the virus from the movie the rock too bad for him that he also gets stuck in a bank building during an earthquake with bank robbers and the government agents trying to stop him led by the impressively physiqued mildly entertaining wolf larson backed by fred dryer along with the standard in the wrong place at the wrong time spunky female the forever bland erika eleniak and lived as a wimp but died as a hero at the last minute male brandon karrer has the standard background story to give sympathy to the religious fanatic wife and son killed in a police raid a few years previous br br basically a decent rainy day movie br br favorite line spoken by ron perlman after he finds the vial of the virus hidden in erika eleniak's cleavage a woman and her mystery br br worth a rent
it's often said that tobe hooper just struck lucky with his grisly 1974 horror film 'the texas chain saw massacre' and every time i see another hooper film that view is only reinforced it would seem that hooper wanted to make his own version of films such as scanners and firestarter in 1990 and so we end up with spontaneous combustion a film with a couple of good ideas and a whole load more that are borrowed from other films put it all together and you get a messy boring film that most people would do well to miss the film leads the audience to believe that it might be half decent initially with an intriguing back story that focuses on some experiments carried out on two young people in the fifties the couple have a child and shortly thereafter burn to death as a result of the experiments done on them fast forward some years and the baby is now an adult named sam but naturally he's not a normal person and soon finds when it's discovered that he has the ability to set things on fire at will br br the film stars brad dourif who must have seemed like a good casting choice given his success with child's play two years earlier but actually was an uninspired decision as the central performance is really terrible and not helped by the terrible supporting performances the turgid direction and dull script also don't do the film many favours and the trend of lacking in favours is continued by the special effects which are very unrealistic and have nothing on the films that this one is ripping off all of which were made some years earlier the plot is really slow and it's almost an hour before anything of note happens and i didn't care for it even then it soon becomes obvious which direction the film will go in and it all boils down to the sort of tedious ending you would expect the final confrontation is a big disappointment and nothing is really explained during the film not that any revelation would have been interesting anyway overall this is a rubbish film and another reason why tobe hooper is a long way from being a great horror director see firestarter again instead
i find myself comparing all stand up acts to this one performance now even older recorded performances i once thought were funny just don't seem as funny after seeing eddie izzard in this award winning look at history language disparities and englebert humperdink
a terrible storyline amis at his worst pointless and self conscious 'decadence' obvious shock tactics and patchy acting make this film rather like rancid aluminium embody everything that went wrong with the much vaunted british film revival the humour is at best limp and the pretentiousness of the whole set up including some kind of internet terrorist group ooh how contemporary really begins to grate br br final summary a half baked attempt to be 'edgy' that does no one any favours still it's always a pleasure to see katy carmichael on screen br br
this was on the 30th anniversary dvd for blazing saddles itself brilliant but not this nowhere did i see mel brook's name on here and i can guess why he's got a lot more sense to not be associated with this pilot my gawd who would find this funny sure there may be a race issue but for me it just wasn't funny well cause it's simply not funny it's like the writers didn't even try to be funny just to cash in on being tied with blazing saddles did they expect this show to go for several seasons when they made this pilot flat out they didn't care it was a quick cash cow which thank god didn't cash out i guess it's useful for historical purposes only or only to demonstrate how stupid and unimaginative hollywood writers can be
i thoroughly enjoyed this true to form take on the dick tracy persona this is a well done product that used modern technology to craft a imagery filled comic era story if you are a fan of or recently watched some of the old dick tracy b w movies then you're sure to get a kick out of this rendition the pastel colors and larger than life characters rendered in a painstakingly authentic take on an era gone by is entertainment as it's meant to be i personally find madonna's musical element to be a major part of this film the cd featuring her music from this movie is one i've listened to often over the years it's just so well done and performed musically and tuned to that era in my mind madonna's finest moment both on screen but especially musically this is sure to bring out the kid in you
i saw this film last night following a lot of good reviews from many sources i would like to point out that if your not ready to try and work out continuously who is who and what it all means you will hate this film br br i am still struggling to understand the roles of the actors in this film the film jumps from different stories and does not allow you to really empathise with any of the roles br br for the political buff's and those interested in corruption in other world governments out there this film is probably quite good but to the average movie watcher this film is awkward very boring in places and you will leave the cinema confused and annoyed that you paid the entrance fee br br see it if your ready to focus 100 on every minute detail or politics interest you don't see it if you actually like watching films
well the movie isn't exactly funny br br okay i admit there are a few humorous lines but definitely nothing that is laugh out loud funny for example right before a steamy sex scene between eleniak and one of her male costars sh is handcuffed to the bedpost and he cannot remove her shirt before leaving the room to retrieve the key he tells her okay don't go anywhere br br see humorous but not funny br br the plot and acting are pretty good br br but erika eleniak definitely steals the show she's hot and sexy and there is a really steamy scene with her that one can't help but rewind and re watch br br there are also some other very sexy scenes with her and she has some very provocative lines br br overall 5 stars i'd only give it three if not for erika eleniak
wow i loved this film it may not have had the funding and advertising that the latest hollywood blockbusters get but it packs twice the emotional punch the tale revolves around this one family from utah and it's the connections between the people in the family that provide the film with its punch the main lead giovanni ribisi plays his part very well at no time does he leave you to believe that he's acting all his feelings it's his brother elias koteas who stole the show for me though when the two were in scenes together they bounded their lines off of each other giving fantastic performances great cast great film
i'm really surprised this movie didn't get a higher rating on imdb it's one of those movies that could easily get by someone but for romantic comedy moonstruck is really in a class by itself it's setting and ethnic charm are things people seem to take for granted the casting alone makes it a nearly perfect movie few movies in the 1980's were as good as moonstruck and it's funny too out of
this movie is a re write of the 1978 warren beatty movie heaven can wait but it is written for the stand up comedic style of mr rock the premise remains the same lance barton rock is taken before his life time is up and works a deal with god's representative mr king to come back to earth as someone else as in beatty's movie he chooses the murdered charles wellington a rich white man all because he fancies sontee jenkins regina king who happens to turn up at wellington's house during the murder the role of mrs wellington and her lover suffers in this remake and the idea to turn an aged white multi millionaire into a stand up black comedian who tries to woo sontee simply does not work also the intercuts used to show rock as wellington and then as the real 'white' wellington fail miserably improvements could have been made to the original beatty plot which in itself did not masterfully portray the life after death idea but they certainly were not to be found in down to earth
i couldn't believe some of the horrible dialog coming out of people's mouths and the end reel of bloopers attached to body of the film was a real hoot and we get titty shots of angelique pettyjohn sort of and loren crabtree to boot br br a teleportation device activated by psychic angelique pettyjohn brings an alien container to an underground lab out in the desert according to director fred olen ray they were leftover sets from the klaus kinski film android which gives the film an increased value beyond how cheap it looks br br inside the container is a midget alien played by ray's son who starts clawing people to death it was pretty funny watching this little 'creature' in a black reptile suit with what looks like large beetle shells attached to it running around in the dark we even get to see the little thing stamp and tear at a poster of et which i thought was hilarious br br and then there's what looks like a snake that also comes out of the container that gets hammered to death by william fair after the mini creature chews into frank mcdonald's neck in the kitchen a low budget take on alien i suppose br br the whole thing ends abruptly looking like they ran out of film at the end before the blooper reel comes in with the end credits talk about a lack of funding br br fred olen ray also mentions in the director's commentary that they also weren't sure if aldo ray would make through the shooting and remember his lines he barely did br br low budget cheese sneeze it's fun to watch i'll grant ya that br br 4 out of 10
a hint i think may be gathered by the various comments on this thread br br i was quite amazed at the number of people who liked this film who want to make it mandatory or compulsory br br i think this gives us a little bit of insight into the reason this film and the issue underlying it is so polarizing br br the global warming issue appeals a lot to people who want to force others to do right it appeals particularly to more liberal leaning people because it doesn't have to do with bedroom morality which is what usually gets conservatives who want to force you to be good going br br and that's the problem with the film al gore is a politician and a very successful one at that he just can't help himself from appealing to those people who want to force others to do as they would the political appeal is just too great br br and there we are left with a scientific issue that may be of huge importance reduced to a political issue appealing to those in the body politic with a predilection to force other to do right br br another interesting question is how did the environmental movement get hijacked by such people
spoilers br br i wasn't sure what to think of the movie not too much of a kids film definately should be watched with a parent because it includes death and dying but i was surprised that i was a bit entertained by it br br i was a bit disappointed by the 81 minutes of time we had even less without the credits and the trailer gets you to think the rodent is a main creature but alas they torture him right until the end of the movie those two gripes docked the movie 2 stars but i do recommend the movie even for a sequel br br 8 10 br br quality 9 10 entertainment 7 10 replayable 7 10
this isn't among jimmy stewart's best films i'm quick to admit that however while some view his film as pure propaganda i'm wondering what's so wrong with that yes sure like the tv show the fbi this is an obvious case of the bureau doing some pr work to try to drum up support but as entertainment goes it does a good job plus surprisingly enough for the time it was made the film focuses more on crime than espionage and commies instead it's a fictionalization of one of the earliest agents and the career he chose now considering the agent is played by jimmy stewart then it's pretty certain the acting and writing were good as this was a movie with a real budget and a studio who wasn't about to waste the star in a third rate flick so overall it's worth seeing but not especially great
ok first of all ignore the last person' review they admit to falling asleep through it so it's no wonder they didn't understand what was going on as thriller horrors go this film ain't too bad it is certainly very watchable right from the opening scenes you get a general idea exactly what is going to be the cause of all the craziness that follows and come the end you are proved right with everything being made clear br br i enjoyed this movie it was quite eerie at times and as old films go it was passable great to watch late at night i give it a generous 7 out of 10
i waited until the 4th of july to write this because well because it just feels right to be doing it on this day br br in 1924 d w griffith needed a hit he had not had a big one since orphans of the storm 1921 he'd been working steadily since then but his movies had been smaller in scope and had failed to hit the right chord with audiences he was planning a film about patrick henry when he was contacted by members of the daughters of the american revolution dar who asked if he might expand his ideas to encompass more of the american revolution this movie is the result by the time he had finished he had a 14 reel history lesson and there wasn't a trace of patrick henry anywhere br br we all know the story of the revolutionary war but griffith threw in a love story with patriot farmer nathan neil hamilton falling in love with tory aristocrat nancy montague carol dempster a leading lady for griffith for many years complicating matters is the fact that nancy's father hates nathan well not just nathan he hates all rebels it does not help matters when during a skirmish on the streets of lexington someone jostles nathan's arm causing him to discharge his gun and accidentally wound nancy's dad br br paralelling the love story is the mostly true but partially embellished story of capt walter butler lionel barrymore a renegade british officer who feels he owes allegiance to no one with thousands of indians form the six nations on his side he hopes to crush the colonials and become monarch of his own empire br br comparisons with birth of a nation 1915 are inevitable the montague family might just as well be the cameron's from the earlier film while nathan could be a part of the stoneman family the sequence of the battle of bunker hill is staged very similarly to a scene in birth of a nation with the attacking army in this case the redcoats storming a trench packed with patriots the only thing missing is henry walthall charging across no man's land to stuff a flag into the muzzle of a cannon amazingly enough the battle scenes in america seem to lack the energy of the battle scenes in birth and fail to draw the audience in something is clearly missing it isn't scope g w billy bitzer's camera work is quite good maybe what is missing is dare i say it sincerity br br the brutality of capt butler and his men is well underscored although much of it happens in long shot or offscreen don't expect any heads to be lopped off in closeup like we saw in intolerance 1916 in one scene butler's second in command capt hare louis wolhiem gouges out the eyes of a captive colonist we see only the beginning of the deed for the remainder the camera focuses on hare's face as he obviously has a good time doing this lionel had been working with griffith on and off since 1912 a story goes that he approached griffith for work and d w knowing the reputation of his famous family said i am not hiring stage actors to which lionel replied and i am nothing of the kind sir he makes a very good and quite believable villain louis wolhiem appeared with lionel's older brother john three times in sherlock holmes and dr jekyll and mr hyde both 1920 and later in the tempest 1927 as capt hare his wild staring eyes and disheveled hair not only mark him as a villain but make you think he is quite mad also br br neil hamilton later remarked that america was his first time on horseback and i was scared to death he hides his displeasure very well though and we can believe he was quite the equestrian by the time shooting was over mr griffith was very much in love with carol dempster and at one point asked her to marry him she refused and soon left his stock company after which her star status gradually waned br br speaking of horses one accidentally amusing moment which had to be unscripted came during the depiction of paul revere's ride he rides his horse right up on the front porch of a family to announce to arms the regulars are coming but as he tries to leave the horse cannot negotiate the steps backwards and stumbles spilling his rider on the ground i am amazed griffith did not do another take br br so is america a classic yes don't wait for july 4th to see it it is enjoyable anytime
disney has now made straight to video sequels to a good bunch of their many animated features two of these were made for their 1991 classic beauty and the beast well these ones aren't really sequels as they are both set in between the events of the first film the first of these two straight to video films was beauty and the beast the enchanted christmas which seems to be disliked by quite a few fans of its theatrical predecessor but i think that can usually be expected with sequels however this second one belle's magical world is definitely inferior br br the film features three short stories all of which take place while belle is in the castle and the place is under the spell of the enchantress the first is the perfect word where a misunderstanding at the table between belle and the beast leads to trouble and neither wants to be the first to apologize the next story is fifi's folly where fifi and lumiere's fifth anniversary is coming up and lumiere is unprepared so belle helps him however fifi sees lumiere practicing romance with belle and thinks they're actually in love the film ends with the broken wing in this story belle takes care of a bird with a broken wing but a bird in the castle will probably mean trouble if the beast finds out as he hates birds br br the plot description i gave is for the original vhs version of disney's third beauty and the beast movie apparently in the dvd version there is another story added called mrs potts's party but i've only seen the original version however since i highly doubt that one story would stand out as a classic over the rest i see no point in watching the special edition anyway the first thing i will say about belle's magical world is that the animation is very 2 dimensional compared to what we're used to from disney which would obviously disappoint many people i didn't like beauty and the beast the enchanted christmas that much but you certainly can't say the same about its animation i'm sure the stories in belle's magical world could entertain many kids mostly younger ones i think and each story has a moral so they could also teach them some valuable lessons however for adults the film really doesn't have a lot i personally didn't find any good humour in it found that the constant conflict between belle and the beast got tiring and the stories did not impress me too much at all in any way they're not very well written in the perfect word the way belle says to the beast you're acting rude and foolish is a bit cheesy and i think there are quite a few other cheesy moments in these stories br br by the time this straight to video movie first came out i was around eleven or twelve years old i don't know what i would have thought of it at the time as i had lost interest in disney by then and it would be years before i would gain any of that interest back even when this movie was first released i think i was a bit past the age group it was aimed at i never saw beauty and the beast the enchanted christmas until a couple months ago but unlike that film i never even heard of this one until recently i think just after seeing the first sequel to disney's 1991 hit well as much as i like the theatrical original i wouldn't have been missing much if i never became aware of this film's existence for little kids i'm sure belle's magical world can be highly entertaining and probably somewhat educational with its morals but i do not recommend it for adult disney fans
the only thing about this film that bums me out is that the dvd is so expensive it's too much for my budget at the moment or i would purchase it because the film is a good example of film noir and i enjoy watching richard widmark jean peters and thelma ritter br br criterion produces great dvds but sometimes the asking price is just a bit much that's the case here for an 80 minute black and white mono sound film that is good but nothing extraordinary cinematography wise br br the story is the story here as opposed to visuals actors sound sets etc as a pickpocket widmark inadvertently winds up with espionage microfilm in his possession after pilfering peters' purse say that three times everyone but peters is a believable character in this movie widmark the cops the u s agents and the communists and especially ritter as moe an informant she and widmark are the stars of this film br br peters does a decent job of playing the cheap floozy but loses her credibility early on by falling in love with widmark on the first meeting even though he's nasty to her only in world of film too bad because that ludicrous romance part of the story takes away from it br br this an average film noir which means good but not great and certainly not worth owning at a price of 25 35 for that price one could do a lot better in the film noir market
just about everything in this movie is wrong wrong wrong take mike myers for example he's reached the point where you realize that his shtick hasn't changed since his snl days over ten years ago he's doing the same cutesy stream of consciousness jokes and the same voices his cat is painfully unfunny he tries way to hard he's some weird type a comedian not the cool cat he's supposed to be the rest of the movie is just as bad the sets are unbelievably ugly and clearly a waste of millions of dollars cardboard cut outs for the background buildings would have made more sense than constructing an entire neighborhood and main street alec balwin tries to do a funny great santini impression but he ends up looking and sounding incoherent there's even an innapropriate cheesecake moment with faux celebrity paris hilton that sticks in the mind simply because this is supposed to be a dr seuss story avoid this movie at all costs folks it's not even an interesting train wreck i hope they'll make horton hears a who with robin williams then we'll have the bad seuss movie starring spasitc comedian trilogy
kay pollack the man behind this movie is a real great man who tries to share his life philosophy in different ways he has written a bunch of good and well written books about how to control your senses and keep your soul happy the message in most of his books and this movie is about that your thoughts in fact is what causes your problems and that the reason of your anger hardly ever is caused of what you think of the main message is that you can choose to be happy but hardly ever do that br br to watch this movie and learn something very important on life you have to keep your mind very open and l i s t e n to all the hidden messages or guidelines to get through life which most of the parts in this movie contains if you listen and watch watch it with your ears br br you won't learn the meaning of life but you'll learn how to live and get the most out of it br br so while watching please keep in mind br br the mind is like a parachute it doesn't work unless it's open
i was about 7 when this dire monstrosity of a film was released in the uk it was advertised on the tv in the summer of 1977 for weeks as if it were some incredible blockbuster film it was actually the first film i ever saw at a cinema and i was put off going for years to come the following week i was invited to go and see the new film star wars and i declined to this day i have never seen it in protest at having to watch sasquatch seriously even at the age of 7 i could tell that i was watching garbage it's just so bad it's almost unbelievable rambling nonsense that should never have made it to a cinema i was however amused to read all these years later that the director never directed again just as well as far as i'm concerned avoid at all costs
pop quiz you're a part of the modern armed forces in peacetime on routine manoeuvres and you find yourself thrown back in time with a chance to change history what do you do well if you're a hollywood studio you change the japanese g i s in g i samurai aka timeslip to the crew of an american aircraft carrier have them debate stopping the attack on pearl harbour for 90 minutes and then go home and hope that no one reminds you that japan did it first and with more balls in 1979 with this sonny chiba movie but unlike its hollywood counterpart the final countdown this sees its premise through thrown back 400 years into the japanese feudal wars its peacetime soldiers decide that their best hope of getting back lies in provoking history by trying to change it by joining with a warlord to conquer the country  cue lots of tank and helicopter vs samurai action including a very impressive unrelenting 25 minute battle sequence featuring a cast of thousands inflicting serious damage on each other and yes there are decapitations br br of course things don't go as planned and even superior firepower doesn't stand up as well as hoped to thousands of soldiers even before that the soldiers are falling out with each other into those who want to go home those who want to go to war and those who want to rape and pillage for the hell of it impressively directed and surprisingly well thought through the soft rock and country and western songs are sometimes a distraction especially when they feature english lyrics sung by japanese singers who audibly can't pronounce the words let alone speak the language but it's a forgivable flaw in a surprisingly good sci fi actioner br br optimum's uk dvd is a good transfer of the uncut 138 minute version
all hype what better way to describe a movie about people who are upset because they can't release their film through a mainstream distributor consequently they do it themselves otherwise the hype of the film doesn't justify the content in the film the story is absent and could easily be a short the acting is poor but the animation and music is pretty good otherwise don't waste your time don't believe the hype however if you have the chance to see the film for free do so then you won't have to waste money still the filmmakers do a good job of pressing their story and creating cliffhangers with their self indulgent mini series otherwise they're one hit wonders who never had a hit

in the first howling we are introduced to a world where werewolves exist and are somewhat organized the plot in that film made some sense a tv reporter investigates this and attempts to uncover the truth she ends up having to kill many of them including her boyfriend who becomes one then she shows the world that they do exist by transforming on live tv the special effects were just laughable in the first movie and they don't get any better in this one whether it's the transformations or the bad puppets or the cheesy computer graphics showing the superpowers br br the plot line isn't all that bad they must kill the leader of the werewolves for some reason this won't destroy all werewolves and it really doesn't end the threat from werewolves as it they just want to kill her i think there was some cloudy reason for this but it really gets lost in the film br br after the film ends we have a 10 minute montauge of the movie we just watched and every other scene is one where the female werewolf leader rips off her top exposing her large breasts while some devo esquire band plays to a crowd of werewolves br br the only thing that makes this movie even watchable is christopher lee
there are no spoilers in this review because everything was already shown in the movie's trailer i am trying to be balanced in my review because i strongly support local movies but i can't help but support the backlash against this movie it is slow boring and bordering on pointless even the almost nice and believable moments were immediately undercut by painful clichés and bad acting vernetta lopez and wong li lin whom i usually love were only passable in this movie it felt like the director was trying to make a melodramatic tv soap then got carried away and decided to put it on the big screen the leap years should come with an ra rating rated awful but it hasn't changed my faith in local movies more good films will come so long as more films like these don't get made
i actually quite enjoyed this show even as a youngster i was interested in all sports and that included horse racing it was always going to be difficult to make a series based on racing corruption and at the same time get permission from the race tracks to record filming about this controversial subject one episode i particularly remember centred around a horse expected to win a big race that looked a bit off colour a syringe was found on the stable floor and everyone thought it had been drugged but nothing showed up in the blood tests all too late they realised the horse hadnt been doped but had had its knee cartilage removed like running a car with no oil and the engine seizing up the horse broke down with tragic consequences
felt mine was while watching this but it seems that is the reason for insanity running in the family in this film not that makes a lot of sense anyway as others have mentioned this was one of karloff's last films and it's only his screen presence that lends it any credibility at all it's sad that all of the great legends of the horror films in the sound era were eventually reduced to starring in low grade rubbish like this marginally boris did get off slightly better than poor old bela lugosi but not by much br br boris does his best and give him credit for trying to hold this mess together the strident background music doesn't help and distracts from any lucid moment apart from boris the rest of the mexican cast are dubbed into some strange clipped english monotone that is reminiscent of the type used in porn films of the late seventies br br at a guess i think it's edgar allen poe's 'house of usher' that this is taken from but you'd be hard pressed to find a great deal of poe in the finished article br br still there are far better films out there with boris karloff at his best search them out and give this a wide berth unless you want the curse of the 'shrinking brain' too
trapped buried alive brings us to a resort that has just opened and is soon to close br br we start with a guy in gear blowing up drifts to avoid the possibility of avalanches somehow that doesn't make sense anyways he's about to blow away one particularly big one when he notices the resort is open despite his best efforts higher authority tells him his day is over br br soon as everyone expects an avalanche hits br br look i'm not gonna reveal any more all i can say is this was a b movie designed for the family channel which i just saw it on and the fact it had no commercials proves it's a b movie anyways it's a pretty decent film but it's partially unreal br br firsthand when people are buried by ice and snow they're buried not just traced by powder or what about a cd for a screwdriver it's not possible and finally what i can't stress enough is that an explosion cannot stop a avalanche guaranteed br br furthermore it's worth a rental or a tv viewing but not owning 7 10 br br the movie is rated pg but maybe it should have received something a little more strong a boy nearly loses his foot in an elevator but his leg is cut around the ankle a guy is toasted by electricity and diesel and in the weight room dead people are laying around br br enjoy
nightmare weekend is proof positive that some people are so desperate to be 'in the movies' they are prepared to do almost anything br br i'm not referring to the countless women who seem quite happy to appear completely starkers in this dreadful piece of trash after all the naked female form is a beautiful thing and nothing to be ashamed of no i'm talking about those who are more than willing to co star with a badly made hand puppet called george now that is embarrassing br br a bio electronic being created by brilliant scientist edward brake wellington meffert george who looks like a demented felt clown with green wool for hair is the artificially intelligent interface for an advanced computer system that operates a revolutionary device a silver sphere about the size of a golf ball that when ingested can reverse character disorders br br edward's personality altering experiments have been successful on lab animals but the cautious scientist is reluctant to carry out tests on human subjects fearing that there may still be side effects his evil assistant julie debbie laster however has no such qualms and proceeds to use three beautiful young women as guinea pigs inevitably they all turn into hideous killer mutants br br with bargain basement special effects a cast totally devoid of talent and a plot that is almost impossible to follow i took notes as i watched the film and even then i am not entirely convinced that my synopsis is accurate nightmare weekend is a complete and utter disaster that not even several soft core sex scenes and a touch of gore can rescue br br this film also features one of the most irritating characters i have ever seen in a horror movie tony bruce morton a walkman wearing idiot who bops away to crap 80s music in a manner that makes me look like justin timberlake in comparison
this is one of the most atrocious rewrites i've ever viewed if they want to make a movie with a lousy story they should refrain from giving it a title of a fine book there is hardly a relation between wolfe's book and this movie other than the title i don't mind changes if they help a story flow on screen at least the changes shouldn't hurt the final product the last scene in the movie is painfully unconvincing the actors are miscast the director and or screen writer obviously could not decide whether to make a lame comedy or preach an unconvincing sermon br br if you've seen this movie and disliked it try the book if you've seen this movie and liked it read the book
back in my days as an usher private lessons played at the 4 plex i was working it was a sleeper hit selling out friday and saturday nights for several weeks i never got around to seeing it but saw that it was on cable this last weekend so i decided to give it a shot what i witnessed for the next 90 minutes was one of the worst movies i have ever seen and one that made me terribly uncomfortable to watch br br the basic story is a teenage boy lusts after his sexy maid sylvia kristel she too seems to feel an attraction towards the boy but for more sinister reasons so we get scenes of the boy watching her undress and her inviting him in to watch and it goes from there br br eric brown as the teenage boy has to be one of the worst actors i have ever seen his scared reactions to every time sylvia takes off a piece of clothing or when she touches him are horrible i didn't laugh a single time during this piece of junk br br and let's not get started on the subplot of the maid and chauffeur planning to extort money from the kid let's just say it involves faking a death burying a body i could go on and on but it gets more ridiculous br br the sex scenes are the worst i have ever seen even though eric brown was older then he looked the fact is he looks like a baby it appears he has no idea how to kiss a woman if that was acting then maybe i should re think my criticisms of brown and it just came too close to bordering on child pornography to be erotic i have never been so turned off by a sex scene even though miss kristel is quite beautiful with and without clothes br br spoiler warning i must make mention of the last scene to me it's just plain sick but i can remember audiences cheering as the film freeze framed and dissolved into credits our hero returns to school and begins a flirtation with one of the female teachers he asks her out for dinner and she gives him a look as if tom cruise has just asked her out she nods affirmatively and he walks away smiling at the camera in triumph give me a break yes i am sure teachers all over would just risk everything for a plain looking teenage kid br br i will never understand the appeal this film had in 1982 certainly it was more then the nudity because there were plenty of teen sex comedies with nudity that bombed at the box office and to think that these same teenagers that cheered that movie 22 years ago are now working their way up corporate ladders and possibly helping to run this country that is a scary thought
hey everybody i've got an idea we found this egg shaped thingie from outer space so why don't we thaw it out and open it up yes i know that would be the dumbest thing a scientist could do and it could be filled with contaminating bacteria or viruses unknown to earth and could potentially wipe out the human race but hey i want to know what's in it and nobody tell nasa they might take it away from us wow this thingie gives off vibes yes really strong ones on contact so don't touch it but it's okay to cut it open hi there handsome check out my nips later that day do not open uh oh we have to run all the way to the lab and tell them not to open it because we don't have phones or radios or intercoms even though we have a gazillion dollars worth of other equipment here i've never seen such organic technology yeah lemme take this stick and stab it i'm getting out of here i don't care if i do kill the other 6 billion people on earth nobody's nukkin' me look it's the friendly aliens from the abyss they want us to come with them the end
the internet database lists this as a tv show and yes it was a series on mtv shown on the oddities program after the head and before aeon flux if i recall correctly but the version i watched this time was a vhs tape with all the episodes run together into a film without annoying credits in between or having to wait a week for the next fifteen minutes br br you have the story of the maxx julie winters sarah and mr gone the maxx is a super hero or a bum julie a social worker or a leopard queen sarah a girl who should listen to less of the smiths and mr gone a guy who can't seem to keep his head on and then there's the other weird creatures br br i use or with maxx and julie because part of the fun is trying to figure out which parts of the story are real and which are dreams maybe they're all real or dreams maybe one of the characters doesn't exist maybe only one exists and dreams of the others you'll have to wait and find out br br i had the comic books before the show came out and it was one of my favorites the artwork was spectacular and the story was original unlike anything you'll find in superman or batman it will bend your mind and has strong adult overtones without being obscene or offensive and the show used basically the same exact artwork only now it moves and the same story guaranteeing that the beauty intrinsically found in the comic would be faithfully reproduced this was the best show to appear on oddities hands down br br if you like comics of a darker nature or need a good mind trip this is a show to check out it's donnie darko before there was ever such a thing br br the most astonishing thing is that this never went on to become another movie or television series but i don't say this in disappointment by keeping it simple they have sealed this movie in gold and kept it free from the blemishes brought on by successive failures
i have made it my personal mission to go after those responsible for this film i even got the rental company to give me my money back because i argued that they perpetrated false advertising br br it's not enough that the movie itself is a p o s but the cover art is what sold me i've done better make up effects on my children at halloween than what the movie actually depicts versus the cover art can you say raccoon eyes br br i'm not going to waste more of my time by going into the full details but come on the movie's main character is an l a cop who was born and raised in alabama but has a german accent it's beyond insulting
teamo supremo are three kids consisting of their leader captain crandall rope girl and skate lad all with their own battlecry buza chika woopa and outfit and moves they work for the governor kevin and were recruited after wishing to be heroes and playing at that game they lead normal lives as well and have family and school duties but most of the action takes place away from school fighting villains the villains all have rather unique and singular traits such as mister vague and his men who never seem to know what their plans are but act anyway from an evil robot to a wicked baron the three have to encounter them and stop their evil and often strange plans to gain power take revenge etc br br the animation itself is quite nice and smooth but the style appears to be simple on purpose the backgrounds have overlapping colour and the buildings seem futuristic the music is quite nice and the show isn't too bad altogether although the style isn't my favourite br br the plots are almost always nonsensical and ridiculous but after all this is a cartoon and one can't blame them for that however this would not be in the same rank as fillmore or pepper ann
many of the criticisms on this thread seem to pick a comparison of this film with the mortal storm or casablanca everyone is entitled to compare films they choose but the similarities of the mortal storm and watch on the rhine are clearly the problems of refugees threatened by the nazi juggernaut while the main comparative point brought out with casablanca is the seeming unjust treatment of humphrey bogart in 1943 by the academy of motion picture arts and science because they chose paul lukas instead for the best actor oscar it does not strike me as totally wrong lukas had a good career in film both here and in england he is the villain in the lady vanishes and this performance was his best one bogart had more great performances in him than rick blaine for instance he was ignored for sam spade in the maltese falcon and roy earle in high sierra two years earlier both of which were first rate performances and he would not get an oscar for his greatest performances as fred c dobbs in the treasure of sierra madres the writer murder suspect in in a lonely place and captain philip francis queeg in the caine mutiny afterward he got it for charley in the african queen i think that bogie should have got it for the role of dobbs but it did not happen but lukas was lucky he got it on the defining performance of his lesser career few can claim that br br to me the film to look at with watch on the rhine is based on another play script by hellman the searching wind they both look at america's spirit of isolationism in the 1920s and 1930s the searching wind is really looking at the whole inter war period while watch on the rhine set in the years just proceeding our entry into world war ii deals with a few weeks of time therefore it is better constructed as a play and more meaningful for it's impact br br the film has many good performances led by lukas as the exhausted but determined anti nazi fighter courier davis as his loyal wife wisely keeping her character as low keyed as possible due to lukas being the center of the play's activities coulouris as the selfish conniving but ultimately foolish and ineffective teck lucille watson as the mother of davis and geraldine fitzgerald as coulouris' wiser and sadder and fed up wife and kurt katch who delivers a devastating critique as the local embassy's gestapo chief about coulouris and others who would deal with the nazis it has dialog with bite in it and what it says is quite true it also has moments of near poetry witness the scene towards the end when coulouris is left alone with lukas and davis and says the new world has left the scene to the old world hellman could write very well at times br br given the strength of the film script and performances i would rate this film highly among world war ii films

oh dear oh dear br br for jm fans this was the nail in the coffin as far as her a list hollywood career was concerned after solid turns in girl can't help it wayward bus the burglar and rock hunter it seemed jayne was well on the way to becoming one of tinsel town's hottest stars however an obsession with racy publicity and an appearance in this clunker relegated mansfield to the sidelines namely cheap euro loan outs until fox could drop her contract at the earliest opportunity br br this movie really is a diabolical waste of everyone's time with the exception of suzy parker who is the only thing in this movie bad enough for the material many people blame poor jayne and her grating performance for this film's poor returns at the box office and while she is a pain in this film she can only do her best with the material after all cary hardly sets the screen on fire does he after a handful of very good dramatic and comedy turns jayne takes 10 steps back in her pursuit as a serious actress by agreeing simply for the sake of appearing with grant to portray this squealing idiotic menace her character of alice is a complete cartoon bimbo and although she looks good enough to eat in a boiler suit her every appearance in the film jangles your nerves we all know jayne could do so much better than this dross and yet here she is parading around like a prize pudding a real shame br br steer clear of this so called comedy it's more depressing than funny
even though the plot was very well detailed and the story line was understandable the fact that steven seagals voice was dubbed with some one else's through out most of the movie was distressing as you were unsure who was talking there were many parts where he would start to talk in his deep raspy voice and then the next some one else's voice was doing the talking for him i don't know the reason however if he had difficulty with his voice during production of the movie i think they could have re shot the events that did not contain his own voice when he had recovered i have rated this movie 3 out of 10 based on the quality of the film when one pays for a movie whether or not its at the theater or on dvd this movie was not worth the admission price that was charged i have been a long time follower of steven seagal and all his movies that he has done over the past years to date i think this is one of the worst ones we have seen yet
after an initial release of 4 very good eurotrash titles redemption has managed to scrape the bottom of the barrel with the bloodsucker leads the dance i found no bloodsuckers anywhere in this movie br br the story is simple a mysterious count invites several actresses to his castle for a little vacation after some sofcore sexual shenanigans the girls get decapitated one by one who is the killer who knows there are more red herrings in this one than at the local fish market on friday br br the pace is excruciating the story is silly and the skin scenes aren't all that terrific either br br give this one a miss
woosh man what can i say br br the opening scene maybe we see a bunch of mongoloid barbarians with bad make up jump off the walls of some ruins they sneak around and attack some dude with a scantily clothed captive girl the dude runs off the mongoloids follow him and one of them stays behind seemingly to rape the girl but instead he exposes one of her breasts and kidnaps her then the dude still on the run sees a horse and tries to steal it suddenly a blond god like looking hero with a bad wig appears saying that's my horse the mighty deathstalker just made his appearance the mongoloids arrive deathstalker kills all of them including the dude on the tunes of some rather inappropriate mexicanos western score this is supposed to be a swords sorcery flick so what's with the 'arriba trompettos' and then goes up to captive girl and exposes both her breasts he starts to rub them and captive girl seems to like it she starts liking her lips and caressing deathstalker just when they are about to get down to it this old dude appears interrupting what could have been the end of a perfect day for deathstalker and a possible perfect ending for a short film br br now tell me isn't that the point where either a feminist would angrily switch off the movie or any other male viewer would say this is going to be one hell of a good movie the plot is as simple as throwing a kitten from the balcony deathstalker must obtain the sword of justice and use it to steal the amulet of life and the chalice of magic from the evil sorcerer munkar br br aside from decapitations dismemberment random bloodshed retarded fist fights and embarrassing sword fights this film also contains a massive amount of t ts a shots i initially wanted to add one extra point to this movie for each gratuitous shot of naked boobies i could count after 9 points not even halfway into the movie i had to give up counting it was distracting me from the rest of the movie and the rest of the movie was worth it totally crazy stuff check out this mutant cat worm like creature munkar has as a pet and which he feeds eyeballs and fingers and here's an interesting question what would you do if a man in a woman's body would enter your bedroom and try to kill you with a knife the answer is simple you slap him around a bit take away the knife and then try to rape him then you discover that he's actually not a woman so you throw him out of your bed and tell him to leave your room it works out well i tell you deathstalker does it too and the deathstalker way is the right way br br deathstalker is a wonderful movie really as pointed out in other comments the villains are vile the women are delicious there's blood sex violence rape and tasty chicken there's a completely pointless tournament which just features a bunch of barbarians beating slashing and hacking the crap out of each other my favorite weapon used in that tournament was a giant wooden hammer used to beat a poor contender to bloody pulp and my favorite contender undoubtedly was that one brute with the warthog head reminiscent of the gamorrean guards from return of the jedi i won't reveal how the movie ends but just prepare to ravish in delight when i tell you a 4 way dismemberment is thrown into the movie's climax br br and of course there's a wonderful display of ineptitude throughout the whole movie see a guy being dragged behind a horse over a dirt road and the next point of view shot shows him being dragged over grass no road see that awesome tattoo on the sorcerer's head magically change sides within the same scene on shot has it on the left side of his head the other on the right well after all munkar is a magician it's that or this movie was shot in an alternate universe where things like continuity simply don't exist br br as much as i enjoyed this and as much as i am looking forward to the other 3 installments in this series i do have enough shreds of decency left in me to not let this movie pass i am prepared though to give it the maximum amount of minimal points just so i could be able to deduct a couple of more points for the possibly inferior sequels to follow deathstalker might be a superbly fun trashy sleazy conan rip off it also is an abominable movie
i had really only been exposed to olivier's dramatic performances and those were mostly much later films than divorce in this film he is disarmed of his pomp and overconfidence by sassy merle oberon and plays the flustered divorce attorney with great charm
i usually don't walk out of a movie but halfway thru i did this movie promised something different but i kept thinking haven't i seen that before spoiler alert back in 1 the spaceship crashes and lands on earth well all these years later with a super adult on board no less this thing still manages to burn up and crash what this advanced civilization can't seem to develop landing gear for an industry that's so liberal we get to see another woody allen movie no blacks please superman runs around saving people making sure he sticks to europe and the us don't go into darkie areas please maybe i could stomach this about 30 years ago but now now
the line is funnier in england where away from vixen 's native america the word fanny has a whole new meaning sadly it's the only laugh you'll get in this terrible sex comedy that is neither sexy nor funny br br oddly unalluring with painted on eyebrows erica gavin acting ability zero is a nymphomaniac who lusts after her own brother but rejects his black friend while making derogatory remarks about watermelons as if in revenge he asks her if she would go with a shetland pony reference is also made to making it with monkeys gavin's ability to shake and tremble with orgasmic pleasure at the slightest touch is matched only in it's lack of appeal by her seduction dance  which involves a bonfire and a haddock personally i preferred the haddock br br for '68 this was pretty tame stuff and belies the controversy it attracted at the time a character claims to be getting stoned though it's only on bourbon and for one of the original x certificates there's no full frontal nudity just six years later we would be getting timmy lea and his confessions but here we have to make do with topless shots only gavin's final seduction of her own brother really shocks another activity for vixen is where she helps settle the sexual problems between a married couple by sleeping with them both the two women clearly aren't enjoying acting out their scene together and make a poor effort to disguise it after vixen irons out their disharmony the romantic husband concludes of his wife i guess she's got it coming to her br br the only near worthwhile segment involves an unusual discussion of cuban communism it seems out of place with the rest of the film though is spliced with shots of gavin's breasts to rope it in to continuity this then leads into a vague anti vietnam stance which is commendable though dropped in the middle of such a frivolous film it seems trite and insensitive not to say downright tasteless incidentally the part of would be communist niles brooke is taken by harrison page the same harrison page who played captain trunk in amusing comedy sledge hammer page must be embarrassed by his back catalogue which also includes meyer's beyond the valley of the dolls though meyer apologists would have you believe the terrible dialogue lousy acting sloppy direction and dire editing are not just part of the charm but wholly intentional as a defence it fails to hold water br br the irritating incidental music  a cross between the tunes they play in cinema restaurant ads and muzak used by tv stations when the transmission breaks down  is omnipresent and intrusive while even the silly amateurishly skewed camera angles can't generate interest a wonderful world of jazz saxophones where women have been asking for it black men  or shines  aren't good enough for anyone and rape is an acceptable form of revenge absolutely abysmal
a prison cell four prisoners carrere a young company director accused of fraud 35 year old transsexual in the process of his transformation daisy a 20 year old mentally challenged idiot savant and lassalle a 60 year old intellectual who murdered his wife behind a stone slab in the cell mysteriously pulled loose they discovered a book the diary of a former prisoner danvers who occupied the cell at the beginning of the century the diary contains magic formulas that supposedly enable prisoners to escape malefique is one of the creepiest and most intelligent horror films i have seen this year the film has a grimy shadowy feel influenced by the works of h p lovecraft which makes for a very creepy and unsettling atmosphere there is a fair amount of gore involved with some imaginative and brutal death scenes and the characters of four prisoners are surprisingly well developed it's a shame that eric valette made truly horrible remake of one missed call after his stunning debut 9 out of 10
when my own child is begging me to leave the opening show of this film i know it is bad i wanted to claw my eyes out i wanted to reach through the screen and slap mike myers for sacrificing the last shred of dignity he had this is one of the few films in my life i have watched and immediately wished to unwatch if only it were possible the other films being 'troll 2' and 'fast and furious' both which are better than this crap in the hat br br i may drink myself to sleep tonight in a vain attempt to forget i ever witnessed this blasphemy on the good seuss name br br to mike myers i say stick with austin or even resurrect waynes world just because it worked for jim carrey doesn't mean seuss is a success for all canadians br br
lame cliched superhero action movie drivel i had high hopes for this movie and the genre of hk buddy cop actioneers is one that i don't despise but very rarely do i see a storyline as trite and ludicrous as this one was this would have been forgivable as it always is in these kinds of movies when the action compensates unfortunately it did not the action does carry the trademark surreality and over the top nature of hk action but it's not very involving obscenely gory and in fact often completely incoherent perhaps this is due to re editing for american release it does show signs in many places of patchwork i was very disappointed
as i work at a video store i found it to be my solemn duty to talk about the worst movies i've ever seen and warn my friends and co workers of it amidst one day of particularly heated debate of what is the worst movie my friend dared me to watch b t k killer even stating that if i could watch the whole movie and still claim my previous choice was the worst movie ever then he'd watch it i lost i believe that even i made better videos than this in high school and those were hardly great feats of a young genius this film not only lacked in what seemed to be production value it looks like it was shot on a bad camcorder although it is surprisingly clear but also in acting wooden hollow and pathetic don't scratch the surface as well as just generally bad movie feeling i can remember a scene where i heard glass smash suddenly i was reminded of some bad high school plays i know that i reference high school too often here but this film did seem very juvenile both in terms of the set which seemed far too fake but also as if the people were reading their lines from the script not entirely sure what was actually going on my review doesn't do this film justice because i can't describe how utterly horrid the time i spent watching this was it's almost ironic that i do a pathetic job describing a pathetic excuse for a movie
i am never a big fan of taiwan movie production as opposed to korean hongkong or even china strong acting quality is hardly found in them as clearly shown in this film i don't consider myself as hard to please audience as i am in fact a fan of indie movies however this movie shows weak plot and slow pace i found myself lost in the middle as to where the plot is going the acting certainly does not make it better rainie's acting is sub par as she 'over act' trying to be perky and cute although i have to admit she is a pleasure to look at isabella leong on the other hand plays a more suitable role as a confused sad regretful extremely reserved character overall i find this movie is a disappointment
i was fortunate enough to meet george pal and still have my ds tmob poster autographed by him at a convention shortly after the release and asked him why he chose to do the film camp before he could answer two studio flacks intercepted and lectured me on how the studio knew best and how no one will take such a film seriously i had been reading the bantam reprints for a couple of years thanks to a friend comicon attendees of the 1970s will recall blackhawk and his band i was in a couple of years of that with him and had higher hopes than what we got br br the flacks insisted that no high adventure would ever be done seriously and so doing 'camp' was the only way several other fans jumped in on my side with pal listening as best he could at the end of the little event pal came up to us and apologized wishing he could have done more and better br br star wars put the lie to the flacks and a year after pal's death spielberg and lucas proved that doc savage could have easily been the next major movie franchise if it hadn't been for the flacks br br tear out the memory or history of doc and the film would have been worth a 6 10 rating as nothing more than a mindless popcorn seller br br but destroying the legacy like that was no less an abomination than killing a baby in the crib br br doc savage can still come to the screen and survive the inevitable comparisons by the ill informed to indiana jones but it would have to be done in all seriousness and earnest to reclaim the glory that we should expect from the first american superhero br br sidenotes yes there was a second script for archenemy of evil and it's a lot more serious yes there was simultaneous footage shot but mostly establishing shots and very little with actors and yes there is a one sheet of ron ely leaping over a brick wall and blasting at something over his shoulder with a specially built bronze pistol ely's wearing a duster over a button down white shirt with a bronze tie and the words doc savage archenemy of evil coming next summer postscript if anyone knows who the studio flacks were that accompanied george pal in 1975 to san diego for the convention smack the idiots up the side of the head and call them the idiots that they are at the time they were doing dorkknobs and fu manchu in stripes and baggy canvas pants and carrying paramount portfolios
the fight scenes play like slow motion jackie chan and the attempts at wit are pathetic worst pun by far guess what this time i heard you coming the stars are a mismatched pair brandon lee despite the terrible lines he has to say actually shows traces of charisma and screen charm things that dolph lundgren is completely free of at least in this movie note to the director in the future please stay away from any love scenes especially when your main actress won't do any nudity and you have to rely extensively on a body double 1 2
this is another one of those 'humans vs insects eco horror' features a theme that was popular in the late 70's only you can't really call it horror there's zero suspense and no gruesome events in other words this movie is pretty lame it's not that it's really bad or something it's just very boring a construction site near a hotel uncovers a big nest of ants later on we learn that probably due to different sorts of pesticides used in the past their bite became poisonous some people get bitten and rushed to the hospital and it takes ages for the residents of the hospital to figure out what's going on robert foxworth figures it out first and then you can see him go berserk with a digging machine for what seems like several hours then they flee in the house waiting to get rescued and man you should see all the efforts they make for rescuing them i won't spoil too much but at one point they even use a big helicopter all the time when i was watching this i sat there thinking come on people you all got shoes on just run out of the building i'm sure a bunch of ants won't catch up with you it's all pretty ridiculous br br of course lots of close ups of crawling ants are shown throughout the whole movie ants in the garden ants in the garbage ants in the kitchen ants on the roof ants in the bedroom ants in the sink and the best part ants crawling on people's faces while the actors are breathing through straws but when you see groups of ants in wider shots they indeed look like black rice the set designers glued to the wall br br one small surprise came near the end no it has nothing to do with a twist in the plot it was just that brian dennehy made an appearance as a chief fireman ehrr what more can i say this movie is called it happened at lakewood manor but the box art of my copy read ants and the title during the opening credits was panic at lakewood manor there you have it now since this is a made for tv movie from the 70's i'll be once again extremely mild in my final rating now the savage bees another 'humans vs insects' tv movie from 1976 was much better than this one i even feel i have to go back and add a few points to its rating after having seen ants lacking suspense action thrills shocks and creepiness the only thing you'll be left with after seeing ants is an annoying itch
first what i didn't like the acting was not really up to the hamlet standard branagh was really over the top doing a lot of yelling mostly in my opinion those actors who were not big name celebrities generally did a better job though i would except billy crystal and robin williams and charlton heston too but i wasn't sure if he was playing at being a hack a lot of the ambiguities in the play were clearly resolved one way in the flashbacks br br what i think speaks very much in this play's favor is that it is accessible shakespeare is hard to understand for the vast majority of people nowadays many people are not even inclined to try because of its reputation as serious literature and its archaic english if they see this film they will understand clearly at least one man's interpretation of the play they will be seeing it more as shakespeare's audiences saw it a play with sword fights and battles and mighty kings and nobles murder and incest and evil schemes and ghosts and great art if one cares to look for it but in shakespeare's day most didn't any more than most people do now branagh's overacting and his forcing of his interpretation of the story on the viewer may detract from shakespeare's art somewhat but it is better that modern audiences get a piece of it rather than nothing br br i've got to say one more thing though some people are complaining that it's set in the 19th century and that wasn't shakespeare's time well in shakespeare's time their costume and scenery was that of their own day for all of their plays shakespeare may have said it's in the days of ancient rome or medieval denmark or whatever but he didn't dress his characters up like they were he used the costumes of his own time for the same reason his plays are full of anachronisms for example in king john the english and french have cannons in robin hood's day in julius caesar they talk of chimneys which wouldn't be invented for another thousand years and in henry iv they talk about machiavelli who wasn't even born yet then so i think this objection is silly you might as well complain that the play isn't in danish after all they live in denmark don't they
please see also my comment on die nibelungen part 1 siegfried br br the second part of ufa studio's gargantuan production of the nibelungen saga continues in the stylised symphonic and emotionally detached manner of its predecessor however whereas part one was a passionless portrayal of individual acts of heroism part two is a chaotic depiction of bloodletting on a grand scale br br as in part one director fritz lang maintains a continuous dynamic rhythm with the pace of the action and the complexity of the shot composition rising and falling smoothly as the tone of each scene demands these pictures should only be watched with the note perfect gottfried huppertz score which fortunately is on the kino dvd now with this focus on mass action lang is presented with greater challenges in staging the action sequences in his earliest features were often badly constructed but now he simply makes them part of that rhythmic flow with the level of activity on the screen swelling up like an orchestra br br but just as part one made us witness siegfried's adventures matter of factly and without excitement part two presents warfare as devastating tragedy in both pictures there is a deliberate lack of emotional connection with the characters that's why lang mostly keeps the camera outside of the action never allowing us to feel as if we are there and this is significant because involving the audience is normally a distinction of lang's work that's also why the performances are unnaturally theatrical with the actors lurching around like constipated sleepwalkers br br nevertheless kriemhild's revenge does constantly deal with emotions and is in fact profoundly humanist the one moment of naturalism is when atilla holds his baby son for the first time and lang actually emphasises the tenderness of this scene by building up to it with the wild frantic ride of the huns the point is that lang never manipulates us into taking sides and in that respect this version has more in common with the original saga than the wagner opera the climactic slaughter is the very antithesis of a rousing battle scene why then did hitler and co get so teary eyed over it a fact which has unfairly tarnished the reputation of these films because the unwavering racial ideology of the nazis made them automatically view the nibelungs as the good guys even if they do kill babies and betray their own kin for hitler their downfall would always be a nationalist tragedy not a human one br br but for us non nazi viewers what makes this picture enjoyable is its beautiful sense of pageantry and musical rhythm when you see these fully developed silent pictures of lang's it makes you realise how much he was wasted in hollywood rather than saddling him with low budget potboilers they should have put him to work on a few of those sword and sandal epics pictures that do not have to be believable and do not have to move us emotionally where it's the poetic operatic tonality that sweeps us along
with the amount of actors they have working on the project they have a wide variety of cast nice starship cgi in places but their green screen needs some work anyone heard of adobe after effects 7 they should buy it get their keying better br br stories are well thought out plenty of trek elements in this to keep it in the right context but but the idea of two guys kissing makes me wind forward the episode im not homophobic but i cant help that i don't find men kissing entertaining dont mind women anyway for a fan series this is good stuff with minor improvement in their green screen brush up acting and some guidance ratings this series is stunning anyway i recommend this series to who ever enjoyed tng and ds9
if mulder was looking for his real father here he is darren mcgavin the first x files pity it was only one season long the producers of this show didn't know that they had the makings of a classic on their hands and in 1993 along came chris carter with what i call the follow up to the night stalker the x files both will go down as classics is my opinion the two shows taking the viewers to a level of experience that only comes along once in a while and who should appear in the x files years later darren mcgavin as agent arthur dales helping our two favorite hero s solving cases paying homage to the man i think so well done chris carter bringing back a forgotten tv show in the form of david duchovny as darren mcgavin if it wasn't for watching the x files and that particular show i would have never known about the night stalker
this is a film that on the surface would seem to be all about j edgar hoover giving himself a a big pat on the back for fighting klansmen going after indian killers hunting the famous gangsters of the 1930's fighting nazi's in the us and south america during world war 2 and commies in new york during the early 1950's of course in 1959 we did not know about mr hoover's obsession for keeping secret files on honest americans bugging people like the rev martin luther king jr but worst of all his secret love affair with his deputy director clyde tolson if you want to know more about that subject i suggest seeing the film citizen cohn hoover aside this story of a life in the fbi as told by jimmy stewart makes for a decent but dated film vera miles as his devoted wife is also good but jimmy is the movie as much as hoover controlled production and always made sure the fbi was seen without fault jimmy stewart gave the film a human side quite an achievement considering hoover was always looking over his shoulder the background score is also pleasant i have read recent online articles suggesting that this is a forgotten film jimmy stewart was one of the greatest film stars of all time and none of his films should be forgotten tcm was the last network to show it a long time ago and i hope they show it again
ok so it may not be the award winning movie of the year type film apart from the brilliant soundtrack that i think won a few awards but it is a really great film about 'the kid' prince o take your pick and the happenings around him living in minneapolis playing his music the music is absolutely superb in my opinion you have to own this soundtrack it is truly a classic and sums up the eighties sounds and feel in a wonderful fashion and the movie itself plays out a nice plot it's worth seeing over and over again espeically if you like prince o which i do of course
i saw this on tv so long ago that i can't remember when it was but it still stands out as one of the scariest most unnerving films i've ever seen there is a simultaneously subtle but intense dread induced by the woman in black lurking at the edge of the frame not quite clearly visible so that you feel like the solicitor hero unsure whether its just imagination or not it is also one of the few films which has really made me fearful to keep watching production values be hanged good films are about a director's ability to create atmosphere using film actors locations sets music attention to detail and imagination a real gem
this movie is horrible if you pay attention to it it's a perfect movie if you just watch the colorful images dance across the screen each one with no apparent connection to the next i rented this movie because i'm a david bowie fan and i really appreciate musicals in finality bowie was in the film for a total of ten minutes and the songs and dance sequences were sparse and left something to be desired the moral of the story was really befuddling i couldn't tell if it was about racial issues in london in the 1950s or about not selling out for the first half of the movie i was chuckling at how cheesy it was but i liked the campiness of the no selling out message when blacks started being murdered i thought my tape had gotten messed up maybe i rented half of two different movies nope there was a keep britain white song and dance sequence i'm sorry but wwii is not something you can write a musical about at least not a musical that could conceivably be described as campy as i have several times in this review overall i'd say this movie could do a whole lot better if it made up its mind and cast better actors and put david bowie in it for longer goddammit my grade c
on the 28th of december 1895 in the grand café in paris film history was writing itself while louis lumière showed his short films all single shots to a paying audience 'la sortie des usines lumière' was the first film to be played and i wish i was there not only to see the film but also the reactions of the audience br br we start with closed doors of the lumière factory apparently since the image seems a photograph people thought they were just going to see a slide show not something they were hoping for but then the doors open and people are streaming out heading home first a lot of women then some men and one man on a bike with a big dog when they are all out the doors close again br br whether this is the first film or not some say 'l'arrivée d'un train à la ciotat' was the first film lumière recorded it is an impressive piece of early cinema being bored by this is close to impossible for multiple reasons one simple reason it is only fifty seconds long but also for people who normally only like the special effect films there must be something interesting here you don't get to see historical things like this every day
when i started watching fay grim i had no idea that it was a sequel to henry fool now the latter was not a movie that i envisioned as having a sequel but one has arrived and it's quite good i assume that you've seen the original so i won't explain it this one starts with fay parker posey living with her son whom she had with deadbeat henry thomas jay ryan simon james urbaniak is still in jail one day the son gets expelled for bringing a pornographic toy to school but this is no ordinary toy it holds a secret that explains much of what happened in the first movie and this secret delves deeper into geopolitics than syriana br br i must say that i'm quite impressed with what hal hartley has accomplished here maybe this one doesn't quite reach the original's quality but it certainly takes a good look at what's going on in the world and the end leaves open the possibility for another sequel br br also starring jeff goldblum
and all through the house is a special crypt episode not only because it's from the first season but this episode was the first one i saw i remember as a young man being on vacation with my parents that summer in 1989 in our hotel room in south carolina on hbo i saw this episode and i was buried to the crypt right then and forever i had always been a fan of horror suspense series and liked monster movies and with this series started by hbo i again had fearful pleasure this episode being the first one i saw is memorable for me and one of my favorites it's just so enjoyable with a nice twist and all through the house has a nice cozy setting on a snowy christmas eve which is a perfect way to get you relaxed for holiday chopping well anyway you have mary ellen trainor who by the way plays in several warner brothers works usually small parts as a greedy philandering wife who takes care of her hubby while waiting on some money and a new romance only like most horror series things take a turn for the worst and bad people get what they deserve the odds are greatly stacked when a maniac dressed as santa escapes from a local nut house making for a late holiday chopping on christmas eve as from the old e c comic lessons you learn bad people get what they axe for well this tale ends with a perfect holiday scream also this tale was in the 1972 movie and featured joan collins this is without a doubt one of my favorites and probably one of the classic crypt episodes of all time
with iphigenia mikhali cacoyannis is perhaps the first film director to have successfully brought the feel of ancient greek theatre to the screen his own screenplay an adaptation of euripides' tragedy was far from easy compared to that of the other two films of the trilogy he directed the story has been very carefully deconstructed from euripides' version and placed in a logical strictly chronological framework better conforming to the modern methods of cinematic story telling cacoyannis also added some characters to his film that do not appear in euripides' tragedy odysseus calchas and the army this was done in order to make some of euripides' points regarding war the church and government clearer finally cacoyannis' iphigenia ending is somewhat ambiguous when compared to euripides' br br the film was shot on location at aulis the director of photography giorgos arvanitis shows us a rugged but beautiful greece where since the homeric days time seems to have stood still he takes advantage of the bodies the arid land the ruins the intense light and the darkness the harshness of the landscape is particularly fitting to the souls of the characters the camera uses the whole gamut of available shots from the very long reinforcing the vastness and desolation of the landscape as well as the human scale involved to the extreme close ups dissecting and probing deep into the soul of the tormented characters in particular the film's opening with a bold accelerating tracking shot along a line of beached boats followed by an aerial view of the many thousands of soldiers lying listlessly on the beach is a very effective means of communicating agamemnon's awesome political and military responsibility br br no word but sublime can describe the stunning performances of costa kazakos agamemnon irene papas clytemnestra and tatiana papamoschou iphigenia kazakos and papas embody the sublimity of the classical greece tragedy kazakos' character is extremely down to earth and his powerful look into the camera more than his words reveals the unbelievable torment tearing his soul irene papas is the modern quintessence of classic greek plays in iphigenia she is terrible in her anguish and even more so for what we know will be her vengeance tatiana papamoskou in her first role on the screen is outstanding in her portray of the innocent iphigenia which contrasts with kazakos' austere depiction of her father agamemnon br br cacoyannis is faithful to euripides in his representation of the other characters odysseus is a sly scheming politician achilles a vain narcissistic warrior menalaus is self centered obsessed with his honor eager to be avenged and to have his wife and property restored br br the costumes and sets are realistic no hollywood there agamemnon's quarters resembles a barn he dresses as do the others in utilitarian hand woven simple garb clytemnestra's royal caravan is made up of rough hewn wooden carts br br the music is by the prolific contemporary music composer mikis theodorakis theodorakis' score intensifies the dramatic and cinematographic unfolding reflects on the psychological aspect of the tragedy and accentuates its dimensions and actuality br br this film and the story it narrates offer considerable insight into the lost world of ancient greek thought that was the crucible for so much of our modern civilization it teaches us much about ourselves as individuals and as social and political creatures euripides questions the value of war and patriotism when measured against the simple virtues of family and love and reflects on woman's vulnerable position in a world of manly violence in his adaptation of euripides' tragedy cacoyannis revisits all of these themes in a modern clear and dramatic fashion br br the relationships governing the political machinations are clearly demonstrated war corrupts and destroys the human soul to such an extent that neither the individual nor the group can function normally any longer with the possible exception of menelaus whose honor has been tarnished by his own wife's elopement with her lover everyone else has his own private motivation for going to war with troy which has nothing to do with helen the thirst for power agamemnon greed the army odysseus or glory achilles and so in a real sense helen became the wmd of the trojan war the war stripped of all homeric glamor and religious sanctioning was just an imperialist venture spurred primarily by the desire for material gain all else being a convenient pretext br br another conflict raised in the film is that between the church and the state calchas who represents the church feeling the challenge to his priestly authority and wishing to destroy agamemnon for the insult to the goddess he serves tells him to sacrifice his daughter in consenting to the sacrifice the king comes closer to his moral undoing but in refusing loses his power over the masses his army who are brainwashed by religion of course for agamemnon it's a game the king must go along with the charade whether he honestly believes in the gods or not until he realizes too late that he has ensnared himself into committing a despicable filicide br br is it a sacrifice or a murder and how can we tell the difference between the two by focusing on the violent and primitive horror of a human sacrifice and worst of all the sacrifice of one's own child euripides cacoyannis creates a drama that is at once deeply political and agonizingly personal it touches on a most complex and delicate ethical problem facing any society the dire conflict between the needs of the individual versus those of the society in the case of iphigenia however as in the biblical tale of abraham and isaac the father is asked to kill his own child by his own hand what sort of god would insist on such payment can it be just or moral even if divinely inspired finally does the daughter's sacrificial death differ from the deaths of all the sons and daughters who are being sent to war these are many deep questions raised by a two hour film
alicia silverstone pre clueless plays a modern day crime obsessed teenager attempting to solve the brutal slaying of a local girl pat verducci wrote and directed this b flick which isn't especially well made but is however surprisingly serious minded in regards to its leading character silverstone is appealing and successful in carving out an interesting young woman here despite the picture's kitschy undermining the supporting cast including kevin dillon and michael bowen isn't bad though the violence in the last act goes overboard not a cheesy camp fest but nothing exceptionally memorable either 1 2 from
the seventh sign borrows a lot from rosemary's baby and the omen it actually blends the two stories even its title recalls bergman' s the seventh seal br br nevertheless it begins well enough with all the omens scattered on the whole earth and in parallel a seemingly distinct plot with moore's husband trying to save a poor boy who killed his parents who were brother and sister from death penalty this time both christian and jewish religions are called to the rescue even the wandering jew is involved which makes the lines sometimes unintentionally funny have you ever been to sunday school but they taught me that god was love the best scene imho is the short dialog between priest john heard who does not seem to take things seriously too bad he was not given a more important part because his laid back acting is priceless and the young jew br br demi moore probably registered the same desire as ex husband bruce willis saving the world she does not save the movie for all that
this is probably one of the worst movies ever made it's terrible but it's so good it's probably best if you don't watch it expecting a gripping plot and something fantastically clever and entertaining because you're going to be disappointed however if you want to watch it so you can see 50 million vases and goro's fantastic hair bad english you're in for a real treat the harder you think about the film the worse it gets unless you're having a competition to spot the most plot holes screw ups in which case you've got hours of entertainment ahead i'd only really recommend this film for the bored or the die hard smap fans and even then the latter should be a bit careful because goro's japanese fans were a bit upset about it they thought he was selling himself out he wasn't really not when johnny kitagawa who was the executive producer can do that for him
fate stay night is an animated series inspired by a h game somehow the producers turned it around making this a successful series without any of the h stuff it couldn't have been any other way because the development of the characters is great just the way it's pictured in this series and any alteration of that could only ruin perfection you'll understand once you see all the episodes br br despite a relatively slow start the producer took his time on presenting the characters things gain momentum quickly and soon after mid series the action gets so intense that glues you to your seat br br the topic of the series concentrates on the war of holy grail that has been taking place in the fukuky city for the last 50 years the pilot actually starts with the conclusion of the previous war and develops from there on shiro is the only survivor of the fire that started during the last battle and enveloped a large portion of the city he unwillingly witnesses a fight between two servants that triggers his reiju holy mark to summon one of the most powerful servants of the battlefield saber his first contact with saber left him stunned such immeasurable beauty i was at a lost for words br br you mustn't compare this series with any other to fully understand it's plot fsn offers much more than some cool sword fights good animation spectacular lights great soundtrack it offers excellent character and relationship development it presents the changes that take place within the characters personalities as the events precipitate the action reveals believable dynamic emotional and behavioral patterns of the individuals not similar to the linear type other series use that are constantly shaping their personalities to reveal from under the mask of perfection flawed characters br br the saber character is tied to a medieval legend that has been altered to fit this series and should be accepted as such you shouldn't watch fsn thinking that it doesn't present the viewer with the historic fact just remember that this is adventure fantasy series and not a documentary and enjoy this as long as you can the ending is sudden and unexpected and if there were twice as many episodes i would have watched them in the same breath
i saw this movie at the afi dallas festival most of the audience including my wife enjoyed this comedy drama but i didn't it stars lucas haas brick alpha dog molly parker kissed the five senses hollywoodland and adam scott first snow art school confidential the director is matt bissonnette who's married to molly parker all three actors do a fine job in this movie about 3 friends the marriage of two of them and infidelity involving the third it all takes place at a lake house and it looks wonderful the film wants to treat its subject as a comedy first and then a drama and i thought it needed to be the other way around
a classic cartoon always enjoyable and funny it has an interesting plot complete with lovable characters road rovers is a show worth seeing it is a short 13 episodes and if you can ever manage a chance to see it you should unfortunately it is very hard to find i think warner brothers studios should release a dvd that contains all 13 episodes i would definitely buy it if they did and if they do you should buy it too if you have kids who like dogs they will love road rovers road rovers should have gotten more attention while it was being aired it was definitely an original and very special show that should have been appreciated much more than it was
this movie is about a young scientist who creates a serum that re animates the dead he first uses it on his brother when he is shot dead in a drive by his brother then infects the other gang members in some scenes the zombies are seen walking very slowly and in other scenes they run pretty fast which makes little sense the acting is mediocre but the story doesn't help the film the makeup consists of blood on the face of the zombies the budget for this film i'm sure was very limited i believe the film could have been better made had the story been more original and with a better budget if you wan't to see a good zombie flick don't see this one
want to know the secret to making a slasher film set at a fitness center work just pad the film out with lovely ladies in super tight workout outfits and have them bump and grind the floor like they are at a gentleman's club that's what the makers of this horrid slasher film did and that little gimmick kept me watching till the bitter end this is the worst slasher film i have ever seen but every time i was ready to switch the channel they'd add another scene with the workout girls and i'd stay put as a slasher film killer workout fails in every category i can think of as a showcase for beautiful girls working out it is a success strong recommendation to avoid unless the thought of half the film being a big t a show appeals to you
it is not known whether marilyn monroe ever met and spoke with albert einstein and since the mysterious disappearance of her diary after her equally mysterious death we may never know but in their lifetime the opportunity was there br br scripted by terry johnson from his own play nicolas roeg's insignificance imagines an encounter in a new york hotel room one night in 1953 between the two icons plus joe dimaggio busey and senator joseph mccarthy curtis but only on one level on another level it elevates or reduces these 'personalities' and what a lousy phrase that is to mere avatars the characters are deliberately unnamed at once greater and lesser in status br br the title insignificance is both apposite and deeply ironic here dimaggio's net worth has been reduced to little more than a picture on a bubblegum card monroe too is reduced to her constituent parts of dress hair lipstick wiggle and voice by uncovering their insecurities and reversing their roles the film brings into sharp focus received notions of celebrity exploding the cult of personality br br furthering the theme there will be another explosion at the film's climax hiroshima in a hotel suite in which 'the actress' is burned to a cinder in seconds a literal deconstruction of fame goodbye norma jean history informs the script which in turn shakes history upside down as roeg mused after watching johnson's play for the first time these characters were mythic not invented by any single person not the public or the press probably not even by the characters themselves as played by theresa russell marilyn a closet intellectual in real life lectures a childlike einstein 'the professor' played by emil on the theory of relativity using balloons and a flashlight while getting the professor to show off his legs in conscious parody of her own role in the seven year itch the movie the actress is seen to be working on in the film's opening br br history records that monroe's then husband fading baseball star dimaggio played by busey as a tenderly psychotic simpleton was unhappy about her iconic dress splaying scene in the film precipitating their break up right on cue we discover the jealous 'ballplayer' in a bar bemoaning the fact that if i want to see her underwear i just walk down to the corner like all the other guys br br in contrast to the professor the ballplayer believes the universe is round a contention shared by native americans but the big chief sampson of one flew over the cuckoo's nest fame who operates the roosevelt hotel's elevator has been all but disenfranchised from his own culture i no longer cherokee i watch tv meanwhile 'the senator' is investigating the professor who is on the eve of delivering a pacifist speech to the united nations but whom the senator suspects is a red in fact as he divulges to monroe einstein is wracked with guilt over hiroshima and what the white heat future holds yet in a seemingly godless universe all such worries and aspirations are rendered insignificant in the light of a higher atomic power br br roeg really is the perfect director to bring johnson's stage play to the screen throughout tortured childhood flashbacks and pessimistic flash forwards ka boom draw unexpected connections between time place and circumstance with the repeated visual motif of a wristwatch employed to mark time's passing but perhaps also to suggest all time is one time each moment co existing as evinced by his back catalogue it's something of a hobbyhorse for a director enchanted with the notion of synchronicity see don't look now in particular here 1920 bleeds into 1945 and drip feeds into the 1980s a period in which another 'actor' has taken on his greatest role as the president of the united states br br if all this sounds rather heavy going quantum physics is surely involved the execution is anything but owing to johnson's witty zippy screenplay roeg's playful direction opening out an essentially stagey set up and the cast themselves who are on stellar form tony curtis especially leaves denture marks in the wood panelling as the paranoid impotent senator who is seen attempting congress with a monroe impersonator a real one as opposed to russell's before being let down by his dwindling member br br of course curtis once co starred with the real marilyn monroe in some like it hot and whose embrace he memorably described as like kissing hitler as roeg commented everything suddenly seemed connected when the film began to take shape even the actors themselves seemed part of this endless linking it all goes into the pot to be boiled down and served up in new and fascinating ways
i agree with most of the other guys a waste of photons and valuable time br br nearly no joke is worth the paper is was written on the only highlight from my pov is olli dittrich as pinocchio egal ich muss eh waldsterben this reminds of old times with rtl samstag nacht it is hard to describe the performances of the actors since most of them don't even seem to have a good time during production and just do their thing camera is ok plot is laughable i think you would be ashamed even if you discuss this with lots of beers br br apart from this i yawned all the time wondered about how a script like this could even be considered for production and waited for the end br br my 9 year old son was pleased but then he is pleased by so little at this age br br anyway a 1 point rating here nearly is 1 point too much
this is a classic british comedy thriller i had always wanted to check out but no opportunity had arisen for that until now it's based on a popular stage play which had already been filmed a number of times previously most notably in 1931 by the same director but unfortunately this version seems not to have survived in its entirety for the remake under review the plot has been updated to the then current wartime situation br br anyway i was mainly familiar with early british comedians through the films of will hay given that this one features a similar plot of legendary hauntings smuggling and enemy agents it's very much in that vein it was actually scripted by hay's regular writing team of marriott edgar val guest and j o c orton the stranded travelers element then was an equally tried and true formula the star this time around is arthur askey abetted by richard murdoch none of whose films i had watched before who is as unlikely a hero as hay himself and whose personality proves to be just as potentially irritating but one soon warms up to him and askey certainly comes up with a number of witty lines and amusing bits of business throughout to justify the fact that the lead character of the play and the 1931 film version was split into two here with murdoch acting as the star's straight partner br br the remote single setting the events of the film largely take place during one stormy night provides for some wonderful atmosphere the last half hour with the sudden appearance of a mysterious couple raymond huntley and linden travers and eventually the arrival of the titular vehicle itself is especially gripping and well handled also worth mentioning from the remaining cast list is kathleen harrison as the stereotypical frightened spinster with a parrot as her constant companion and who is driven by all the excitement to take her very first drink
i was curious to watch this movie a lot of people seem to be excited i also have my beliefs i believe in jesus christ but i'm opened for any kind of views or opinions it doesn't matter for me if jesus existed in the way it's written in the bible if maria was a virgin or not or all the other similar pagan coincidences what matters for me is the idea of salvation the idea of love as the only way to find peace in this world br br what made me angry is when somebody takes a sentence present it as a fact but without showing the context it was written for example they showed in this movie following sentence big those enemies of mine who did not want me to be king over them bring them here and kill them in front of me jesus lukas 19 27 what they didn't tell you is the context jesus told a story about an evil king there is no passage in the bible where jesus supports killing he is love after quoting the bible wrong they present us yelling people pseudo christians filled with hate the majority of viewers don't check the informations presented so they start thinking jesus hate not good for me or for anybody else this is pure manipulation people please use your brain don't take everything as a fact they tell you in this movie we destroy our own basis our civilization if we start dismantling jesus in this way and the message he brought to us you saw off the branch you're sitting on
i should have trusted my instincts better no expectations no disappointments instead however i expected to experience a similar masterpiece like koyaanisqatsi 1983 and was brutally disappointed powaqqatsi is in my humble opinion nothing but a cheap attempt to cash in on the cult success of its predecessor and artistically it fails miserably it appears some producer gathered up leftover material from koyaanisqatsi hurriedly threw it together placed everything in slow motion and got some pop entertainer under the pseudonym of philip glass to hurriedly throw together some banal background music which is incessantly repeated where koyaanisqatsi entertains the viewer with clever fast and slow motion changes powaqqatsi is one long sequence of mundane images in slow motion if you view them on your vcr in fast preview mode you'll see what i mean what disappointed me the most however was philip glass's soundtrack i couldn't and still can't believe that these commercial sounding new age type drones which could easily have been composed in one afternoon by any 14 year old on a casio calculator were from the same composer who so brilliantly composed the emotional and perfectly synchronized music for koyaanisqatsi all in all a big waste of time my advice forget commercialism watch koyaanisqatsi again instead
this poor remake of the 1963 classic starts reasonably well then replaces suspense with muddled and pointless special effects for example in the original one of the most chilling moments occurs when nell and theo are lying side by side in twin beds listening in terror to the noises outside their room nell tells theo to let go of her hand because she is hurting her nell then looks across at theo who is several feet away and realises that it was not theo holding her hand in the latest version nell is lying alone in bed when suddenly she dives out and slides across the floor it is only when she tells the unseen force to stop pulling her that we realise what has happened and can anybody explain what nell's final words mean it's about family it's always been about family br br the one redeeming feature is lili taylor's performance but even this cannot save the film catherine zeta jones demonstrates once again that beneath her pretty exterior there is little depth in the original claire bloom subtly suggested her lesbian persuasion zeta jones however has to spell it out for example by asking nell if she has a boyfriend or girlfriend br br definitely one which should be consigned to the pointless remakes graveyard
harsh yes but i call 'em like i see 'em br br i saw this in the late 80's and it was truly one of the most awful boring films i've ever forced myself to watch br br yes the cinematography is lovely the czech settings are truly stunning the political backdrop is enticing but unlike similar historically set stories e g dr zhivago qv this one failed to make the politics relevant to the story or even interesting br br sure olin and binoche are beautiful but this film manages to make even erotic scenes plodding and slow i'm all for romance but this movie was so boring i started hoping the russians would shoot them all and put an end to my misery br br i'm sure if i'd read the book the story would have made a bit more sense however life's too short to expend any more time on this one
this film was amazing it had an original concept that of a vampire movie meets yakuza mob film it is a humorous and yet highly dramatic and tragic movie about friendship love immortality death and happiness and comments subtelly on society on the part of gackt camui the role of sho was excellently delivered and hyde was surprisingly good for his first film as the tortured yet humorous vampire kei i also laughed and cried at the happy go lucky character toshi who grew up with sho i loved each and every second of this this film especially moments such as the funny cigarette scene the fighting scenes and most of all the heartrenching ending
years have gone by since don wilson used his martial arts expertise to take down a robot who was programmed to destroy him he's also married to the blonde reporter stacie foster who led the rebellion in the first film now a new conspiracy is in the works one that involves look alike droids who frame our two heroes and a corporation looking to rule the world there is no plot to back any of this up and cyber tracker 2 becomes a virtual replay of the first movie i admit that i have bought dvds from the bargain bin that were made by pm pm was a company that specialized in cheap jack action flicks like this which had tons of explosions little story and overall nothing but mean edged action some of these titles have been mildly enjoyable last man standing and the sweeper however cyber tracker 2 is stuck with the casting of the charisma less don wilson when comparing the protagonists of similar pm efforts both jeff wincott and c thomas howell are oscar nominees when compared to don wilson another telling sign is that this was directed by richard pepin who has none of the flair joseph merhi seems to have in crafting action sequences that feel much more expensive than their budgets then again though both c thomas and wincott are probably more expensive to obtain cyber tracker 2 is a rip off with a capitol r there are so many steals from better movies robocop terminator universal soldier to even halloween iii that it's almost as if richard pepin is trying to infuse a sense of identity to the pedestrian material yet without the intelligent ideas or at least the mindless zip of great action cyber tracker 2 falls flat there is literally no good idea that isn't borrowed from a better movie and the supporting cast overact the only exception comes from tony burton who is miles better than the material also stacie foster looks like she could be better with far better material however cyber tracker 2 comes off mainly as noisy bland and lackluster as its leading man however with no real martial arts sequences to fall back on all there is is lots of cars tipping over and that alone is no substitute for the bankruptcy of ambition expressed here br br 1 2 out of 4 poor
i have no idea what people are complaining about i saw this movie yesterday and i really liked it stone once again delivered a great character she was just as good as she was in the first basic instinct she still has those smart but tricky answers although sharon may be 48 years old she looks amazing i don't care if she's as fake as a barbie she looks good and that's that basic instinct 2 gives you everything you want from the first sex violence and a great ending that will leave you thinking and talking about it for hours half the people commenting on this movie haven't even saw it so don't listen to them
i found this episode to be one of funniest i've seen in a long time the south park creators have done the best spoof of a romero film i have ever seen they have truly touched on romero's underlying social commentary that he has made with each one of his films i would love to know what george romero's opinion was on this episode i'm sure it was purely positive keeping his true vision for his zombie epics fully intact most spoofs deal with the pure gore without making the viewer think as romero tries to do with his films i think that if a zombie outbreak did happen we may actually worry about our property values before our lives as shown in this episode
dan duryea a perfectly decent b movie actor who made lots of lookalike noirs in the 1940s can't do much with this one young man is accused of murdering an unhappily married singer when he's sentenced to die his wife decides to solve the case herself with help from the dead woman's husband after a dazzling opening shot flick quickly settles into b movie formula it certainly looks good but the twist finish is colorlessly handled and the cast including peter lorre and broderick crawford is just a bit stiff based on a cornell woolrich novel and passable for a single viewing br br from
i actually saw this movie in the theater back in it's original release it was painful to watch peter sellers embarrass himself so badly the story was incredibly lame and difficult to follow and the ending was ridiculous it was just sad to see how the mighty had fallen i won't say that i'm a huge peter sellers fan but i did thoroughly enjoy the pink panther series and i felt that he gave a strong performance in being there but this film should never have been made from what i've read he pursued producing this film against the advice of the people around him fine but that still doesn't excuse the studio actually releasing the film
gregory peck's acting was excellent as one would expect and the cinematography quite stunning even when playing directly into some melodramatic moment but the rest of the film was overacted and hard to watch for me anyway i tried to like it but had to fast forward through the last thirty minutes or so i feel i wasted a couple of good hours had it not been for gregory peck i wouldn't have lasted fifteen minutes 4 10
was this tim meadows first acting role in a movie the character leon is funny enough but shortly after that the sexual jokes and humor are too dumb to listen to anymore some movies can get away with the sexual jokes and base their audiences to know that right when the advertising comes on some movies that do this are american pie and scary movie scary movie was stupid and american pie wouldnt have done well without the sexual jokes the only role besides leon that had some humor that followed was will ferrell the character really was dumb and that was all the dumb humor was all that had me watching the movie was ok and nothing else i dont really understand why the snl people that are dying to leave the show always get a movie based on a character they played on the show the skits last about 5 minutes and if they can make a movie off a 5 minute skit then what is the world coming to molly shannon had superstar cheri o'terri had scary movie but she wasnt a leading role and will had elf but that was good but he did some dumb movie but i cant remember and mike myers with wayne's world how come the mad tv crew dont ever get movie deals seen only one guy break through but only in like 2 movies and a tv show with andy dick but that guy relies on comedy for his life to continue funny or not this movie is not good but had some positive humor what a waste of film and people's money d d

after all you do not go to an orson welles movie to see a nice simple little plot and a burnishing of the image of a happy ever after star br br you go to see theatrically heightened characters locked in conflict against colorful and unusual settings lighted and scored imaginatively photographed bravely and the whole thing peppered with unexpected details of surprise that a wiser and duller director would either avoid or not think of in the first place br br as usual as well as directing welles wrote the script and he also played the hero  a young irish seaman who had knocked about the world and seen its evil but still retained his clear eyed trust in the goodness of others unfortunately for him he reposed this trust in rita hayworth whose cool good looks concealed a gloomy past and murderous inclinations for the future she was married without love to an impotent crippled advocate acted like a malevolent lizard by the brilliant everett sloane br br there is a youthful romanticism underlying it all and this quality came into exuberant play in the lady from shanghai before the inevitable happened welles escaped  to a final triangular showdown in a hall of mirrors which has become one of the classic scenes of the post war cinema  br br welles did not miss a chance throughout the whole film to counterpoint the words and actions with visual detail which enriched the texture and heightened the atmosphere his camera seemed almost to caress rita hayworth as the sun played with her hair and her long limbs while she playfully teased the young seaman into her web
there wasn't a day in 2002 where i wasn't chased by a scarecrow i felt that this film handled a serious issue well br br it brought back a lot of memories as it was so realistic br br even today i have nightmares about corn on the cob and can't even go near the tinned stuff in fear of my life br br i have to admit though at one point in the film i did have to turn it off as it hit too close to home br br for those of you who have never been attacked by a scarecrow by watching this film you could be educated about how it felt for us victims br br this film teaches us not to take life for granted or to mess with corn believe me i've been there and i have the scars br br watch the film its amazing and educational
when people ask me whats the worst movie i've ever seen its this one its not even close to mst3k level riffing or midnight viewing at a theatre or even as disney channel late night filler the only time i've ever wanted to jump off a ride at disney world or disney mgm studios in this case was to grab dick tracey's jacket off the mannequin rip it to shreds and ram it down the tour guides throat saying eat this eat this unholy coat of darkness i've never been so mad at a movie not even nutty professor ii the klumps or flash gordon you want pretty colors and cinematography ain't here babe reviewers keep saying oh but its too look like a comic book well to me its the color of a gordito after several weeks in the sun about as enjoyable too beatty wanders around this landscape jumping around and talking to his watch himself and occasional at the other actors hoping someone will tell him what time the sequel will begin shooting to be fair i have only seen this movie once but my pain threshold is that of a man not a god
the story of ned kelly has been enshrouded in myth and exaggeration for time out of hand and this film is no exception what ensures ned kelly has a permanent place in history is the effort he went to in order to even the odds against the policemen hunting him during several battles he marched out wearing plates of beaten iron off which the bullets available to police at the time would harmlessly bounce indeed it is only because there were a few bright sparks among the victorian police who noticed he hadn't plated up his legs that he was captured and hanged the story has been told in schools and histories of australia for so long that some permutations of the story have ironically become boring the more the stories try to portray kelly as some inhuman or superhuman monster the less people pay attention br br which is where this adaptation of our sunshine a novel about the kelly legend excels rather than attempting to portray a ned kelly who is as unfeeling as the armour he wore the film quickly establishes him as a human being indeed the reversal of the popular legend showing the corruption of the victorian police and the untenable situation of the colonists goes a long way to make this film stand out from the crowd here ned kelly is simply a human being living in a time and place where in order to be convicted of murder one simply had to be the nearest person to the corpse when a policeman found it no i am not making that up about the only area where the film errs is by exaggerating the irish versus english mentality of the battles while the kelly gang were distinctly irish australia has long been a place where peoples of wildly varied ethnicities have mixed together almost seamlessly a scene with some chinese migrants highlights this br br heath ledger does an amazing job of impersonating australia's most notorious outlaw it is only because of the fame he has found in other films that the audience is aware they are watching ledger and not kelly himself orlando bloom has finally found a role in which he doesn't look completely lost without his bow and geoffrey rush's appearance as the leader of the police contingent at glenrowan goes to show why he is one of the most revered actors in that desolate little island state but it is naomi watts appearing as julia cook who gets a bit of a bum deal in this film although the film basically implies that cook was essentially the woman in ned kelly's life but you would not know that from the minimal screen time that she gets here indeed a lot of the film's hundred and ten minutes feels more freeze dried than explorative once the element of police corruption is established in fact the film rockets along so fast at times that it almost feels rushed br br unfortunately most of the film's strengths are not capitalised upon rush barely gets more screen time than his name does in the opening and closing credits ditto for watts and the rest of the cast come off a little like mannequins i can only conclude that another fifteen or even thirty minutes of footage might have fixed this but that leads to the other problem in that the lack of any depth or background to characters other than the titular hero leaves the events of the story with zero impact one scene manages to do the speech making thing well but unfortunately it all becomes a collage of moments with no linking after a while if one were to believe the impression that this film creates a matter of weeks even days passes between the time that ned kelly becomes a wanted man on the say so of one corrupt policeman and the infamous shootout at glenrowan annoyingly the trial and execution of ned kelly is not even depicted here simply referred to in subtitles before the credits roll br br that said aside from some shaky camera work at times ned kelly manages to depict some exciting shootouts and it has a good beginning for that reason i rated it a seven out of ten other critics have not been so kind so if you're not impressed by shootouts with unusual elements and what could more more unusual than full body armour in a colonial shootout then you might be better off looking elsewhere especially if you want a more factual account of ned kelly's life
this was a hilarious movie and i would see it again and again it isn't a movie for someone who doesn't have a fun sense of a humor but for people who enoy comedy like chris rock its a perfect movie in my opinion it is really funnny
this is probably the best of all of the star wars movies br br the starting point of the movie was almost like episode iv spacey cabaret music and thoughts of a cabaret place where the seriousness of mobster jabba the hutt was getting even more serious he ordered luke to die in a basement pit by the bone crushing teeth of bantha who looked almost like a cross between a bear and a shark luke's jedi powers eventually finish the monster off adding to the sneaky rescue of han solo who was frozen alive at the end of episode v jabba was very angry about this that luke was sentenced to die at the sarlacc pit outside br br but all of the star wars good guys especially r2 d2 had other ideas and those other ideas fended off luke's execution in the end most of jabba's soldiers died and princess leia was able to use the force to fatally choke jabba to death br br like in episode iv the death star in episode vi makes its appearance as i analyzed the rebel fleet attacking the imperial fighters around the death star the star destroyer personnel i guessed sped up the arming of the main laser using the imperial fighters as a diversion the 20 25 star destroyers that lined up were ready to attack but was called off and instead the laser weapon on the death star was fired in surprise once it fired the rebel fleet's only hope was that the death star's deflector shield was going to be knocked out and this affected lando so much because he wanted to destroy the death star but he couldn't until the shield was taken out and it was taken out with lando's increasing impatience br br like in episode v the imperial walkers make their menacing appearance with their twin cannons killing at least one of the ewoks but the ewoks found ancient yet unusual way to deal with them for instance chewbacca as well as another ewok was able to commandeer one of the walkers and actually used that to destroy from behind one of the walkers and the other ewoks used logs to knock out two other walkers br br it is amazing what luke could do with his jedi powers on his light sabre like for instance the scene on endor where luke deflects incoming laser shots from a storm trooper speeder bike and using the sabre to knock out part of the bike or in a climax using the sabre to break off his own father's arm during the final sabre fight with sith vader br br you probably know the ewoks celebration after the death star was blown complete with a short display of fireworks drumming on the spoils of victory e g storm trooper masks and luke finally meeting up with leia after luke's own nemesis darth vader now dead is burned on a pyre the celebration include ewoks singing but i think lucas did not buy that even with the strong respect of film composer john williams br br on the home movie version i think lucas himself wanted a different ending in addition to the celebration on endor he wanted shots of celebratory scenes on the several surviving rebel planets including a celebratory laser shot that destroys the statue of the sith the ewoks song was replaced by an alternative instrumental piece he probably wanted the extra stuff to prove that with the death star's destruction balance had been restored to the rebel galaxies
darkman 3 die darkman die is directed by bradford may the same guy who made the first darkman sequel too darkman 3 is worse than darkman 2 and is nothing special in my opinion larry drake is no more as a main villain who is now played by great jeff fahey whose character once again wants to get darkman's work and create this time some ultra strong humans in order to get the leadership of the whole city the film is pretty much the same in plot and execution as darkman 2 but i was mostly irritated by the presence of many scenes from darkman 2 these sequels were made in short time and with little money so these kind of decisions had to be made couple of scenes are pretty stylish and exiting but still this is pretty tired film and often irritatingly stupid too the characters scream and laugh too much and it is very annoying there is no any philosophical depth in the film and this is like a remake of darkman 2 which it still cannot equal darkman 2 had many great scenes and stylish camera work and larry drake's ability to play great villain darkman 3 offers only some nice scenes and moments but mostly this film is tired and full of cliches the few positive things in this movie are flashback edits westlake's nightmares and couple of truly surprising plot turns and tricks and worth mentioning is also pretty nasty death scene of the main villain which was pretty comic book like and inventive without any gore far more interesting than the death of main villain in part two br br darkman 3 is worst in the whole series and we must remember that these two sequels were made directly to video and they don't come even close to raimi's original darkman with liam neeson darkman 2 was okay actioner with plenty of great scenes and suspense but this last entry is tired and often stupid and boring piece of sequel it has some merits as mentioned but overall feeling is that this should not been made in the first place may is talented director so hopefully he can get some more noteworthy projects in the future br br 3 10
while in her deathbed ann lord vanessa redgrave repeats the name harris and recalls the day on the 50's when she was an aspirant singer and traveled from new york to be the maid of honor of her wealthy friend lila wittenborn mamie gummer in newport ann grant claire danes is welcomed by lila's alcoholic and reckless brother buddy hugh dancy in the wittenborn's cottage at seaside and he tells her that his sister is in love actually for their friend and servant harris arden patrick wilson who fought in the war and has graduated in medicine later the bride to be confesses her true feelings about harris to ann however when ann meets harris she has a crush on him and they have a brief affair during one night stand while a tragedy happens with buddy meanwhile ann's daughters the insecure and unstable nina mars toni collette and the happy wife and mother constance haverford natasha richardson are worried with their mother and have differences to be resolved br br evening has one of the best feminine casts i have ever seen in a movie with magnificent performances the resemblance of the stunning mamie gummer with her mother meryl streep is amazing and she has a performance that honors the name of her mother the locations costumes set decoration cinematography and soundtrack are also awesome unfortunately the plot is confused and i have not clearly understood the message of this film why motherhood is so important in the story was constance engendered in the night stand of ann and harris and he would be her father why ann and harris have not stayed together if the guy really loved her like he confesses in their occasional encounter in new york which issues ann lord has resolved after the visit of lila ross was buddy wittenborn bisexual or his love for harris was a fraternal love why nina mars changed her thoughts about motherhood in the end it seems that the screenplay writers or the director failed since they were not able to make sense and fulfillment to the beautiful love story my vote is seven br br title brazil ao entardecer in the eventide
war drama that takes place in louisiana in 1971 it follows a bunch of recruits through basic training and then tigerland an accurate portrayal of vietnam on american soil before they're shipped over it focuses on two men booz colin farrell and paxton matthew davis how they meet become friends and deal with a corwardly squadron leader clifton collins jr and a borderline psycho shea wingham br br a surprisingly non commercial film directed by joel schumacher he uses a hand held camera throughout most of the movie and uses digital video for the combat scenes it works very well the film looks gritty as it should and uncomfortably realistic br br farrell successfully covers up his irish brogue and adopts a pretty convincing southern accent his performance is just superb he's an extremely talented young man davis unfortunately is not that good he's tall muscular very handsome and very bland the rest of the cast however is just great br br this film was thrown away by its studio it had no stars in it a familar story and was considered just another war film it only played a week in boston it's well worth catching on video or dvd br br also farrell and davis have a lengthy nude scene
as soon as it hits a screen it destroys all intelligent life forms around but on behalf of its producers i must say it doesn't fall into any known movie category it deserves a brand new denomination of its own it's a neurological drama it saddens and depresses every single neuron inside a person's brain br br it's the closest thing one will ever get to a stroke without actually suffering one it drives you speechless all you members go numb your mouth falls open and remains so and the most strange symptom of all is that you get yourself wishing to go blind and deaf br br no small feat for such a sort of a movie br br the only word that comes to my mind just having finished my ordeal is outrage
veteran director and producer allan dwan whose huge string of films includes both the utterly forgettable and the recurrently shown for example john wayne in sands of iwo jima tried his hand at a big musical with i dream of jeanie harnessing a lead cast of singers with little past film experience and as it turned out virtually no future he spun a fictional and in no small part offensive story about the great american songwriter stephen foster br br bill shirley is the young lovestruck foster whose kindness to slaves includes giving the money saved for an engagement ring to pay the hospital cost for an injured little black boy his intended is inez mcdowell muriel lawrence whose pesky younger sister jeanie eileen christy is slowly realizing she's in love with the nearly impecunious song smith foster is in love with inez who is revolted by the composer's number 1 on the levee hit parade tune o susannah enter minstrel edwin p christy ray middleton to help launch the profit making phase of foster's career br br this is by the musical film standards of the early fifties a big production the sets are lavish in that special hollywood way that portrayed fakes with all the trimmings the singers aren't half bad and the foster songs are almost impossible to ruin br br but this is also a literal whitewash of the antebellum south the biggest number features black face for all on stage an historical anomaly and a contemporary piece of unthinking racism were these portrayals of blacks anywhere near reality the abolitionists would be rightly condemned for interfering with so beneficent an institution br br i dream of jeanie apparently sank into the studio's vault with barely a death whisper now revived by alpha video for a mere 4 99 it's a period piece with charming songs and repulsive sentimentalizing about the victims of america's great crime slavery br br this was what hollywood was putting out two years before brown v board of education must have warmed the hearts of some moviegoers who wore their bed linen to the theater
i watched the dvd called black widow in the u s a and felt afterward that it was indeed a truly awful movie but they must have cut quite a bit out of the original film or i missed a lot the sex scenes had very little vulgarity and no nudity not even a breast but i've read several other comments on imdb com mentioning the vulgarity and something about a tampon i did not see anything like that just a bad boring film with unlikable characters and a trite sophomoric plot giada colagrande is either paralyzed from the mouth up or botoxed to the gills and nary an expression touches her face and her name makes me think of super sizing a beverage at taco bell i'll have the cola grande it was actually kind of fun it was so bad i got to play like i was in my own mystery science theater 3000 noting things like the fact that dafoe's skin is too big for his face it's really like silly putty
rohmer returns to his historical dramas in the real story of grace elliot an englishwoman who stayed in france during the apex of the french revolution one always suspected that rohmer was a conservative but who knew he was such a red blooded reactionary if you can put aside rohmer's unabashed defense of the monarchy and that is not an easy thing to do given that for instance the french lower classes are portrayed here as hideous louts this is actually an elegant intelligent and polished movie lacking the money for a big cinematic recreation of 18th century france rohmer has instead the actors play against obvious painted cardboards it is a blatantly artificial conceit but it somehow works and newcomer lucy russell succeeds in making sympathetic a character that shouldn't be
this lifetime style movie takes the middle aged divorcee victim who then finally fights back genre to new depths of cartoon like absurdity br br here the 40 something stay at home ex wife of a successful lawyer protagonist daughter away at college is starting a new life after her divorce helped by a female college friend in opening a new dress shop as a sort of franchise expansion deal she has even started up a friendship with her attractive slightly younger perhaps landscape architect gardener who's black but then horror of middle aged women's horrors another 20 something female she took on as a tenant to let a room to starts 'taking over her life br br what this new younger woman threat really does is mildly flirt with the gardener and offer him a glass of wine that gasp really belonged to the divorcee she runs up the utility bills by not turning down the thermostat and backed up the toilet and leaves old food gone bad in the refrigerator and hangs her pieces of african artwork in the living room and so on well she may have killed the cat as well yeah ok the extent to which this one does these things is bad enough but its more than a little ridiculous especially as it turns into a campaign the character reality is that any tiny part of this would drive this particular prissy woman insane so why did she rent the room and to horror of horrors a much younger woman br br supposedly this increasingly arrogant natch younger woman has a mania for seizing control and our brave 40 something must learn to fight back against this evil and erotically hot looking of course 20 something but there's this problem anytime the 20 something starts to maybe get into trouble she uses her power and just flirts or has sex with some guy and escapes the consequences well there actually is something to that capability of good looking 20 somethings it just isn't generally used in quite this sort of way br br the premise is moved along by the device of the 20 something conning the divorcee into formalizing their room rental deal with a written lease produced by her of course the 40 something doesn't know about these things and the 20 something has had help the lease actually gives the younger woman equal right to the whole house during the rental period with utilities thrown in at the fixed price even though an eviction proceeding is soon pending the 20 something soon gets a temporary restraining order against the older woman supposedly because she has been threatening the 20 something you know the judge is sympathetic to all the woe is me of the sexy sweet young thing finally the 40 something's heroic battle back for the house then begins woopie br br the only realistic or perceptive thing in this movie is how horrificly easy tro's or orders of protection are for women to get on nothing more than her unsubstantiated say so although they are generally only this easy against men they are sometimes just as unjustified and just as motivated to seize control of a home as it is here indeed girlfriends who have moved in with their boyfriends can often get them evicted from their own homes or condos on the basis of no proof whatsoever but only an unsubstantiated claim of threats and sometimes without even hearing his side even when there is a hearing it is routinely impossible to rebut claims of threats to prove a negative when the burden of proof is effectively on the accused rather than the accuser this is one of the only areas of american law where that is true and it's a signal outrage of feminist overreaching and the failure of any organized group to resist the steamroller of course that's not likely to be the subject of any lifetime movie in this lifetime br br the absurd basic premise of this movie relies upon the explanation that the 20 something is psychotic and isn't taking her medicine even so it makes no sense she isn't after the successful lawyer ex husband though she does con his help to the ex wife's fury in her quest she's after the house technically to drive the divorcee out of it during the period of the lease this second younger woman is after all that's left after the divorce after affairs with other 20 somethings stole her husband the ex husband seems unattached and basically solicitous after his fling doesn't matter he still strayed br br the protagonist is good enough looking for her age but her outlook attitude and focus is so small minded frumpy and utterly without imagination or life force that it's impossible to care about her well a core group of lifetime fans care i guess judging by the average score the small number of raters gave it i kept watching it only because it was so extremely bad and cartoonish that it had a camp appeal i couldn't resist seeing just how far they'd take it br br spoiler if such a thing is possible with this flick br br well here's a clue the movie ends with the 20 something getting bailed out of jail by promising to listen to her 20 something male co worker and sometimes lover and do whatever he says and let him take care of her he means get her to keep taking her medicine and then tricking him and returning to the house there she climbs the stairs with a knife demonicly stalking her nemesis 40 something who is taking a bath by candlelight secure in the thought that the younger woman is out of her life there's a struggle and the 40 something mom wins by sticking the 20 something with a hypodermic needle full of anti psychotic medicine she had found she then begins stroking her mom like and the two women have a bonding female solidarity moment how sweet
from what critics and audiences indicated birthday girl had to be a big fat clinker still because i love nicole kidman i decided to rent it last night it proved to be quite worthy of watching sure it isn't your basic american comedy and it doesn't take a genius to realize that it is a very british movie but that's why i liked it it was a change from all the other movies around a breath of fresh air sure there were some plot holes but overall it worked first off kidman was fabulous again in a very different not very glamorous but still quite sexy role she just keeps proving that she is one of the top talents in hollywood not only is her russian accent when she speaks english effective but there are times when she carries on long conversations in russian and if you didn't know it was nicole kidman you would never question her authenticity harrison ford should have taken note in k 19 overall a slight little movie that works despite the horrible buzz
fido is a cute comedy that deserves wider recognition especially considering the mainstream crap that is supposed to entertain us these days br br as has already been pointed out this is hardly a real zombie film but rather a sweet satire that employs the undead to point fingers while there are necessarily some bloody scenes there is almost no gore and the way this movie is presented feel good 50s style i can't imagine anyone being actually scared or turned off by fido his fellow sufferers br br while the cast is generally good i felt that moss and nelson stood out the humor is not in your face but rather subdued there's a lot of attention to detail and i caught myself smiling benignly several throughout the movie this is certainly no masterpiece of cinema but it doesn't strive to be instead currie succeeds in delivering a heart warming black comedy
fairly amusing piece that tries to show how smart orcas are but in the meanwhile and quite oblivious to them makes the audience feel stupid by making the most ridiculous film richard harris plays quint i'm sorry that's wrong he plays captain nolan a fisherman who catches sharks for a living but is lured by the big catch and tries to catch a killer whale when the capture of a female killer whale goes awry don't ask it's mate don't ask goes on a rampage don't ask and starts stalking captain nolan don't ask soon captain nolan realizes that they have something in common don't ask pretty amazing film making here folks i got to tell you though the beginning with the whale noises and nothing much else is pretty haunting and the end credits with the most godawful song is pretty entertaining
pleasant story of the community of pimlico in london who after an unexploded ww2 bomb explodes find a royal charter stating that the area they live in forms part of burgundy br br this movie works because it appeals to the fantasy a lot of us have about making up our own rules and not having to listen to them a solid cast of british stalwarts especially stanley holloway makes this more believable br br there are some very nice moments in the film such as when the people have ran out of supplies and other londoners on the other side of the barricade start throwing food and other things over to them br br even though you always knew pimlico would become part of the uk again the people of pimlico and as a consequence the viewer doesn't mind when this happens leaving a nice happy feeling br br it's amazing to think that these low budget movies from a small studio in london still remain so popular over fifty years later the producers must have got something right
previous comments encouraged me to check this out when it showed up on tcm but it was a severe disappointment lupe valdez is great but doesn't get enough screen time frank morgan and eugene palette play familiar but promising characters but the script leaves them stranded br br the movie revolves around the ego of lee tracy's character who is at best a self centered physically and verbally abusive jerk the reactions of the public are poorly thought out and unbelievable making the shenanigans seem like contrivances of a bad writer and it strains credulity that the lupe velez character could fall for him br br the stinging one liners mentioned in another review must be dependent on the observer since i didn't even notice that an attempt was being made
this is a very well made film meticulously directed and with some excellent character acting that at times is deeply moving for example the scene with the loyal but unsophisticated sidekick cop and his wife the plot is convincingly worked out and exciting the gangster character is particularly interesting and plays an almost metaphysical role in the life of the hero it's made clear that the cops are just as rough and ready as the underworld characters br br a couple of slight reservations i found the ending slightly one sided as it celebrates the hero's successful integration into the structure of the police and justice system which collapses the ambiguity of the police characters which has been maintained up to that point also i found the lead female character somewhat weak little more than a catalyst for the salvation of the hero all she seems to do is weep and swoon as the tough guys battle it out
the most agile fat guy in martial arts does it again an early sammo film that has him imitating his character's hero bruce lee sammo is amazingly lee like in his actions and fighting the way he slips into bruce's style and then back to his own more familiar kung fu is a joy to watch and shows how accomplished and adaptable he is at his art throw in a bit of slapstick humour so beloved of this type of flick and this a movie that has it all comedy some unintentional like the fake black guy action and some incredible fight scenes br br a great beer and buddies movie that is worth an hour and a half of anyone's time
first off i dislike almost all neil simon movies but there is something about this that is unique that draws me in and i would say it is among the most entertaining comedies i have seen the second time i watched it the connection was clear when did neil simon meet my grandmothers br br ah afraid they might sue so he changed them into men and how dull would it be if they were only housewives show biz stars is more fun well this is a personal review and my still living grandmother at age 97 she even outlived walter matthau's magnificent impersonation of her would deny it but some of you must find resonance in these characters br br secondly i have little tolerance for george burns but somehow he turned in one of the finest supporting performances i can recall and my late grandmother even enjoyed it although failing to recognize the remarkable similarities she shared with the film character br br very ethnic in flavor and over the top you will either laugh and laugh or turn this off for me the pleasure lingers
this film is really bad so bad that even christopher lee cannot save it a poor story an even poorer script and just plain bad direction makes this a truly outstanding horror film the outstanding part being that it is the only horror film that i can honestly say i would never ever watch again this garbage make plan nine from outerspace look like oscar material
the sexploitation movie era of the late sixties and early seventies began with the allowance of gratuitous nudity in mainstream films and ended with the legalization of hardcore porn it's peak years were between 1968 and 1972 one of the most loved and talented actresses of the era was monica gayle who had a small but fanatic cult of followers she was actually able to act unlike many who filled the lead roles of these flicks and her subsequent credits proved it and her seemingly deliberate fade into obscurity right when her career was taking off only heightens her mystique br br gary graver the director was also a talent probably too talented for the sexploitation genre and his skill combined with monica gayle's screen presence makes sandra the making of a woman a pleasantly enjoyable experience the film never drags and you won't have your finger pressed on the fast forward button
the film transported everyone back to october 20 1944 where we seemed to be part of the great philippine 'i shall return' landing scene it was on that leyte shore where general macarthur reaped his fame br br above all gregory peck triumphed in his portrayal of the great general it is the stride the set of the shoulders the intensity it's what both men have had in common intensity total absorption devotion with macarthur it was for the military with peck it was for the challenge of acting an academy award winner for to kill a mockinbird an oscar nominee for keys to the kingdom the yearling gentleman's agreement and twelve o'clock high he has played everything from an apparently homicidal amnesiac to a crusading journalist from a troubled gunfighter to an obsessed attorney from biblical david to captain horatio hornblower he has brought to them all his own unique insight his character his sincerity warmth and love and especially his humor br br there is a scene where 'macarthur' stands on deck with the 'president of the philippines ' we can hear the dialogue general i hope the water isn't too deep says the 'president ' because my people will find out i can't swim then come peck's sonorous voice and my people are going to find that i can't walk on water br br as macarthur peck once again justified his reputation as a giant in the film industry through him we felt macarthur's emotions we knew his anger his happiness and we understood the relationship with his whole family
if there is a hell it contains a screening room in which grand canyon is playing over and over again on an eternal loop one would hope that the presence of so many marvelous actors danny glover alfre woodard kevin kline mary louise parker would help make up for the presences of mary mcdonnell whose penance is to watch her own films for all eternity but no apparently they injected those other actors with a serum made from mcdonnell the entire affair is pretentious overblown insulting if you are deaf or know anyone who is be prepared for your blood to boil at the ludicrous tdd scene grand canyon is filled with obnoxious self involved people but never gives us a reason to like understand sympathize with or even tolerate them with rare exception they are insufferable losers that the gene pool would be better off without there's no plot to speak of no character development these people won't ever develop no break out performance and the most arch writing you'll ever encounter in a film the best thing about grand canyon its title this is one large hole of a movie
well it's been a long year and i'm down to reviewing the final film for 2004 panaghoy sa suba call of the river placed second in the recent metro manila film festival as expected it didn't do so well at the box office as it was too artsy for the common moviegoers especially since mmff is the season where a lot of families go out to see movies br br it was quite intriguing to see a movie that was not in filipino or english play out in the screen i thought cesar montano did a good job both as a star and director his great vision and creativity really helped this film he was also very effective as the lead star and was able to express a wide range of emotions that was required for the film also performing well was young actress rebecca lusterio she did a great job portraying bikay the younger sister of duroy i hope to see her in many more film projects in the future perhaps venturing into other genres i think that the fact that this film was in her local dialect really helped her br br some of the camera shots in the film were done very well the scenery was made breathtaking even though i feel that if a lesser effort would have looked completely different br br in terms of the story i feel that the writers could have delved further into the lives of the lesser characters in the film i certainly won't be raving about the story of this film
magnificent and unforgettable stunningly atmospheric and brilliantly acted by all br br i really cannot understand what sort of people are panning this masterpiece and giving the preponderance of votes as 8 and nine ones br br this along with grapes of wrath is john ford's greatest movie i would say that long voyage home is next in line though quite a way back br br rating 10 it deserves a 12
discovery channel animal planet must be ashamed of themselves this fantasy is modeled after the walking with dinosuars series even though this is 100 fantasy it is presented in the same factual and archaeological way even mixing the fantasy dragons with t rexs and the extinction of the dinos added to being shown on an educational channel instead of say sci fi it gives an air of factual authenticity to this show br br on its own the show is about an 7 5 10 far as entertainment goes but the way in which it is presented i have to give it a 1 10 don't get me wrong i have no problem with fantasy but they way they put this out is so wrong i can really see young kids and slow adults believing that they did find a dragon and that this is real br br i also think this weakens the great walking with dinosuars series because now you have to view that with a mind of how much is fantasy on that mini series
i just can't agree with the above comment there's lots of interesting and indeed amazing filmic imagery in this one it has an unusual structure and moves well toward a frightening climactic sequence that is notable for it's effective use of silence what's more it explores the odd impulse of suicide in a very frank way not pulling any punches in what it shows yet not dwelling and over sensationalising the subject matter it has hints of documentary about it as well as horror and art house cinema and deserves a place amongst the canon of 'different' horror films like the blair witch project and the original ring both of which it predates and could well be an unacknowledged influence on it's definitely worth seeing if you're interested in the edges of horror cinema
the tv productions at the 2000's start were between weak and bad before marks like alias lost prison break desperate housewives or monk the tv didn't have the right hit yet which could capture the attention and the interests of the 2000s' viewer titles like relic hunter mutant x the lost world sheena or even baywatch hawaii weren't encouraging for you to watch and follow or at least weren't that captivating and interesting all the time as what preceded them special unit 2 was no exception in fact it's men in black meets the x files' spoof as if these were the special unit 1 but even according to this brilliant formula it didn't work well it was promising at the time there was some saturation out of the supernatural cases after a decade of many x files already so the natural spirit to lampoon it naughtily too imagine mulder as womanizer however special unit 2 wasn't the strongest in this or a strong when it comes to make a comic sci fi show it was highly ridiculous where for instance every sexy situation must turn into ugly disgusting one it enjoyed that bad taste sickeningly michael landes was non charismatic and mostly unbearable as a comedian his chemistry with alexondra lee as well as any supposed sexual attention was all languid sure the show got a funny look but overall it was unfunny work it's clear that there was nothing more interesting than its main idea among evan katz 's other works as a co writer and a co producer like seven days before or 24 later this must be a low point despite the distinctive personality it managed to be a silly jest for most of the time therefore if that was there goal so they made one of the silliest indeed and truly it would be one of the rarest times to be thankful for the cancellation of a show after 19 episodes of it only
the early career of abe lincoln is beautifully presented by ford not that anyone alive has seen footage of the real lincoln but fonda wearing a fake nose is uncanny as lincoln with the voice delivery walk and other mannerisms exactly as one would imagine lincoln to have been ford in the first of three consecutive films he made with fonda is at the top of his form perfectly evoking early 19th century america the story focuses on a pair accused of murder that lincoln defends and the courtroom scenes are quite well done the supporting cast includes many of ford's regulars this was alice brady's last film as she died months after its release
in all honesty this series is as much a classic as television goes as the original poem is to the world's literature far from being crassly exploitative it is a beautiful and respectful rendering of one of the western culture's defining texts br br i was moved by the plight of odysseus and his followers touched by the drama of the fall of troy which was felt but not seen intrigued by the way the gods played with the fate of mortals it should be mentioned that the gods appearing here are not ridiculous cgi creatures flitting around on their ankle wings or poorly cast fashion models in bikinis as in homer's work they act through mortal agents or rarely are represented by classical statuary br br it's a pity it's not available in dvd especially given the vastly inferior and cheesy adaptations of the odyssey that one can find in video stores
this movie is a perfect example of a film that divides people into 2 groups those who get the joke and those who don't people usually attack what they don't understand this film has a comic style and charm that has been unparalleled since it's a great comedy and a great romance it's a perfect date movie a perfect movie for someone who wants a good lighthearted laugh and if your perspective is too tense maybe this movie isn't for you and you may need counseling it is an injustice that paramount has kept this film on the shelf since the early 80's having never seen the light of day on dvd yet they feel an urban version of the honeymooners is a good idea i find it odd that my two alltime favorite romantic comedies have never been released on dvd the other being gene wilder's the world's greatest lover which fox has sat on since the early 80's as well yet from justin to kelly is in nearly every video store in the country there is no justice in the world maybe those who took the time to bash this will enjoy from justin to kelly i'm sure that one is watered enough for them to get sometimes with age people lose their sense of humor or sometimes it just goes stale and they find comic satisfaction in reruns of full house
for starters hobgoblins tries to ape the more successful gremlins that's bad enough but they don't even try to make anything that closely resembles a movie here instead it's more like a bargain basement everything must go clearance of embarrassing scenes inappropriate sound fx acting as bland as unflavored tapioca and a script that takes everything humans hold sacred in their motion pictures and throws 'em down the old tube aroo br br the plot grrrr meddling kids track down gremlin like creatures from movie lot before they kill people by projecting their fantasies sound cool does it well see that wall on the other side of your room run right at it top speed face first see that is cooler than this movie br br you dare to doubt quick name something else one of the leads has been in other than this what other scripts have the writers done since hobgoblins name another rick sloane directoral effort how many hobgoblins action figures do you have see thank you br br i cannot believe i took so long to write about such a horrible film i'd rather write about more important things like the separation of church and state economic restructuring in europe that kind of thing but no hobgoblins it is and it is bad bad like your grandparents' wallpaper bad as pink flamingos on your lawn bad like underwear that says home of the whopper and i think we'll stop there br br well mike and the robots fight valiantly but try as they might they can do only so much with hobgoblins before they realize that yes the director does need kicked in the shin br br real real hard br br one star for hobgoblins seven stars for the mst3k version
one of the finest films ever made why it only got a 7 6 rating is a mystery this film is a window into the world of the black experience in america should be mandatory viewing for all white people and all children above age 10 i recommend watching it with the long walk home as a companion piece if you think whoopi goldberg's work is about homer and eddie or hollywood squares think again don't miss this movie which should have won the oscar and read the book too
the british 'heritage film' industry is out of control there's nothing wrong with filming classic novels but why must they all be filmed by talentless nobodies this film rips the guts out of orwell's tough novel turning it into a harmless fluffy romantic comedy 'aspidistra' may not be orwell's best work but no one who reads it can forget its superb depiction of poverty orwell emphasises not only the cold and the hunger but the humiliation of being poor in the novel london is a bleak grey cold heartless city and comstock prays for it to be blasted away by a squadron of bombers but this film irons out anything that might be in any way disturbing and creates instead a jolly nostalgic trip to charming 1930s london in which everything is lit with shafts of golden sunlight and even the slums of lambeth are picturesque and filled with freshly scrubbed urchins and happy prostitutes comstock's poems about the sharp wind sweeping across the rubbish strewn streets seem completely out of place in this chocolate box world worst of all is the script's relentless bonhomie ancient jokes and clunking dialogue it's so frustrating because richard e grant is the perfect person to play gordon comstock and the film is packed with great actors but it's all for nothing this film made me so angry britain's literary history is something to be proud of for its richness complexity and power and what do we do with it we employ bland nobodies to turn it into soft centred anodyne pap for people who want to feel that they are 'getting some culture' while they drink their horlicks and quietly doze off
i agree with jerry it's a very underrated space movie of course how many good low budget ones aren't underrated if i remember correctly the solution to the mystery was a sort of variation but not rip off of 2001 because the computer controlling the spaceship had actually been a man who had somehow been turned into a computer and like hal they tried to disconnect his mind but not the mechanical parts of him and as with hal it led to disaster there is at least one funny moment when the christopher cary character who can't find any food finds the abandoned pet bird there's a kind of ominous moment but then the obvious thing doesn't happen after all
every once in a while the conversation will turn to favorite movies i'll mention titanic and at least a couple people will snicker i pay them no mind because i know that five years ago these same people were moved to tears by that very movie and they're too embarrassed now to admit it br br i just rewatched titanic for the first time in a long time expecting to simply enjoy the story again i was surprised to find that the movie has lost none of its power over these five years i cried again in all the same places it brought me back to 1997 when i can remember how a movie that no one thought would break even became the most popular movie of all time a movie that burst into the public consciousness like no other movie i can recall yes even more than star wars and today many people won't even admit they enjoyed it folks let's get something straight you don't look cool when you badmouth this film you look like an out of touch cynic br br no movie is perfect and this one has a few faults some of the dialogue falls flat and some of the plot surrounding the two lovers comes together a little too neatly however none of this is so distracting that it ruins the film br br leonardo dicaprio and kate winslet are wonderful leo is one of the fine actors of his generation wait 'til you see him in gangs of new york before you call him nothing more than a pretty boy kate winslet was so strong in this film the movie really was hers and she held it together beautifully br br james cameron managed what many believed was impossible by recreating a completely believable titanic the sinking scenes were horrific just as they were that night how anyone can say the effects were bad is beyond me i was utterly transfixed br br this film is one memorable scene after another titanic leaving port in southampton rose and jack at the bow flying iceberg right ahead the screws hanging unbelievably out of the ocean the screams of the doomed after she went down and that ending that brought even the burliest man in the theater to tears br br the music which has also been a victim of the film's success was a key ingredient james horner's score was simply perfect and the love theme was beautiful and tragic too bad celine dion's pop song version had to destroy this great bit of music for so many br br i confess i am a titanic buff as such i relished the opportunity to see the ship as we never got to see it in all its beauty perhaps watching it sink affected me more than some because i've had such an interest in the ship all my life however i doubt many of those i saw crying were titanic buffs i applaud cameron for bringing this story to the masses in a way that never demeaned the tragedy the film was made with such humanity br br another reviewer said it better than i ever could open up your hearts to titanic and you will not be disappointed
revolt of the zombies proves that having the same director revamp and recycle an idea doesn't necessarily make lightning strike twice br br the halperin brothers responsible for the horror classic white zombie made this trite piece of garbage a mere few years later to cash in on its popularity and even recycled close ups of lugosi's eyes from that previous film there was a court battle with the white zombie film's rights owners who didn't want the halperins to be able to use the word 'zombie' in this title that word was the only thing that could help this film because as everyone knows bad films can make much more money simply by having the word 'zombie' appear in the title knowing what victor halperin was capable of a few years before only makes this uninteresting film more insulting it seems he never directed another horror film after this debacle the zombies here seem not to be true walking dead but simply hypnotism victims br br wanna create a mind controlled army of zombies be ready to crack a few eggs including your own br br the lame plot man falls in love with scheming woman who plays with his heart and becomes engaged to him only to make his friend whom she loves jealous this sends man into a spiral of madness in which he tries using zombie mind control techniques to change things to his advantage in an attempt to win over a woman who isn't worth spit br br this includes one of the most blatantly obvious plot developments i've ever seen you'd have to be blind or stupid not to see the ending coming the acting isn't even good this movie makes the racially insensitive king of the zombies which appeared on the same double bill dvd i bought seems like an atmospheric horror masterpiece by comparison and reminds us that not every black and white film is a classic it makes the atomic age sci fi alien zombie cheese fest invisible invaders seem like a serious drama this is one big ball of cheese so ridiculously melodramatic it could probably make many a korean film fan twitch south korean films are often known for their use of melodrama the credits list the ironically named company favorite films i'm not sure whose favorite film this would be but they're obviously an idiot br br not recommended for fans of zombies romance or classic films
it's a colorful slasher movie that's about it br br it has the mystery element that scream made so popular in slasher movies but i never care for such things figuring out who's the bad guy is not that interesting considering the clues are all misleading anyway br br the death scenes were inventive and gorey bringing back memories of 80's horror movies like friday the 13th br br another nice thing about this movie is that it's hard to pinpoint the surviving girl unlike in scream and ikwydls where it was obvious br br people who don't like slasher movies won't like this movie as simple as that i truly enjoyed it and i plan to watch it again while waiting for more of the same br br mb
i don't know where to begin this movie feels a lot like one of those cheap saturday morning kids shows that they used to make back in the late eighties early nineties sort of like captain power or the power rangers it's full of bad digital overlays and really cheesy sounding secret agencies and villains br br the acting is so bad that it's not even funny the direction is terrible and there is little to now continuity it seems as if someone just threw a bunch of scenes together and forgot that there was supposed to be a plot br br perhaps one of the most ridiculous scenes in the movie comes early on when several villains plant an explosive device in an agents car for some reason even though the device is clearly stated as being remote detonated the bad guys decide to chase her down on their motorcycles as she drives away this chase carries on all the while with the bad guys doing ludicrous and completely pointless bike stunts standing up on the bikes doing wheelies and so on at one point a crash happens and one of the attackers is thrown from his bike we see the bike clearly cgi thrown over the agents car but the rider has vanished then a few seconds later the rider and bike return apparently unscathed by the crash at this point even though the car has an explosive device planted in it the attackers choose to shoot the agent while driving past then blow up her car which was also clearly done with cgi sound confusing it is and so is the rest of the movie br br i might point out that when i say cgi we aren't talking about lord of the rings type cgi here we're talking the cheap cheesy power rangers type cgi actually i think it would have been done better on power rangers br br why savini and todd did this movie i will never know i can only assume they did for money as a favor to someone or because they were blackmailed into it probably the last one
i think that people are under estimating this incredible film people are seeing it as a typical horror movie that is set out to scare us and prevent us from getting some sleep which if it was trying to do then it would deservedly get a 1 10 but i viewed this film with a few friends and we found it very entertaining and though it was a good movie after all it does have stephanie beaton this is the reason why i think that it deserves the 10 10 for the pure entertainment of the film br br the general view on this movie is that it has bad acting a simple script that a 10 year old could produce and that it cant be taken seriously and people are rating it low because of this but i see this as a thoroughly entertaining masterpiece that has a hilariously funny script which is made even more entertaining by the actors and although not very serious it is very entertaining
i sat through this turkey because i hadn't seen it before and because the premise sounded like it had potential it was mildly entertaining until the hurricane sequence at the height of the storm the wind is strong enough to blow windows out of the house yet the trees in the background are perfectly upright and not a leaf is moving in fact when the characters move outside the house bright sunlight is visible illuminating the treetops at that point whatever credence the filmmakers had developed evaporated faster than the highly localized rain in their film too bad all hurricanes aren't like this one it would surely help our homeowners insurance rates here in the sunshine state
this is an excellent example of what can be done on a small budget movie the acting is excellent considering the script the whole atmosphere of the film is very foreboding the gore is well done and used sparingly look out for the excellent barbed wire death the action is punchy when used it's true that there are dodgy lines in the script at times but compared to other movies on the same or bigger budget it's hardly noticeable at all overall this is recommended trust me it's better than it appears 8 10
although well past the target audience i've always had a soft spot for ya fiction so i was naturally intrigued by the return of nancy drew to the screen br br this is not a bad film the central mystery involving a long dead actress is presented in straightforward simplistic terms with dashes of jeopardy for the young sleuth nancy and her friends never take the threats seriously so young audience members will not be upset br br what i really appreciated from the story was the final results were rather serious and meaningful and nancy seemed to understand and grow from the experience br br emma roberts is great as nancy drew and hopefully we'll see her again in another mystery
i watched this on an 8 hour flight and presumably because of the pressure and the altitude i actually found it mildly entertaining emphasis on the mild br br the actual idea behind the film was brilliant a woman dies her fiancé falls in love with someone else she decided to make sure they don't get together but eventually she lets them do it sadly the actual film wasn't as good ok there were a few laughs and the actors all worked well but from the beginning the plot was about as predictable as the destination of the flight i was on i think the whole gay but not gay friend part of the story could have been worked a lot better the talking parrot was a nice idea but to be honest it wasn't really very funny br br in summary the film was more interesting than staring at the seat in front of me but it was a close call
this is very much a television version of the tale the film starts out like an episode of 'xena ' with little meaningful dialog or character description it does get a bit more substantive after a while but all characters are still cartoonish br br salma is the exotic beauty richard harris is an evil and sexually repressed frollo fiending to bust a nut up in salma the other characters including quasimodo are quite forgettable br br its also a sorta liberal version of the story frollo is a suppressor of enlightenment ideals like the abbot in 'name of the rose' and quasimodo is a champion of liberty the shadowy side of the quas character is ignored though he does pour liquid led on people he is really only an outsider in that he looks different and enjoys playing with bells more than the average person br br perhaps the film is intended for children but i doubt it considering frollo flogs himself bloody to amend wanting to spank his monkey a mostly uninteresting and forgettable but not awful and sometimes entertaining rendition of the tale
the movie opens with a flashback to doddsville county high school on april fool's day a group of students play a prank on class nerd marty when they are punished for playing said prank they follow up with a bigger prank which par for the course in slasher films involving pranks on class nerds goes ridiculously awry leaving marty simultaneously burned by fire and disfigured by acid for the sake of being thorough fast forward five years where we find members of the student body gathering at the now abandoned high school for their five year class reunion we find out that it is no coincidence that everyone at the reunion belonged to the clique of pranksters from the flashback scene as all of the attendees are being stalked and killed by a mysterious jester mask clad murderer in increasingly complicated and mind numbingly ludicrous fashions it doesn't take sherlock holmes to solve the mystery of the killer's identity as it is revealed to be none other than a scarred marty who has seemingly been using his nerd rage and high intellect to bend the laws of physics and engineering in order to rig the school for his revenge scenario the film takes a turn for the bizarre as marty finishes exacting his revenge on his former tormentors only to be haunted by their ghosts marty is finally pushed fully over the edge and takes his own life finally the film explodes in a crescendo of disjointed weirdness as the whole revenge scenario is revealed to be a dream in the first place as marty wakes up in a hospital bed breaks free of his restraints stabs a nurse and finally disfigures his own face br br the script is tired and suffers from a terminal case of horror movie logic the only originality comes from the mind numbingly convoluted ways that the victims are dispatched the absurd it was all a dream ending feels tacked on it's almost as if someone pointed out the disjointed nature of the film and the writer decided then and there that it was a dream br br technically speaking the film is atrocious some scenes were filmed so dark that i had to pause the film and play with the color on my television the acting is sub par even for slasher films i can't help but think that casting was a part of the problem as all of the actors look at least five years older than the characters they portray which makes the flashback scene even more unintentionally laughable their lack of commitment to the movie is made obvious as half of them can't bother to keep their accents straight through the movie br br all of this being said if you like bad horror movies you might like this one too it isn't the worst film of the genre but it's far from the best
before the release of george romero's genre defining night of the living dead zombies were relatively well behaved creatures they certainly had much better table manners in the old days but social etiquette aside what thrills did these early zombies offer to the movie going public judging by this film none whatsoever br br the story is about an expedition to cambodia whose purpose is to find and destroy the secret of zombiefication one of the party discovers the secrets on his own and sets about building his zombie army br br this film is basically a love triangle with zombies but seeing as this is a 30's movie the said zombies are more like somnambulists than the flesh eating variety we think of today they seem to respond to mind control rather than insatiable appetites and quite frankly the 'revolt' is somewhat underwhelming too the whole thing is really very dull aside from the lack of horror there isn't any over the top melodramatic theatrics to keep us entertained it seems unlikely that this could've provided much entertainment even 70 years ago see it if you have to see everything with 'zombie' in the title but otherwise i would advise skipping this one
lorenzo lamas stars as jack solider kelly an ex vietnam vet and a renegade cop who goes on a search and destroy mission to save his sister from backwoods rednecks atrocious movie is so cheaply made and so bad that ron palillo is third billed and yet has 3 minutes of screen time and even those aren't any good overall a terrible movie but the scenes with lorenzo lamas and josie bell hanging from a tree bagged and gagged are worth a few unintentional laughs followed by an improved sequel
i just saw dick tracy and i thought it was terrible the paintings in the background of the cities looked awful also the mob characters looked too weird warren beatty didn't do an awful job as dick tracy but it was definetely not one of his better performances madonna should just stick to singing glenne headly did a good job in this movie i gave this movie a 2 10 just because of the amazing acting by al pacino it wasn't a high note in his career but he still did a good job
one of those thank god i don't live there documentaries this one tells of two warring factions in colombia guerrillas and paramilitaries and the surrounding peoples of medellin br br guns drugs and death run rampant the guys no older than 22 not in the middle of fighting a war are in jail the girls  not women girls  always react the same way when one of them is killed with tears and screaming you scratch your head what did they expect really i don't know what's more disturbing the nightly shoot outs and civil unrest or that everybody just seems to passively accept things as are or seeing that boy drinking what is obviously not his first beer being all of what 10 if you were to take these any of these young men out of their situation and put them some place where they had the opportunity to do more be more how many would choose not to stay br br based on this documentary all i'm afraid
demi moore's character in the movie was selected for the seals because of her looks that was a bad start and the movie went down from there the plot was totally unbelievable the will to make it in a tough military unit is not enough this movie did not convince me of a woman's physical ability to perform the types of tasks required br br trying to pretend that women and men are basically the same is an insult to everyone's intelligence the differences between the sexes are what makes life interesting
very smart sometimes shocking i just love it it shoved one more side of david's brilliant talent he impressed me greatly david is the best the movie captivates your attention for every second
i'm a belgian and grew up in the sixties most of the us series were shown over here original language with subtitles and batman was one of the first i was keen on unfortunately over here it caused a panic hysteria amongst the mothers because batman was considered as too violent geez compare the innocence of that series to the crap kids get to see nowadays so because of my the over protective mothers from the 60s i only got a chance to see maybe two or three episodes i got so frustrated i started to collect the comics and bubblegum cards still got them to compensate i even got the view master slides i had an urge to see the caped crusader all kids need some kind of hero br br years later i finally got the chance to see the re runs as an adolescent and i enjoyed it tremendously the tongue in cheek acting would have escaped me when i would've watched it as a kid but i understood it at the age of 17 yeah i've watched them all now and the occasional kind soul on the internet posts episodes because they haven't released the series on dvd to my knowledge br br this evening i enjoyed return to the bat cave it was a delight to watch because it was full of trivia and inside jokes to see adam and burt was a delight and this tv movie is simply fantastic in every aspect they play themselves as they played their parts in the series br br congratulations to the people who produced this great nostalgic feast i'm gonna watch it again my advice to all batman fans is see it rent it lend it from a friend buy it i'd never expect myself to rate this as 9 10 very well done
kirstie alley looking a bit slimmer but only a bit is in this mess along with a man who is a macguyver lookalike bleached blond hair and all the premise of the movie is about an older woman 50 who cannot get her screenplay produced due to age discrimination so she sends in her younger nephew to pose as the writer not an original idea and not a very good movie with lousy acting inane dialogue and a ridiculous plot there is another plot concerning a writer with a crush or admiration for kirstie's character and why this is included is a mystery the actor who portrays kirstie's brother is so wooden and miscast it was torture to watch their scenes what is there to say about this film avoid it
i saw this movie in 1976 my first year of living in new york i went on to live there for the next 26 years but never saw anything as delicate and beautiful again as this small tv movie it was part of a pbs series as i recall and i've never forgotten it br br there are no sex scenes to speak of just delicate moving extraordinarily touching moments full of tension and excitement all set within a conservative boston i think world war 1 environment where women played the role of devoted wife awaiting the return of husband from the war and did not seek out a career and financial independence frances lee mccain is superb in the role of career photographer and i have spent the next 30 odd years searching for her in equally challenging roles to no avail br br there has to be a video of this movie sure it should be on dvd but surely at least a video
i have to say although this movie was formulaic throughout with a plot stolen from films like friday the 13th i know what you did last summer this movie wasn't that bad in fact it wasn't as bad as most of the horror films hollywood has released recently the killings although at times a little too imaginative were in most instances just that original the cast was mediocre which is to be expected from low budget features but much better than what that much bigger studio artisan lions gate has been offering my only real complaint that wasn't due to the film's budget which must have been small was the contrived twist ending i'm sorry but this is what put this film in the bad category for me the ending was just stupid and tacked on before that i was a little bored but actually enjoying it 4 10
kol space prisoner on space death row manages to hijack a space shuttle and escape to the woods of america where he along with some new found friend try to escape from the 'alienator a female cyborg killing machine made one year after the best movie of fred olen ray's career hollywood chainsaw hookers this one can't help but feel like a bit of a letdown just as low budget as that earlier film but not nearly as fun as i had with it none of the actors really stood out at me the film is alright for the undiscriminating viewer during a rainy saturday afternoon but that's pretty much all it's good for br br my grade d br br where i saw it showtime thriller
since it has been some years since i reviewed this classic i have decided to go back and review it more in dept but first some insider notes from a movie critic br br this animated series is one of those that i grew up with it made my childhood joyful it made it awesome miss some of this stuff today that we clearly don't see as much as we did back in the days well on to the review br br talespin or luftens helte which it is called in denmark is a great animated series it is much like chip and dale ducktales and a lot of those old ones so it has that weird feeling surrounding it i cannot remember this series as much as i would like to remember it br br but in my opinion it was very great it came with some kind of message not that wild of a message however it is one of the old ones so that can be forgiven br br now i don't want to sound old or anything but i feel like time slipped out of my hands with these cartoons today we see something like ed edd and eddy or anything else weird like that we have all these new or nearly new shows like hannah montana or something like that yet i feel like that we don't have the same spirit in cartoons or real shows like we did in the early days br br now maybe i am wrong but i feel like time has changed to much to conclude i would be thrilled to see these series like talespin being released again to the tv screen instead of all the new ones give me back my childhood cartoons give them to the kids i have some day give them again
oh man why six degrees is a show about this so called theory that we all are linked by someone if focus on the lives of a group of people and the consequences of their actions br br when i first heard of this show it didn't caught my attention at all it seemed too ordinary actually then i saw some episodes and loved it first of all the characters they are all well written and different from each other there's a alcohol addicted a woman whose fiancée cheats on her a woman who just lost her husband a driver who has a troubled brother and so on unlike what we're used to most of the characters interact with each other in casualties like in our daily routines great my favourite ones are mae carlos and whitney br br then the cast they are all great jay hernandez from hostel shows here his acting habilities in a more 3d character than his previous work as paxton the other ones give great performances too specially campbell scott who plays steven and bridget moynahan who plays whitney br br well when i came to imdb after watching some episodes i couldn't believe that it got cancelled seriously i can't understand the low ratings br br it's too bad it didn't have more than one season it would really be a good show to follow
i thought i should qualify my position after reading other reviews the movie is not great but it has a lot of great elements the lighting and scenes along with the camera work are great the story is slow and weak but entertaining the acting is bad but no worse than you will find on the syfy channel the music is pretty good and the gore is good it has the great leather face in the film and is produced by bruce campbell i watched the complete movie and while mostly predictable it was still enjoyable the women are attractive enough and the lead actor does a good job of being brooding and creepy the movie was remarkably clean for a modern film and the violence appropriate for children 13 and up there was no sex scenes i gave it 7 out of 10 and i think that is fair i would watch it again if i had nothing better to do the gay sounding angel was the most annoying aspect of the film the devil is quite creepy
lost is the best tv series there is first of all it has great actors and wonderful directing the writing is a very controversial issue because in the first two seasons the writing was extraordinary but after season 3 the writing became highly complex for instance who is jacob why are there polar bears on the island what's the fog how did the island disappear who is richard alpert a lot of people think that the writers are lost and that they have raised a lot of questions and mysteries that they can't explain i believe these people are wrong i have confidence in the writers i think that if the mysteries are revealed from now all the charm of the series will be gone anyway lost is undeniably the greatest tv series and it will continue to be for a long time
this is a german film from 1974 that is something to do with some women who come to a castle and beyond that i can't really tell you their purpose or even what the purpose of the movie is i can tell you that there's several women who also moonlight as servants at this particular castle who strip put on body paint and gyrate to bongos like they were at the goth kit kat klub though and that seems to be a good portion of the run time of this film yeah there seems to be something with devil worship and vampires and there's some girl on girl stuff etc but the main focus seems to be the painted babes gyrating away in the basement i did rather like the eye rolling of one of the main housekeepers devil worshipers that lent an authenticity to the proceedings and made her even more evil looking was that wanda the evil lesbian as billed in the credits no matter if you aren't too picky about your lesbian devil worshiping movies you might like this otherwise it's pretty dull stuff and i couldn't even finish it i was so bored 3 out of 10
although i had heard this film was a little dry i watch whatever scott bakula is in at the start of this film i had high hopes for the classic cheesy but enjoyable scott gets girl ending and until 20 minutes before the end it was going great the plot twist was crazy and unexpected and very clever i kept my fingers crossed that it would work out and it would all be some horrible misunderstanding right up until when the credits rolled and i realised that there was not going to be a happy and contented ending unfortunately i was left regretting that i'd watched it and hurriedly putting on some quantum leap to restore my faith in the goodness of the great scott
as is often the case films about self loathing characters do not usually make for good drama 'downloading nancy' is no exception it's supposedly based on a true story about a woman who's murdered at her own request by someone she meets over the internet br br the protagonist is nancy maria bello who is married to albert rufus sewell albert is a successful software developer who has developed a golf game which his company has successfully marketed to various bars and bar restaurants unlike most human beings albert has virtually no positive attributes except for his ability to be successful in the business world throughout the film albert has a grim and dour expression on his face he has no sympathy for his wife with all her emotional problems and resorts to patronizing prostitutes when his wife asks for sex he punishes her by masturbating in her presence instead br br nancy is equally one note as a character not only has she had a loveless 15 year marriage but was sexually abused by her uncle when she was growing up thankfully there are no flashbacks of that back story in the film her self loathing takes the form of self mutilation and a result she's forced into therapy however she has such contempt for her therapist that no progress can be made br br finally nancy is so depressed that she contacts louis over the internet he's sort of a sadomasochistic gigolo who has sex with women for money while inflicting massive amounts of pain to boot it's revealed that louis has two children but no longer sees them the children's mother no longer wants anything to do with him br br nancy's plan is to first have painful sex with louis and then have him kill her there's a particularly unpleasant scene where louis has sex with nancy while slashing her vaginal area with a broken piece of glass these scenes are shown as flashbacks after louis pays a visit to albert who ties him up and strikes him with a golf club it seems that louis has a two fold plan in going to see albert 1 berate him for his treatment of nancy and 2 enjoy the beating he receives it takes awhile before louis will reveal nancy's fatefirst he forces albert to do him the favor of taking his dog to a relative so someone will care for it in the future nancy's fate of course is that louis finally ended up choking her to death but showed some hesitation first as he made it clear that he had some 'feelings' for her we soon learn that louis is imprisoned for life for nancy's murder br br what exactly are we to take away from a film such as downloading nancy are we supposed to feel sorry for victims of sexual abuse and domestic violence is that the main point of the film is sympathy for nancy actually warranted i don't think so the film's writers create a straw man in the character of albertsomeone who is so cut off from his emotions that he is the one that is held responsible for nancy's decline but are people so one dimensional in real life i think not they have the repulsive louis a man who makes a living by inflicting pain come over and berate albert for neglecting nancy furthermore his expressions of love towards nancy before he kills her is supposed to show his 'sensitive side' br br in the end it matters little whether the filmmakers have defined where their sympathies lie with the various characters in the film they are so bent on titillating their audience with scenes of gratuitous violence that downloading nancy becomes nothing more than an exercise in poor taste and soft pornography
i admit not being that fond of oliver as a young child it's long and the story is a little slow moving because of all the musical numbers as a teenager i discovered that the fun of this movie is the experience itself rather than thinking of it as an adaptation of oliver twist think of it as a celebration of the classic story the adaptation is loose at best but really if you're watching a musical you ain't there for the story br br the music is the core of this movie and an overwhelming majority of it is stellar and very catchy most or all of the cast was involved in the stage version of the musical and it shows in their performances and i consider this a plus the performances are all in a more stagey style of acting typical of much older films and they are very entertaining the exception is the kid playing oliver whose job seemed to be to look cute and stay out of the real performers' way br br fagin and the dodger are the real stars of this movie oliver reed also does a fantastic job maintaining an intimidating screen presence as the menacing bill sykes even sykes' dog bullseye puts on a good performance br br this movie isn't for everyone people who hate musicals will despise it as will those who take musicals too seriously nitpicking over faulty historical details or mistaking exaggerated stage type acting for bad acting will ruin anyone's enjoyment just sit back and enjoy the entertainment it's much better if you remember that as a musical it's a fantasy loosely organized around the book not a strict adaptation
i didn't really go into reign over me knowing exactly what to expect either from the director or the story the plot was easy enough to understand i suppose this guy's whole family died in 9 11 and he shuts the world out of his life alright i didn't know if it was going to use the attachment of terrorism as a platform to speak on that or other issues relating to it and it really doesn't on a very obvious level so if you're scared to be surrounded by political opinions that may be different from yours i wouldn't worry about it i think the writing even made a point never to explicitly mention september the eleventh br br overall i was impressed it was a very moving picture the movie has a sense of humor and it is very sharp but it is definitely a drama where it counts i typically don't like to think that comedic actors are incapable of actually acting but sometimes let's be honest they are adam sandler is definitely capable of it and though i think so you may disagree jim carrey is also very well rounded sometimes sandler's portrayal of charlie fineman took a character that on the surface seems completely unreal and makes it become absolutely believable i read many reviews that criticized the writing of alan johnson's don cheadle in another excellent role if not one that seems similar to a few of his more recent pictures wife who is played well by jada pinkett smith calling her static and dull but that is completely untrue br br she has depth but some of it gets hidden behind the main story which does drift in and out of focus occasionally which also brings to mind some very unusual transitions done early in the movie with a weird make everything out of focus fadeout after about the first 40 minutes they aren't used anymore maybe it's significant for the characters outlook artistically or maybe they just realized how irritating it was the film gradually begins to reveal to us the point one of several but definitely the most explicit of the story which is that sometimes people have to deal with grief in their own way maybe it seems unorthodox to us maybe it seems downright unhealthy but maybe what some people want more than anything is just to forget to just exist the films soundtrack was excellent and it used music to pursue and amplify moods rather than establish them which gives credit to the actors and the writers br br the movie takes it's name from the song love reign o'er me off of the who's rock opera quadrophenia the song itself is fairly insignificant to the actual story but it is used powerfully in the movie over the course of the climax and at the very end the movie is paced well and does not feel like it's dragging anywhere in it's length which is a little over 2 hours if you can accept adam sandler's portrayal of this deeply heartbroken and broken down man you will enjoy the movie you will become entangled in the story and you will genuinely feel for the characters in every minute of it it is not the best movie of the year and there's nothing groundbreaking or positively amazing in it but it's a very enjoyable watchable movie all in all
saying a film is depressing isn't necessarily a bad thing i'm very willing to watch a depressing film if there is a point to be made and this one certainly has one it's the often heartbreaking story of a chinese man and his family as they experience many years of both hardship and plenty but i must warn you that this might just be about the most depressing film to come out of hollywood in the 1930s because peasant life in china was tough to say the least be prepared to watch segments about famine death and disease br br about the only negative other than the persistent tone of misery is that the lead is played by paul muni while he was an exceptionally talented man it's just a real shame that hollywood always cast people of european descent to play asian leads during this era if you are paying attention at all it's pretty obvious that muni is wrong for the part
i stumbled upon nine dead recently and read the current reviews thinking i could deal with an average movie this movie however was slightly below average yet watchable the script was poorly written and the acting was at average for a b level movie with a couple standing out as pretty good the plot borders on that of saw teach people what they did wrong in a situation and try to make them appreciate life more but that is really where the comparison ends nine dead tries to have heart and purpose behind simple ideas that are not new the main fault that i found in nine dead was the slap in the face to the viewer of flashbacks that occurred 3 minutes before in the film and were completely unnecessary and a completely inadequate ending that people won't see coming in a bad way barring any spoilers i have seen the worse of bad movies and even they didn't end this poorly decent flick bad acting and ending though
i love midnight cowboy and have it in my video collection as it is a favorite of mine what is interesting to me is how when midnight cowboy came out in 1969 it was so shocking to viewers that it was rated x of course at that time x meant maturity since i was only two years old at the time of the movie's release it is hard for me to imagine just how shocked viewers were back then however when i try to take into account that many of the topics covered in the film which included prostitution the title itself was slang for a male prostitute homosexuality loneliness physical and to some extent emotional as well abuse and drugs are hard for many people to talk about to this day i can begin to get a sense of what viewers of this movie thought back on its release it is worth noting that in the 1970's midnight cowboy was downgraded to an r rating and even though it is still rated r some of the scenes could almost be rated pg 13 by today's standards br br i want to briefly give a synopsis of the plot although it is probably known to almost anyone who has heard of the movie jon voight plays a young man named joe buck from texas who decides that he can make it big as a male hustler in new york city escorting rich women he emulates cowboy actors like roy rogers by wearing a cowboy outfit thinking that that will impress women after being rejected by all the women he has come across he meets a sleazy con man named enrico ratso rizzo who is played by dustin hoffman ratso convinces joe that he can make all kinds of money if he has a manager once again joe is conned and before long is homeless however joe comes across ratso and is invited to stay in a dilapidated apartment without giving away much more of the plot i want to say that the remainder of the movie deals with joe and ratso as they try to help one another in an attempt to fulfill their dreams i e joe making it as a gigolo and ratso going down to florida where he thinks he can regain his health br br i want to make some comments about the movie itself first of all the acting is excellent especially the leads although the movie is really very sad from the beginning to the end there are some classic scenes in fact there are some scenes that while they are not intended to be funny i find them amusing for example there is the classic scene where dustin hoffman and jon voight are walking down a city street and a cab practically runs them over dustin hoffman bangs on the cab and says hey i'm walkin' here i'm walkin' here i get a kick out of that scene because it is so typical of new york city where so many people are in a hurry another scene that comes to mind is the scene where ratso dustin hoffman sends joe jon voight to a guy named o'daniel what is amusing is that at first we think o'daniel is there to recruit gigolos and can see why joe is getting so excited but then we begin to realize that o'daniel is nothing but a religious nut in addition to the two scenes i mentioned i love the scene where ratso and joe are arguing in their apartment when ratso says to joe that his cowboy outfit only attracts homosexuals and joe says in self defense john wayne you gonna tell me he's a fag what i like is the delivery in that scene br br i would say that even though midnight cowboy was set in the late '60's much of it rings true today that's because although the area around 42nd street in new york has been cleaned up in the form of disneyfication in the last several years homelessness is still just as prevalent there now as it was 40 years ago also many people have unrealistic dreams of how they are going to strike it big only to have their dreams smashed as was the case with the jon voight character one thing that impresses me about jon voight's character is how he is a survivor and i felt that at the end of the movie he had matured a great deal and that ratso dustin hoffman's character was a good influence on him br br in conclusion i want to say that i suggest that when watching this movie one should watch it at least a couple of times because there are so many things that go on for example there are a bunch of flashback and dream sequences that made more sense to me after a couple of viewings also what i find interesting is that there is a lot in this movie that is left to interpretation such as what really happened with joe buck jon voight's character and the people who were in his life in texas even the ending while i don't want to give it away for those who have not seen the movie is rather open ended
ok i caught this film halfway through but oh dear god it sounds like they're all reading from scripts br br especially that guy who is now in teachers and the book group although at least he has proved that he can act if he wants to the part where someone has a heart attack stands out as a bastion of bad film making both in terms of acting scripting and general plausibility it quite clearly appears to be a cash in on human traffic but whilst that is not the best film ever it is at least original and had actors whose delivery did not resemble that of earnest yet hopeless gcse students trying to get a pass grade not so much as human traffic as a bit of a car crash
can we say retarded this girl has no talent what so ever nothing but complete garbage you people are just marking 10 stars because you know most people hate this pathetic woman if its such a great show then why did it get canceled after 6 measly episodes exactly people that support her please seek help you do not know what is funny her stand up comedy is just so stupid seriously how do you find this trash funny the show tries to poke fun at stereo types and other things that are not funny at all carlos mencia is funny and to that stupid poster he actually has fans and his show is on the air so i'm sorry your a redneck who doesen't get his jokes please give me my 20 minutes of my life back
for 50 years after world war 2 the united states was in a state where key segments of the economy were dominated by military interests at the same time because of the draft and wars everyone in society had served or was connected to someone who had br br this allowed for a minigenre based on the notion of american cleverness in the midst of an inflexible military machine sometimes that machine was non us military for example in prisoner of war situations once removed are stories in other machines science fiction and corporate but they always reference this military genre and indeed the testosterone shots of action even reference their comic sibling br br you can trace it i think perhaps starting in the comic meaning amrican sections of the great escape which immediately spawned teevee offspring in gomer pyle and hogan's heros then a second wave triggered by catch 22 and mash both of which had been real life then books then movies and in the mash case then teevee br br but before all that there was the phil silvers show about a sergeant bilko and this followed from mister roberts a happy con man who only committed harmless crimes and then only as response to an overly crude system which attempted to limit his life this was in the day when teevee shows mattered you absorbed them instead of merely carrying them to work to chatter about it wasn't particularly clever in any way except in finding that crack between what we wanted in control and freedom br br its one large zone where americans worked out how they think about forgivable even endearing lies in a military context a zone that has been appropriated by one of our political parties here br br because its big it sometimes pays off in laughs stripes was pretty darn funny i thought it had the twist of the misfits actually defeating serious foes sort of folding in some dirty dozen and sexual adventure br br now this well before the cultural wars escalated it tries to touch that sweet spot like other remakes that manhandled steve martin it is so unfunny you actually root for the army to be the stronger player yet another way to track how societies work out the handles on military power br br ted's evaluation 1 of 3 you can find something better to do with this part of your life
i have seen about a thousand horror films my favorite type this film is among the worst for me an idea drives a movie so even a poorly acted cheaply made movie can be good something weird is definitely cheaply made however it has little to say i still don't understand what the karate scene in the beginning has to do with the film something weird has little to offer save yourself the pain
this movie is really funny the general is keaton's finest work but there are many of his works that are more hilarious in this one are multiple sight gags and creative humor we watch it over and over and it only seems to get funnier
not worth the video rental or the time or the occasional efforts br br makeup that a child can do acting was over done poor directing editing was very choppy many things made no sense or just seemed gratuitous sound was badly dubbed music was highly inappropriate casting was extremely off must have been on crack zombies that talk let alone drive dance work just pisses me off and the bad guy holy crap as horribly casted as he was he was the best looking zombie of all which doesn't say much br br the cover art was good but very deceiving as was the main menu of the dvd great artwork and music br br don t bother
reviews for this film were lukewarm at best while expectations were sky high a big budget tons of popular faces a rather funny idea and a main actress everyone loves the end result is a disaster alice tremblay's supposedly humorous journey in fantasy world fails in every way to entertain it's audience i didn't hear a single laugh throughout the entire presentation going through it's page thin story line and one dimensional characters without a single spark not a sign of the magic it wished it had the 90 minutes of film here are sterile with clumsy direction and some good actors doing their best to come of as professionals in a feature that certainly couldn't seem that great an idea on the set let alone on paper 'l'odyssée d'alice tremblay' is a collage of comic sketches linked together with a very thin layer of good ideas avoid or boredom will haunt you
this was a great movie that had a lot of under lying issues it dealt with issues of rascism and class but it also had a message of knowing yourself and taking responsibility for yourself this movie was very deep it gave the message of that you and only you can control your destiny it also showed that knowing yourself and being comfortable with who you are is the only way you will ever fit into society what others think of you is not important i believe this movie did a wonderful job of showing it the actors i think were able to convey each character wonderfully i just thought it was amazing how deep this movie really was at a just glancing look you wouldn't see how deep the movie is but on further look you see the underlining meaning of the movie
ugh what can i say other than ugh i rented this film because it was labeled as a sequel to the original vampires this movie could not have been any lamer lacking not only in plot but the acting is atrocious combined with some obvious plot holes makes this movie a very hard one to watch many times i questioned my own sanity at continuing to watch the film long after the plot had jumped the shark here's a sampling of the lamer aspects br br spoilers br br professional slayer insists on sleeping outdoors by himself at night he wakes up to a woman crying sitting no more than 3 feet from him in the middle of nowhere he immediately goes to comfort her without questioning her sudden appearance she goes from crying to seducing him and he lets it happen with obvious results br br one of the main characters is zoe was bitten by a vampire but as long as she takes these experimental pills she got in mexico city she's fine although her body temperature is below room temperature br br guard outside of monastery where hero is staying the night is killed by vampires hero leaves the next day he then returns a day later only to be surprised that the vampires attacked the monastery the night after he left br br avoid this movie
i'm not sure under what circumstances director visconti decided to film james cain's novel the postman always rings twice i'm not even sure if viscounti acquired the book's rights but the resulting movie is definitely interesting it is not the best version of cain's story i like the 1981 version best but thanks to visconti's excellent direction and the casting of clara calamai and massimo girotti a very sensual couple it is a must for noir fans visconti mixes neorealism with noir sensibilities to great effect the film is not perfect though my main complaint is that the film is a little too long for its own good the story moves at a very slow pace i don't think visconti was very good at editing his films i think film noir works better with a short running time fortunately calamai and girotti are magnetic actors that keep the viewer interested anyhow as much as i like this film and the remakes i think no one has made the definitive version of cain's much praised book
kate beckinsale is as good if not better than gwyneth paltrow as emma in this movie although i really liked gwyneth paltrow in the other emma version they're both good in different ways kate beckinsale as emma seems more interesting almost though and i liked the woman who played harriet smith in this movie better too she was more believably sweet and sentimental there are certain things i like better about the gwyneth paltrow version though like how the humorous side is more apparent
this movie barely followed the story line of the movie all of the fascinating points in the book didn't even exist in the movie they ended up turning it into a cheesy tween disney movie crush story between meg and calvin it was so bad it should have been hillary duff playing the part or one of the likes this movie was nothing more than an insult to the intelligence and mysticism of the book i can't believe disney could even get away with making such a cheap basic rendition if you've ever read the book i think you would agree it could easily be made into a movie of lord of the rings equivalence this movie should have never been able to use the title of a wrinkle in time poorly done
of all the kung fu films made through the 70's and 80's this is one that has developed a real cult following with the exception of all the films bruce lee starred in this is a film that has stood the test of time and its due to the unique story an aging kung fu master tells his last pupil yang tieh sheng chiang about five pupils he has trained in the past all five wore masks and nobody has seen the face of each other and they have all been trained differently their specialty in kung fu is the name they have adopted like lizard snake centipede toad and scorpion the master called them the poison clan and he does not know what has happened to them so he wants tieh to find them and help the ones that are doing good to stop the others that are evil an old man who was once a member of the poison clan has a map to where he has hidden a lot of money and he seems to be a target tieh does not know what they look like so he has to mingle in society and try and figure out who they are tieh has discovered that the snake is hung wen tung pai wei and along with tang sen kue feng lu who is the centipede they kill a family to find the map a map is found by a mystery man who turns out to be the scorpion but know one knows who he is a local policeman named ho yung sin philip kwok investigates the murders along with his partner ma chow chien sun sin has a friend called li ho meng lo who is the toad and they do know of each others identity the snake bribes the local officials to pin the murders on li ho and while he is in prison he is tortured and killed when sin finds out he teams up with tieh and together they go to combat tung and kue br br this film was directed by cheh chang and he was a very special director when it came to these films chang was not your run of the mill kung fu director and his films always had a special quality to them while most martial arts films deal with revenge chang did not use that as a central theme even though there is some revenge going on later in this story this film is more complex than that five men trained by the same master in different ways and wearing masks then they are all in the same area and not knowing who the other is very unique story makes this film different from all the others and most of changs stories were in a class all by themselves i wouldn't exactly put it in the same league as enter the dragon because bruce lee was a worldwide icon and the martial arts he exhibited were more authentic looking this film still has some impossible feats like clinging to sides of walls and all the flipping through the air but this film isn't necessarily about fight scenes its more about the intrigue of the story and the characters that are involved that alone makes this different from all the other kung fu films very well made with a unique story
this movie was one of the funniest movie i've seen in years and the laughs from the audience members support me not since my big fat greek wedding 2002 has the laughter been as spontaneous and intense easily has intricate as last year's mr and mrs smith 2005 in its use of parody espionage in mr and mrs smith and sex in my super ex girlfriend director's ivan reitman balance between comedy and drama between crazy and downright ludicrous is great never does the shock and dramatic serious crack the rule of comedy at the same time this predictable romantic comedy never loses its touching emotional elements even if the ending is broadcast in advance in some ways it's so evident that it's great to see how it plays out just like in real life sometimes the truth is so evident that one can't really see it easily eight out of ten stars ranking up there with tootsie 1982 possibly a nine depends on how it appears on a second viewing
after witnessing his wife linda hoffman engaging in sexual acts with the pool boy the already somewhat unstable dentist dr feinstone corbin bernsen completely snaps which means deep trouble for his patients br br this delightful semi original and entertaining horror flick from director brian yuzna was a welcome change of pace from the usual horror twaddle that was passed out in the late nineties although the dentist' is intended to be a cheesy fun little film yuzna ensures that the movie delivers the shocks and thrills that many more serious movies attempt to dispense despite suffering somewhat from the lack of background on the central characters and thus allowing events that should have been built up to take place over a couple of days the movie is intriguing generally well scripted and well paced which allows the viewer to maintain interest even during the more ludicrous of moments the dentist' suffers on occasion from dragging but unlike the much inferior 1998 sequel there are only sporadic uninteresting moments and in general the movie follows itself nicely br br corbin bernsen was very convincing in the role of the sadistic deranged and perfectionist dr alan feinstone the way bernsen is able to credibly recite his lines especially with regards to the foulness and immorality of sex particularly fellatio is something short of marvellous while many actors may have trouble portraying a cleanliness obsessed psycho without it coming off as too cheesy or ridiculous bernsen seems to truly fit the personality of the character he attempts to portray and thus makes the film all that more enjoyable had the dentist' not been intended to be a fun almost comical horror movie bernsen's performance would probably have been much more powerful sadly the rest of the cast including a pre fame mark ruffalo failed to put in very good performances and although the movie was not really damaged by this stronger performances could have added more credibility to the flick br br the dentist' is not a horror film that is meant to be taken seriously but is certainly enjoyable particularly i would presume for fans of cheesy horror those who became annoyed at the number of scream' 1996 clones from the late nineties may very well find this a refreshing change as i did a seldom dull and generally well paced script as well as some proficient direction helps to make the dentist' one of the more pleasurable cheesy horrors from the 1990's on top of this we are presented with some particularly grizly and on the whole realistic scenes of dental torture which should keep most gorehounds happy far from perfect but far from bad as well the dentist' is a flick that is easily worth watching at least once my rating for the dentist'  6 5 10
i wouldn't give this movie a rating it's not worthy i watched it only because i'm a pfieffer fan i love her and would watch anything she made even in this dud she didn't disappoint every scene with her in it kept the viewer watching waiting for something to happen but nothing ever did it had some good story lines but they ended abruptly as soon as it started some of the other characters had potential but nothing became of it br br pfieffer was 29 when she made this film and at her most lovely the wardrobe and set was surprisingly good br br i can watch mostly anything and rarely come across a movie i can't find something to like about it but this was a dud i don't understand br br the worst thing about it all it had a big cliff hanger at the end it had an ending scene that woke you up and say wow this film is finally going some place then the credits roll good grief br br i agree with the review that said 99 would have bought 3 cans of cat food and watching my cat eat would have been more exciting well said actually that comment was more entertaining than the film because it sums it up so well i too wasted 99 cents on this dud dud dud
this movie seems to send the wrong message there can be morality without using christ poeple of other religions i believe can get into heaven i am a catholic who goes to church every week but i do not agree with such christian arrogance this is the worst time travel movie i have ever seen and i've seen timeline
this is probably the worst movie i have ever seen yes it's even worse than dungeons and dragons and any film starring kevin costner br br chris rock looked very uncomfortable throughout this whole film and his supporting actors didn't even look like they were trying to act chris rock is a wonderful stand up comedian but he just can't transfer his talent to this film which probably only has two strained laughs in the whole picture br br if you haven't watched this film yet avoid it like the plague go do something constructive and more interesting like watching the weather channel or watching paint dry on a brick wall br br for chris' efforts i give it a 2 10 br br
well what can it be said about this disaster i watched it because it aired on cable i regret for wasting my time but at least i didn't waste money br br the creature is the cheesiest you can get please you need to be very generous not to get angered by the cheap halloween costume oh well there are also displays of horrible acting f x and dialogues the confrontation with the creature is unbelievable you can't get a more pathetic scene br br this is the worst you can get from direct to video flicks creature unknown makes full moon pictures movies look like halloween br br avoid this one at all costs please the only positive thing about this trash are the sexy women
roommates sugar and bobby lee are abducted by menacing dudes while out shopping one day and taken back to a secluded island that the girls reluctantly tell the thugs that they last visited when they were ten years of age and that a fortune is located on all that just pretty much bookends a movie that is pretty much one long flashback about the girls first visit to the island and subsequent fight with a cannibalistic family br br this one is extremely horribly acted by everyone involved to the point that i started feeling bad for poor hank worden who truly deserved much much better as much as i didn't like barracuda that's on the same dvd i have to admit that this film makes that one look like citizen kane br br eye candy one pair of tits they might belong to kirsten baker br br my grade f br br dark sky dvd extras vintage ads for various drive in food and trailers for bonnie's kids features nudity the centerfold girls part time wife features nudity psychic killer eaten alive the dvd also comes with 1978's barracuda
this movie is an insult to all submariners it was stupid it appeared to have been written by monkeys the acting was absurd if this is the view most people have of the navy then i weep for our defense this movie was awful i put it below voyage to the bottom of the sea as far as submarine movies go gene hackman must have really needed rent money to do this crap denzel washington must have been high little in the plot makes any sense and the ending for a mutineer to be rewarded for his crime only hollywood would think of this garbage if you haven't figured it out yet i didn't like it and if it wasn't for all the pro comments i would not have bothered to post
the film adaptation of james joyce's ulysses is excellent the actors the voice overs the direction it all captures the feel of the novel without sacrificing its own merits the milo o'shea does an excellent job as leopold bloom the cuckolded man married to the sassy molly i absolutely love this picture
steve chris hoffman gathers a group from high school for a reunion at the cabin location where his twin brother wes went missing while they are there a reptilian creature in the shape of a man reminded me a lot of the gillman from creature from the black lagoon awaits in the wilderness choosing the right time to pick them apart one by one a biker ellen ripley type time female bad ass kat chase masterson has an underground military bunker she practices experiments in while it also serves as a place of safety from the thing on the bloody rampage kat knows more than she's telling she also suffered the loss of a child but there's another novelty twist most of the group have no idea of this creature might just be more human than they realize and it's former identity might shed some light on a deception only one other person has been hiding since wes' death kat holds the key to many of the mysteries that unlock as the group remains near the cabin br br thankfully a large portion of the film stays away from the creature which leaps in the air while we also see a hazy screen when we look through it's eyes the film has dawson's creek type melodramatics which often hinder any real tension that needs to build in a little monster movie the direction is very bland leading to a relatively dull experience instead of eliciting scares the cast is rather life less and uninteresting pretty maggie grace the fog remake might be the only draw for this film
this movie made me really mad because the main characters or all the characters have a southern accent i've lived in iowa for 29 years and i know that people don't have a southern accent here this movie is about a guy who does meth and i don't know the real plot or what the movie is suppose to be about it has some pretty graphic drug use in it and it's really insulting so see these people use meth like it was sugar i lost my brother to meth and this movie makes me sick to my stomach because it glamorizes the drug the movie makes it look cool to use the drug but i was happy at the end when the guy almost made it across the state line i also know that most women who experience a traumatic rape don't want to make love to their boyfriend or husband the next day the movie is just wrong in all directions i would suggest the basketball diaries if i was going to suggest a movie about drugs
of course you could never go into a theatre and witness the types of sets you get in this film from that point of view it is utter fantasy but who cares it is certainly true that you will not find this film listed in with citizen kane battleship potyomkin and all the other films the pseuds tell us we should be watching films like this are worth a hundred citizen kanes it is about what cinema does best great camera work great settings and great performances br br the three spectacular scenes at the end are probably best in the order they are presented keeping the best till last br br i will gladly watch this film again and again and again and
thanks to the bbc for this show i used to suffer from an inferiority complex i hated leaving the house talking to new people and i had an overwhelming sense that people hated me however after watching one episode of 4 non blondes my fortunes started to change after episode 2 i started applying for new jobs wearing fashionable clothes and i actually felt talented when the series had finished i was running the sales department at work banging a plethora of women and frequently won the karaoke competition down my local if you ever have a confidence crisis and don't know where to turn then take a trip down to poundland and pick up the dvd it's only 99p
why panic never got a good theatrical release is easily seen it's much too smart and audiences would have probably had a difficult time with it comparing it to american beauty in its probing of a midlife crisis and sopranos and analyze this in it's study of illegal goings on amidst family life though panic may seem to derive from unoriginal material brommel's lifelike characters coupled with deft dialogue and observant direction make the film a realistic look at the undoing of a middle aged man br br william h macy stars as alex a hitman who works for his father's sutherland contract killing business he leads a double life with his wife ullman and son unaware of his real trade in his middle age he becomes increasingly disgusted with what he has done all his life under his calm collected facade stirs repressed resentment for his father's controlling grasp on his life when he meets a young woman campbell he feels invigored and decides it's time to quit the family business br br the fact that writer director henry brommel decided to make the profession his main character was trying to break away from contract killing is disposable he could have easily substituted it with any undesirable profession his characters are so well developed and believable scenes handled so smoothly and realisticly and dialogue written so insightfully and naturally that the focus falls on macy's conflicted character rather than his job as a hitman brommel's script feels like a shakespearean tragedy with a definite theme of destiny running throughout br br in alex macy creates a tragic easily sympathetic character and turns in yet another brooding great performance as can always be expected donald sutherland is also effectively abrasive and abusive as his overbearing father and ullman's dramatic turn as macy's wife is a welcome change for the comedian consider a scene in a bicycle shop where her mood subtly darkens and peaks in an affecting scene of emotional confusion br br henry brommel's first feature panic is a film that is well crafted in its sincerity with a first rate cast a plausible script terse dialogue and nice direction this character study is hopefully just a taste of brommel's aptness for creating characters that seem real br br 8 out of 10
this makes the third errol morris movie i've seen and i'm increasingly not liking his style he seems to find very interesting and varied characters great personalities to create documentaries for and then with tongue in cheek editing make fun of everything they are about it's never really a direct caricaturation of them and morris seems most of the time to be saying but no no these people are really fascinating really but there's always these subtle little canted angles and not so subtle editing techniques that show that morris seems to be mocking them behind their back br br this movie tracks four people who break the traditional boundaries of organic separation a man who studies african hairless molerats to find that they are amazingly ant like a lion tamer a man who keeps a garden full of animal shaped shrubbery and a robot designer the general theme of the film seems to revolve around the question of what designates animal human and life features so the title of fast cheap out of control doesn't really seem to mean anything in terms of the movie right except of course morris seems just a little disturbed by these individuals' passions he might call them obsessions making synthetic designs on life i share not that fear and honestly don't appreciate some of the connections morris makes in the film br br but i stress his subtlety with no voice over narration and leaving the words entirely to the interviewees it's not as if morris ever pounds that anxiety onto the spectators' collective head instead he mixes circus footage and ant footage together often at times when they're taken out of the context of the circus and the ants showing a sort of collective absurdity behind what all of these people are talking about i don't find them absurd i find them all very neat and interesting individuals br br unless of course he didn't intend such juxtapositions which means he's just a bad craftsman instead of a silent subverter considering none of this films i've seen so far have particularly impressed me i don't really care to find out what he's trying to do br br polarisdib
this is a superbly imaginative low budget sci fi movie from cult director vincenzo natali the film plays out like a crossing of phillip k dick with hitchcock and cronenberg and the film takes on a unique feel like nothing you would have seen the film is superbly shot i love the cinematography in this it feels fresh and original plot wise the film explores similar themes to films like total recall dark city and the matrix and its pretty staple sci fi stuff morgan sullivan jeremy northam is a suburbanite who is bored with his life and has decided to take a job as a company spy for digicorp a large technological corporation he meets up with a recruitment officer at the beginning who brings sullivan on board and instructs him on what he has to do it basically involves going to conferences of rival companies and recording them via a satellite transmission device disguised as a pen it also means that he must take on a different persona and keep it a secret from his wife after his first job things become strange his habits change his personality begins to differ and he suffers pains in his neck and headaches as well as nightmares he encounters a beautiful woman named rita foster played by an intriguingly cast lucy liu he takes an instant attraction to however when he goes in his next job and sees her again she reveals herself to be an agent of some sort who reveals that his job is not quite what it seems he finds out later on that he and the rest of the people attending the conference all work for digicorp the conferences are all covers to allow the company men to brainwash their spies sullivan whose alternate name is jack thursby has been given an antidote to digicorps drugging and while the rest of the spies at the latest conference drift off into what seems like a brain dead day dream while the speakers drone on the speakers send all the attendants to sleep via subliminal messages suddenly the rooms lights turn off and workers at digicorp come in shining lights in all the occupants eyes to ensure they are not conscious and then in a fairly nightmarish situation they bring in head sets for each member which send messages into the brain and brainwash the precipitants into believing they are someone else digicorp are using these people as puppets and creating personalities and lives for these people while wiping their own existence sullivan now must pretend that he entirely believes he is now jack thursby digicorp want to steal information from their rivals samways and they want their own puppets to do it they now effectively control what these spies do except for sullivan when samways get a hold of sullivan and discover he has not actually been brainwashed they decide to use him as a pawn to spy on digicorp make sullivan a double agent they know that digicorp have sent thursby to them to work his way into samways and work his way up the system until he can get into a situation to download important company information that could shut the company down samways realises he had been planted and decide they will play along with digicorp and allow thursby to infiltrate their databanks but they will give digicorp a dodgy disc that will ruin their system the plot begins to twist and turn as both companies are using sullivan as a pawn he is stuck in the middle and rita foster is a mystery as he tries to work out why she is helping him when a mysterious third party becomes involved the person it is revealed that foster works for sullivan must decide whether to go to this freelance agent who could guarantee him a new life and safety or to stick with one of the companies he works for the tension all builds to a stonking climax as it seems just about everyone wants to dispose of him once his usefulness has expires the cast are great northam is superb and the subtlety in his performance is excellent he brings a great visual aspect to his performance his eyes tell a story and we see a great subtle change as his character changes from sullivan to thursby lucy liu is just sexy beyond belief and her presence gives a great dynamic to the film because it seems strange casting but works because of that fact the rest of the cast are also good br br director natali whose previous film was the cult classic sci fi flick cube has a real visual flair he paces the film superbly as well and has given it a great look for a low budget film it features some imaginative visual effects and although the cgi isn't great it never begins too much of a centre piece to effect the film negatively the film really does bring feelings of the matrix and other great sci fi films it is up there with them the plot nearly becomes too convoluted at times but in truth that helps in a film like this that is where the cronenberg and lynch influence is evident the film has you constantly working out what is going on and genuinely surprises as it goes along this is overall an obvious cult classic and i can see this being incredibly popular when it is released in the states 1 2 br br
i missed this movie in the cinema but had some idea in the back of my head that it was worth a look so when i saw it on the shelves in dvd i thought time to watch it big mistake br br a long list of stars cannot save this turkey surely one of the worst movies ever an incomprehensible plot is poorly delivered and poorly presented perhaps it would have made more sense if i'd read robbins' novel but unless the film is completely different to the novel and with robbins assisting in the screenplay i doubt it the novel would have to be an excruciating read as well br br i hope the actors were well paid as they looked embarrassed to be in this waste of celluloid and more lately dvd blanks take for example pat morita even thurman has the grace to look uncomfortable at times br br save yourself around 98 minutes of your life for something more worthwhile like trimming your toenails or sorting out your sock drawer even when you see it in the under 5 throw away bin at your local store resist the urge
fassbinder's most lavish production sacrifices little of his talent for identifying and deconstructing a locus of suffering in long mobile takes that somehow also act as social encapsulations here it's much more overt since the story takes place in war torn germany at the end of wwii and the central character is a woman hanna schygulla as maria who capitalizes on vulnerabilities both economic and gender related to catapult herself up the ladder of a prominent textile corp that makes coveted goods like lederhosen available to indigent workers as she once was married amidst allied air raids maria and her new husband herrmann are allowed a brief honeymoon before he's shipped out to the russian front in his absence her despair is great she spends most days at the train station waiting for him to return when he is reported dead she abruptly stops grieving and takes a job as a barmaid prostitute at a brothel catering to american gi's br br when he returns things get plenty messy as circumstances and his sense of noble self sacrifice conspire to keep them apart the message is fassbinder's m o writ large 'love is colder than death ' but not only is maria contending with her own sanity and a husband largely incapable of loving her but a country in deep flux with no discernible light at the end of the tunnel fassbinder is making some kind of statement on post war germany selling out to the highest bidder but as with all his films i tend to block those elements out and focus on the unbearable passions on display fassbinder's as evoked through his characters his actors' as filtered through their real life connections with fassbinder taken together his films can be either unbearable or indescribably mesmeric often at once this falls somewhere in between although definitely closer to the latter while i didn't like it quite as much as the bitter tears of petra von kant or katzelmacher maria braun certainly has a greater scope and what's more i could feel its passion and authentic detail to human emotions
this movie is trash poor it has horrible taste and is pedestrian and unconvincing in script although supposedly based on real events which doesn't add much of anything but make it more of a disappointment direction is not well done at as scenes and dialogue are out of place not sure what robin williams saw in this character or story to start williams is not convincing as a gay in a relationship breakup nor is the relationship itself interesting what's worse his character is compelled by an ugly pedophile story that is base and has no place as a plot device you have an older rory culkin tastelessly spouting d ck smker in good fun which is annoying enough and then laughed up by the williams character finally you have sandra oh as a guardian angel adviser to williams and a thrown in explanation of the whole fiasco towards the end toni collete's character is just plain annoying and a re hash of her 6th sense performance with poorer direction very miss able
this is not a love song br br my one word summary of this film would be excellent' br br it probably won't appeal to the mass movie watching public  it's a br br film that forces you to participate you observe think and question br br comparisons could be made with deliverance topic theme and br br perhaps with the blair witch project for overall filming style br br however this film stands unique against both br br the cinematography effects solarisation freeze frame blur etc br br have been seen before but they are used most effectively in this br br film to underpin the natural tension of the story br br acting is raw menacing and utterly believable br br the real theme of the film is about friendship the title really gives br br the game away it's probably not the kind of friendship that most of br br us have experienced or indeed would want to br br it is a love song
this is the best film version of dicken's classic tale i've seen it over and over on vhs and recently acquired the dvd version which is formatted for tv not wide screen what i find interesting about this teleplay is the cast of english actors who are now recognizable since many have appeared in other films shows in north america since 1984 my biggest surprise is edward woodward the equalizer as the ghost of christmas present
i originally saw this very dark comedy around 2000 or so on cable tv what a surprise and delight everyone is covertly armed in this movie dreyfuss plays the mental don remember the new york don who was supposed to be schizophrenic art imitates life or vice versa diane lane and ellen barkin are at their most beautiful and not to be toyed with thus proving that beauty and toughness do go together then there is the great bullshit scene between barkin and jeff goldblum rita and mickey where they verbally play off the world bullshit this film is both subtle and bald for all the shooting it can be a very quiet film and you have the opportunity to see several actors in their final or near final roles joey bishop richard pryor henry silva it is not a film for everyone but if you like a film that has a lot of word play and keeps moving without blowing up everything in sight this is the film for you roger ebert dumps on this film he's flat wrong this is a fine fine film maybe just not one for ebert i consider it as a 10 because of how well it is done and how funny the script can be while not really being a straight comedy kind of film i like it so well that i bought it on dvd because it just doesn't get shown very much on cable tv now it's all mine
michelle rodrigez was made for this movie when i first saw her in fast and the furious you could tell that she was a tough woman with this movie she has not only proven her acting but shows no fear and is tough like she should be in this movie she is more a bad girl and that's what i like about her this movie is about a troubled girl living the life as a tom boy and getting in constant trouble with school and family as she gets interested in her brothers training to be a boxer she decides to go after her love to fight and asks her brothers trainer to train her even though they don't think she has the potential they get to be shown proven wrong br br i think this movie was a little slow at the ending but was well done it shows that people can do anything even if they don't think you have the potential i recommend it to be seen
i am oh soooo glad i have not spent money to go to the cinema on it it is nothing more than compilation of elements of few other classic titles like the thing final fantasy the abyss etc framed in rather dull and meaningless scenario i really can not figure out what was the purpose of creating this movie it has absolutely nothing new to offer in its storyline which additionally is also senseless moreover there is nothing to watch the fx'es look like there were taken from a second hand store you generally saw all of them in other movies but it is definitely a good lullaby
this movie was a long build up with no climax people whom refer to the swordfight in the end as great must either be out of their minds or have none way too often this movie got soft i am not saying that soft movies are bad but no matter how fond you are of sugar it should have no space on a t bone steak this movie was supposed to be about vengeance for crimes committed against a culture but it ended up being a petty bar brawl and there was only one of them who actually knew what a sword was tim roth's character and yes he plays him well rob roy was a weak hero with no knowledge of how to use a sword and the way he won was a disgrace as a drama this movie had it's periods but the best performance in it has to go the nature of scotland this is one tad breath short of being termed as soap in my book
an excellent movie about two cops loving the same woman one of the cop périer killed her but all the evidences seems to incriminate the other montand the unlucky montand doesnt know who is the other lover that could have killed her and périer doesnt know either that montand had an affair with the girl montand must absolutely find the killer and what a great ending highly recommended
if you want to make a movie like this have the threat be real don't surround your patsy with a bunch of bonzos there is no credibility here the plot is dull and unbelievable the acting is even worse i thought that i was watching arthur lake dagwood who is one of the worst actors in history when i saw the main character oh well at some point he has to face the music and get fighting mad i don't care do you there are all these long scenes set in this austere office the furniture made out of cardboard or masonite people talk and smoke and don't do anything most of the action happens in a five minute sequence after that it's over don't bother
in my honest opinion everyone should see this movie at least once it really put things in perspective as i watched it though it was fictional this movie is about something that could happen to your children br br it shows how easily two kids can hide both their hatred for their school and their plans to murder innocent students this film would not have worked in any other format they pulled off the hand held camera perfectly br br it reminds us of april 20th 1999 when eric harris and dylan klebold murdered 12 students and then themselves it also reminds us of the media storm that followed after everyone wanted to see the rampart video and everyone wanted to see the basement tapes br br this movie is a fictional version of our dreams coming true we get to see the kid behind the monster br br the only bad thing about this movie is that it did not do well on the market and few people even know it existed if it would have had a single preview on a single blockbuster movie everyone would have gone to see what the big deal was about zero day br br i believe this is the best film adaptation of a school shooting of the few that have truly attempted it the shooting itself only takes up about ten minutes of the hour and a half long film because it mostly focuses on cal and andre and what they did up to that point br br if you have not yet seen this movie go rent it and watch it i guarantee that when it is finished you will be speechless
ok me and a friend rented this a few days ago because we like to keep track of b movies since we do them ourselves anyway the cover contained blood and weird looking naked girls with fangs and stuff and tom savini there is just no way this movie can fail right wrong it just seems like such a waste there was really no story the dialog was terrible is anyone there x 1000 the characters were well they really lacked any kind of personality the effects were terrible and whats up with these long artsy shots of scared people running around doing nothing with extreme closeups of eyes and stuff we were sitting the whole movie waiting for something anything to happen but no oh here comes the nymphs great oh they're kissing again and now for the violence ok nothing really happens again oh now they run around and the closeups of eyes again oh heres tom savini oh he died right ok maybe now something cool or even interesting will happen no oh cool a severed head the end oh crap and finally since i'm so full of myself i'll tell you this give me a van six actors a weird looking house tom savini a couple of naked girls with fangs and buckets of blood and i could make the coolest movie you've ever seen i've made movies with zero budget in two days that has better effects better acting and a better script than this what is this johannes guy doing making cool movies is easy it could have been so great i'm really upset
vince lombardi high school has a new principal the evil ms togar mary woronov she intends to ban rock and roll music all together she butts head with riff randall p j soles who loves the ramones also the head of the school football team vincent van patten can't seem to connect with any girl not realizing cute kate rambeau dey young is in love with him br br an instant midnight movie this was put in general release and almost immediately bombed but as a midnight movie it was a huge hit and kept playing all through the 1980s i remember attending more than a few of those when i was in college it was like a party people were singing along with the songs laughing uproariously at every joke and generally just having fun br br seeing it now as an adult i can't imagine why i loved this so much the script is juvenile and full of groaners that i couldn't believe i was hearing characters change at random and the movie goes jumping all over the place what saves this are some truly funny lines and wonderful performances by soles and woronov who is really enjoying herself also everyone is full of energy and playing their roles way over the top as they should as for the ramones i was never a fan i do like the title tune but the rest of the songs never really caught me if you're a ramones fan you might give this a higher rating br br spoiler warning this is mostly for kids it has a pg rating who will probably find it silly but fun i especially think they'll like the end when the high school is blown up spoiler end br br so if you're in the mood for a silly midnight movie from the 1980s you might like this otherwise stay away i give it a 7
i watched this movie 11 years ago in company with my best female friend i got my judgment teeth pulled out so i didn't feel very good br br i ended up liking it big time it's a hard watch if you take in account that it deals with friendship unwanted betrayal power money drug traffic and the extreme hard situation that deals with living in a foreign jail br br the acting is on it's prime level two of the women that i lust the most star and that's a good thing claire danes is as cute and charming as always while kate beckinsale is extremely hot and delivers a fine performance bill pullman is also great and demonstrates his histrionic qualities br br there are many plot twists to dig from and make it an interesting visual experience plus it shows the difficult times at thailand br br this is an underrated movie not many films like this one have come up in recent history it should make you reflex about many things
i rated this a 3 the dubbing was as bad as i have seen the plot yuck i'm not sure which ruined the movie more jet li is definitely a great martial artist but i'll stick to jackie chan movies until somebody tells me jet's english is up to par
this is definitely one of the best movies i've ever seen it has everything a genuinely touching screenplay fine actors that make subtlety a beautiful art to watch an actually elegant romance it's a shame that that kind of romance just doesn't seem to exist anymore lovely songs and lyrics especially the final song an artistic score and costumes and sets that make you want to live in them the ending was only a disappointment in that i was expecting a spectacular film to have a brilliant end but it was still more wonderful then the vast majority of movies out there definitely check this movie out over and over again there are many details you miss the first time that deserve a second look
did i step in something or is that bad smell coming from daybreak 1 2 god was behind everything what has god got to do with sci fi god is only the answer when you can't think up a sensible explanation for something in fact this is exactly the problem with the series finale they obviously couldn't think up sensible explanations for the multitude of big questions that were raised throughout the series such as how kara thrace come back from the dead in a brand new viper how her old viper and charred body ended up on earth 2 why baltar has an imaginary 6 in his head why 6 has an imaginary baltar in her head etc so they explain it with angels or just don't explain it at all br br the plot of the last 2 episodes had holes big enough to fly a basestar through for example why does galactica and its crew go on a suicide mission to rescue one girl hera particularly after adama said there was no way he'd attempt a rescue because they found out the location of the cylon base that's not a good reason to sacrifice the crew's lives and how did anders know the location and what was the point of the flashbacks to the major characters' lives before the war it's like they forgot to do it earlier so they threw something in at the last moment br br the people who wrote the last two episodes could not have been the same writers who created what has been so far a sensational series feels like the script writing was take over by evangelical christians on a mission to spread 'the word' forget trying to tie up the loose ends in the plot the important message the writers wanted to get across is don't put your faith in technology as it will lead to your destruction god is your ultimate salvation tough luck if you have an illness that needs medical treatment br br imagine in the final movie of the star wars series they tell you there is no force instead a jedi actually gets his power from jesus then they fly their spaceships into the nearest star and go live in the forest with the ewoks would this be a good ending no it frakken' wouldn't
i am a big fan a faerie tale theatre and i've seen them all and this is one of the best it's funny romantic and a classic i recommend this for all ages it's great for little kids because it's well cinderella and great for adults and teen because it's funny and not over the top i watched it when i was little and i still watch it now it has great lines that my family and i quote all the time the acting is great and it never gets old if you like fairy tales and romances you will love this i've watched many a cinderella movie in my time and this is the best of them all sorry disney i highly recommend this movie and all the faerie tale theatre shows they all appeal to all ages and are all unique and very entertaining
let me first state that while i have viewed every episode of startrek at least twice i do not consider myself a trekker or trekkie those are people who live in their parents basement and attend conventions wearing costumes with pointed rubber ears i gave this movie a seven casting aside the fiction historical errors the acting was better than average but the plot held no surprises they tried very hard to reverse engineer the technology but still the special effects were just to great a temptation now as to the historical errors if you call them that the first capitan to pilot the enterprise was commander april then capt pike jim kirk etc according to a statement made by both riker and kirk we dicovered the klingons and educated them and gave them the technology that's the reason a prime directive was created but like i said these are no reason to discredit this fine series i hope the plots will get deeper and then special effects can take a backseat
despite of the success in comedy or drama the turkish directors are failure in horror thriller okul d bbe are good examples for the awful horror turkish films br br but if you watch gen you will understand that it is a strike the atmosphere of the movie is impressive and dark also the special features are colorful and not cheap the soundtracks fit the movie but the script is not totally perfect and the theme of the movie is ordinary br br as a result gen does not add any difference to horror movies but it does not disappoint thriller fans in this respect it is a success for yesilcam and turkey 7 10
this movie really deserves the mst3k treatment a pseudo ancient fantasy hack n slash tale featuring twin barbarian brothers with a collective iq of hot water character names that seem to have been derived from a mad libs book and such classic lines as hold her down and uncover her belly the barbarians crosses over into the so bad it's good territory

the only other film besides soylent green that has such an air of hopelessness is on the beach both films deal with the consequences for the species and the planet from man made cataclysms on the beach with nuclear war and soylent green with the environmental poisoning of the planet br br maybe there's cause for some optimism because as of 2007 we haven't reached either of the worlds described in those films and we were supposed to by now new york city still has about 8 million people not the 22 million by the turn of the millenia as described in soylent green environmentalists always hail this film as showing the consequence of global warming for myself it also shows the right to life ethic run amuck obviously there's no family planning in this world either br br charlton heston is an nypd detective who lives with room mate edward g robinson who's old enough to remember the earth before catastrophe struck there's been a murder committed joseph cotten an executive with the soylent corporation a multi national concern that has come up with a food product some kind of wafer in many colors to feed the world's population it's latest product is soylent green br br the investigation finds charlton heston getting his man but also it leads to some horrifying truths about the soylent corporation and the future of mankind as heston shouts in the end that soylent green is made of people that we've become a race of cannibals the horrifying thing is that there is no alternative we've exhausted the planet and we have to eat our dead to survive br br this was the farewell performance of edward g robinson and in his memoirs heston spoke movingly of robinson even though they had differing political views a few weeks after robinson wrapped that final scene of his screen demise by consented euthanasia he passed away in real life not many did but heston knew that robinson was terminally and there was no acting involved in that final death scene between the two of them br br though the timetable was off it doesn't mean that the world envisioned by soylent green may not come to pass hopefully we'll have not just the intelligence but the sense of shared responsibility to keep that from happening
wow i went to the video store tonight because i was in the mood for a bad b horror movie and i found this gem i looked at the cover and i thought it looked like just the movie for my mood i brought it home and put it on br br this movie was not the b horror movie that i had in mind this was much worse i wanted a bad movie but what i got i didn't know that crap like this existed amongst man this movie seemed like a 5 year old wrote and directed it and that is being nice about it br br i am an aspiring director and this movie made me so mad that someone out there is actually paying this guy to direct movies he needs to work at a garbage dump shoveling crap where he belongs br br if you are thinking about renting this or buying it i will tell you the same thing that i would tell someone getting ready to commit suicide don't do it it's not worth it i really have nothing nice to say about this movie don't do it
imagine being so hampered by a bureaucracy that a one man spends 8 year's of his life and has a mental breakdown trying to solve a mass murder case virtually by himself the murder technique is clear but a government unwilling to admit the truth let's a monster destroy dozens of lives when i think my job is stressful i merely remember the true story behind this wonder flick the devotion to duty of the main character was masterfully portrayed by rea the comic and almost tragic at times relationship between rea and the sutherland character made this one of my favorite movies of the last 5 years the catching of one of the worst mass murderers in history had me on the edge of my seat while not nearly as well advertised and talked about as silence of the lamb's the plot was just as suspenseful rent or buy this movie today
this movie sucked plain and simple okay so it's basically about a girl that gets raped and to get revenge she gets another guy to rape the rapist the rapist is a douche but the girl victim is partly to blame i mean they both get in the mood and start kissing and stuff but when the rapist tries to have sex with her she doesn't allow it so the rapist rapes her and the thing is the rape scene for the girl is very short and it doesn't really expose or show anything but when it comes to the rapist getting raped it's a pretty long rape scene there is basically nothing in the story that is worth watching br br 3 2 10
am not familiar with the trilogy but came upon this film last night on showtime the film looked very well done with the set design and the cinematography but the screenplay was stilted and wooden the acting was fairly bad thought the two female leads were serviceable you never really believed anything the supporting actors said though there were the stereotypes bible thumping reverend without a hint of nuance authoritative captain hot headed soldier etc i am sorry to say that based on these deficiencies i clocked it straight away as canadian without knowing it to be such the telefilm canada end credits gave it away i know i'm a horrible person br br maybe i missed something in the beginning but the hostility towards the girls is never explained here they are besieged in a fort by werewolves and the men are wasting time and energy brutalizing two young women for no reason focus people there's a bit more of a pressing situation beyond your walls than whether or not these girls are lesbians that's just my inference for the hostility directed towards them if they can aim and fire a gun you might as well make nice with them the question of their immortal soul can be resolved later br br also i guess this relates to the rest of the trilogy these girls are supposed to be the protagonists one of them murdered the indian guy at the end that saved one of their lives i guess one is just a victim of her condition who can't be necessarily blamed for her actions but the other is just a murderer who doesn't deserve her happy ending
hey everyone br br there really isn't much to say for this movie at all the basic plot is that a guy brandon takes a few friends on a trip to his cabin in the woods for a weekend holiday away from work after picking up a girl on the way there things start going badly wrong for all of them br br the storyline alone written by the actor playing brandon i believe although i could be wrong here is unlikely and unconvincing and is acted out accordingly the clown killer himself is a rather a sad excuse for a psychotic killer far from being a dark mysterious but most of all intelligent predator we are instead offered a rather clumsy nursery rhyme singing buffoon who appears to be going through a minor mid life crisis the only thing that warranted the writing of this comment were the sex scenes and whatever gore there was in the film the quality of the film led me to derive some enjoyment out of such things br br in short this film falls below every possible set standard admittedly i was sharing a few beers with a close friend as i watched this so we managed to scrape together some relative entertainment value out of this film and it is therefore only fair to mention that s i c k did fall just shy of a two rating however in reality and with the benefit of hindsight the one star rating is a more than legitimate score for this film br br 1 star out of ten
hammerhead is a combination between the mad scientist and killer shark movie genres in a bit of type casting jeffrey combs plays the aforementioned mad scientist who develops a human hammerhead shark creature bizarrely this being is in fact his son who he has turned into this monster to prevent him dying from cancer or something br br a group of associates are invited to the scientist's private island they end up being used as shark bait or shark mate for some unknown reason the head of it has been brought along as part of this team who knows why luckily he turns out to be a resourceful if somewhat overweight ramboesque hero i'm working on the assumption that he learnt how to handle an assault rifle as part of his day job working in 1st line support a normal day for this it man presumably involves fixing someone's network connection followed by a call to gun down gun toting evil doers or perhaps a call to fix someone's pc has to be scheduled between physical confrontations with land based human shark hybrids anyway he's amazing and saves the day he even get's the girl br br the shark man is a slightly lame creation but ok i guess judging by the effects in general in this film and the movie moves on at a decent pace it's complete hokum of course but if you buy a movie called hammerhead and expect it to be a complex drama about the emotional conflicts experienced by a man turned into a land based killer fish then really you have no one to blame but yourself as it is there are guns gore girls and possibly even an exploding helicopter it's rubbish but not as bad as some might say
kurt russell's chameleon like performance coupled with john carpenter's flawless filmmaking makes this one without a doubt one of the finest boob tube bios ever aired it holds up too the emotional foundation is strong enough that it'll never age carpenter has preserved for posterity the power and ultimate poignancy of the life of the one and only king of rock and roll i'd been a borderline elvis fan most of my life but it wasn't until i saw this mind blowingly moving movie that i looked beyond the image at the man himself it was quite a revelation elvis remains one of the top ten made for tv movies of all time
i think that this movie was reasonbaly good it's kinda weird that now the olsen twins are 13 and have boyfriends and all i enjoyed them alot when they were little kids on full house anyway the casting was good and the movie was somewhat funny i kind of got mixed up between all the switching places and their names it's just kind of an older version of it takes two
since its release in 1983 a christmas story the jean shepherd narrated story of his alter ego ralphie has become a true classic my summer story however still has shepherd as the narrator but it has absolutely none of the charm and the characters are nowhere near the caliber of the original film br br my summer story is basically a mishmash of mediocre and just plain not very interesting stories which include hillbilly neighbors and battling tops charles grodin who i normally like is extremely unlikeable in the role of the father more aptly handled by darren mcgavin in the original and his character never seems anything but forced kiernan culkin is a poor substitute for ralphie and the little brother is all but forgotten here only mom seems to have any worth here and perhaps that's because she beans a cinema manager with a gravy boat when he pushes his luck too far with irate housewives on free dish night br br the stories in this are mostly inconsequential and stretched paper thin may appeal to the extremely undemanding but as a sequel to a christmas story it's a very poor one and not worth most people's time 2 out of 10
holes 2003 dir andrew davis br br when stanley yelnats iv is wrongfully convicted of stealing he is sent to 'camp green lake' at this camp the warden and her two henchman mr sir and dr pendanski command the campmates to dig holes after hole after hole but for what reason stanley plans to find out br br i never really had any intention in watching 'holes' and i must admit i only really watched the film because i'm such a fan of shia labeouf but even if you are not a fan of him then it doesn't matter 'holes' is one of those disney film that the whole family can enjoy the story is lovely written and incorporates a wonderful idea of including flashbacks to the past these are not distracting and really gives a great back story all the cast are great the young stars act well and the addition of jon voight and sigourney weaver are a joy shia labeouf shows that even at 17 he can act without any flaws this is one disney film you definitely would enjoy as a family br br i learn from failure stanley yelnats iii henry winkler
ok but does that make this a good movie well not really in my opinion there isn't a whole lot to recommend it i found it very slow tediously in fact it's also predictable pretty much through and through number one and two were somewhat predictable but not as much i also felt this movie was quite campy at times which i didn't really think fits this series and the character jeff fahey plays the main bad guy in this installment he's a decent enough actor but i felt he played his character too over the top i guess that fit with the tone of the movie which would have been great if i had liked the movie plus there were some pretty bad one liners arnold vosloo returns in the title role but is given little to work with in this movie the character has not really evolved as i had hoped oh well this is just my opinion anyway for me while this movie is not abysmal it is pretty bad my vote for darkman iii 3 5 5
i was really excited about seeing this film i thought finally australia had made a good film but i was wrong br br this was the most pathetic attempt at a slasher film ever i feel sorry for molly ringwald having to come all the way to australia to make an awful movie br br the acting was terrible especially that australian guy who was trying to speak in an american accent and the plot was also pretty bad br br when i first heard about this film coming out i thought that the title was pathetic because it sounds like the cheesy film stab in scream 2 but i was willing to let it slide if it was a good movie br br warning major spoilers br br probably the worst thing about the film was the ending i was expecting a big surprise about who the killer was but the killer wasn't even human which turned this realistic slasher film into an awful horror movie br br don't see this film you'll probably be disappointed
people expect no less than brilliant when steven spielberg directs a movie and this movie is no exception some movies i love did poorly at the box office but i'm glad to say this movie isn't one of them over nine million dollars which i don't think was bad for back then the characters were fun the animation was clear and not fuzzy and the music was modern too which is unusual for an animated movie i didn't think professor screw eyes or his scary cirus was too scary for little kids the targeted audience for this movie but i thought what happened to the creepy professor at the end was a little too dark for a kids' movie overall this movie is a fun and enchanting classic that i have loved dearly for years
dude really where have you guys been the past 20 years this is shocking in all kind of ways horror this is a joke there is nothing wrong with being low budget but this is a laugh if you want to look at the classics freaks of tod browning the victims of dracula and frankenstein the undying monster ernest thesiger paul wegener's the golem and the passengers of the ghost train you can't compare it it gives it a bad name bad acting bad screenplay etc total waist of money and free time have watched a lot of movies were as horror is my all time favorite i really am speechless have nothing more to say that please don't do the effort to watch something so daft please understand
this is a typical perfect crime thriller a perfect crime is executed and the investigating police officer ignoring all the clues immediately knows who guilty is the audience has to wait around the whole movie for the guilty to be caught the result is like every single episode of columbo or murder she wrote the director himself refers to the hackney story by showing the police officer watching an episode of matlock this story barely fills up 90 minutes but the director insists on using all 120 minutes filling with every cliche in the book skip this one you are not missing anything
saw this in the theater in '86 and fell out of my chair laughing more than once beirut what do you know about beirut beirut he's the best damn baseball that ever lived br br you know how it's going to end but it has a great time getting there the training scenes are very funny but the best scene may be the one when jack and reno are attempting to watch the falcons v vikings monday night football game while attempting a make up dinner with their wives br br williams and russell seem to have a lot of fun with this one and it's too bad that it's overlooked as a top notch comedy
i watched this movie to the end and that was really not easy it is so boring bad played and in nearly every detail stolen from blair witch project that you can't believe the makers take this serious even harder to believe is how this product made it onto vhs and dvd br br so if want to see a horror movie just watch scream but if you want to laugh out loud and have a good time watching some kids running through the woods screaming at each other and showing of their inability watch dark area
a horribly pointless and worse boring film stranger than fiction has nothing new to say about anything no characters beyond the most unimaginative stereotypes and relies on a clunky central concept that is neither particularly original nor dealt with in a vaguely innovative way br br will ferrell is totally wasted in what he presumably hoped to be his answer to jim carey's truman show and substitutes his usual shouting routine admittedly very funny if you discount talledega nights for well pretty much nothing br br emma thompson is no more than mildly irritating that some reviews i've read here are talking her up for an oscar nomination is laughable whilst maggie gyllenhaal does a passable job with a very weak script that allows nothing beyond establishing her character as a former law student who dropped out of harvard to become a baker because she liked making people happy please that she ended up falling for ferrell's 'character' is utterly ludicrous br br marc forster's attempts to jazz up the film using computer graphics only serve to highlight the uninspired the material he has to work with br br i had the choice of either going to watch the prestige for the third time or seeing this i wish i'd opted for the prestige
eva hedy lamarr has just got married with an older man and in the honeymoon she realizes that her husband does not desire her her disappointment with the marriage and the privation of love makes eva returning to her father's home in a farm leaving her husband one afternoon while bathing in a lake her horse escapes with her clothes and an young worker retrieves and gives them back to eva they fall in love for each other and become lovers later her husband misses her and tries to have eva back home eva refuses and fortune leads the trio to the same place ending the affair in a tragic way i have just watched extase for the first time and the first remark i have is relative to the horrible quality of the vhs released in brazil by the brazilian distributor video network the movie has only 75 minutes running time and it seems that it was used different reels of film there are some parts totally damaged and other parts very damaged therefore the beauty of the images in not achieved by the brazilian viewer if he has a chance to find this rare vhs in a rental or for sale the film is practically a silent movie the story is very dated and has only a few lines consequently the characters are badly developed however this movie is also very daring with the exposure of hedy lamarr beautiful breasts and naked fat body for the present standards of beauty another fantastic point is the poetic and metaphoric used of flowers symbolizing the intercourse between eva and her lover the way the director conducts the scenes to show the needs and privation of eva is very clear the non conclusive end is also very unusual for a 1933 movie i liked this movie but i hope one day have a chance to see a 87 minutes restored version my vote is eight br br title brazil Êxtase ecstasy
i made a special effort to see this movie and was totally disappointed with the outcome on paper the script seems hopeful and the choice of actors leaves one with hopes i liked pacino in scent of a woman and have seen anny duperrey and marthe keller in several french and other films of the 70s 80s but i had forgotten how important a part dialogues can play in a film and in this film they are absolute trash the filming locations were also attractive but the hopeless pretentious and forced dialogues pulled the whole thing down to sub zero level in addition to that i am pretty allergic to the world of motor racing and find no interest in this sport even the inelegant dialogues in love story were better than the ones in this film and that's saying something i was really expecting better from this film and was very disappointed to have been let down so much
a bunch of women who can't act sit around talk smoke pot they have another woman in a wheelchair they hide because she is deformed and occasionally they kill some one to feed this person human flesh that really looks like some store bought ham which they dressed up by sticking on a few plastic fingers we don't see them killing anyone suddenly there is a body on the floor covered by a bloodied sheet i can't eat spam cover by a sheet anymore because of this just the thought of spam cover by a sheet is enough to induce the same narcoleptic fit brought on by trying to get through all of this movie occasionally there are randomly inserted scenes of a guy who is hunting them by way of torturing some guy he strapped to a chair is his basement why he caught this guy and how he is connected to the sit on the couch sisters is never explained there are also scenes of some superhuman guy freaking out he p es blood and punches through a wall but who he is or what is wrong with him is neither explained nor even tied in to the story br br there is no action no special effects no story if you want to watch some boring people talk in a profound way about nothing while sitting around and eating ham and smoking then here's 90 minutes of that because except for a scene where one chick does some hooking on a street corner and the aformentioned random scenes absolutely nothing happens yawn oh i almost forgot you get to see them move some stuff including the deformed sister when they move to their new apartment its one of the few times they're not sitting on a couch or lying in bed
ok where do i begin this movie changed my life the plot was seamless james cahill has out done himself initially after a first viewing i was disappointed that i hadn't seen it on the silver screen however this was before exploring the dvd's many features oh my god jakes cahill's commentary of the film was almost as flawless as his acting he told of industry secrets used in the film that you only get with experience br br i was so impressed by the other actors the scene where the security guard is talking to the girl in the hallway reminded me of some of my favorite blue pornographic movies i am certainly with gangsta when he expresses his disappointment with no sequel br br i am still blown away with each viewing of the martial arts skills involved matched only by the sign indicating the location of the library at the school and possibly the guy playing a retard all in all a timeless classic and the best film to come out of europe in years where my oscars at dawn
i loved this mini series tara fitzgerald did an incredible job portraying helen graham a beautiful young woman hiding along with her young son from a mysterious past as an anglophile who loves romances this movie was just my cup of tea and i would recommend it to anyone looking to escape for a few hours into the england of the 1800's i also must mention that toby stephens who portrays the very magnetic gilbert markham is reason enough to watch this wonderful production
three teenage girls in an incomplete triangular relation the base of the triangle is barely there at the apex is marie a serious short and lean tomboy with a belmondo like facial structure her best friend is the physical and psychological opposite coquette chubby i dare say fat and desirous for her first kiss with a boy but not quite ready for her first sexual encounter because of her chubbiness boys don't seem interested and it pains her br br the other leg of the apex is a beautiful fille fatale blonde vamp she is deeply involved in the sport of synchronized swimming performing at competitive level marie sees her during a competition at the local public swimming pool marie insinuates herself into the life of the vamp using the desire to become a synchronized swimmer as an argument the vamp has a reputation of being a whore making out with any young male that orbits around her marie is not phased out by that reputation put a stress on reputation br br the first half is set up we get to see a lot of synchronized swimming as we become familiar with the three girls eventually the narrative leaves synchronized swimming behind and concentrates on the topsy turvy relations among the three that's when unexpected things start to happen br br it is a trademark of french films to drop nuggets of wisdom on the viewer this one is no exception here it is about ceilings and the dying see the film to learn more br br the director says that the use of synchronized swimming is purposeful that women only sport is a metaphor for a girl's life pretty and feminine on the surface while hard working and competitive underneath a number of scenes drive this point elegant moves and smiles for the public legs kicking ungainly underwater the title in french is also suggestive prieuve or octopus suggest an individual having to juggle many pressures simultaneously
with all the excessive violence in this film it could've been nc 17 but the gore could've been pg 13 and there were quite a lot of swears when the mum had the original jackass bad hairdewed boy friend there was a lot of character development which made the film better to watch then after the kid came back to life as the scarecrow there was a mindless hour and ten minutes of him killing people the violence was overly excessive and i think the bodycount was higher than twelve which is a large number for movies like this almost every character in the film is stabbed or gets their head chopped off but the teacher who called him white trash and hoodlum though the character lester is anything but a hoodlum not even close i know hoods and am part hood they don't draw in class they sit there and throw stuff at the teacher the teacher deserved a more gruesome death than anyone of the characters but was just stabbed in the back there were two suspenseful scenes in the film but didn't last long enough to be scary at all as i said the killings were excessive and sometimes people who have nothing to do with the story line get their heads chopped off if the gore was actually fun to see then it would've been nc 17 two kids describe a body they find in the cornfields they describe it as a lot gorier than it actually was they explained to the cop that there were maggots crawling around in the guys intestines his stomach had not even been cut open so there was no way maggots were in his stomach though i would've liked to see that the acting was pathetic characters were losers and the scarecrow could do a lot of gymnastix stunts i suggest renting this movie for the death scenes i wont see it again anytime soon but i enjoyed the excessive violence also don't bother with the sequel i watched five minutes of it and was bored to death it sounds good but isn't the original scarecrow actually kept me interested
to anyone who hasn't seen this film yet i have a friendly warning don't watch la casa dell'orco expecting any demons at all because you won't find them here this film is not a third installment to the demons series and it has nothing to do with it whatsoever except the fact that lamberto bava directed them as a matter of fact michele soavi's the church is also known an unofficial demons 3 and it's a deceptive title in that case as well so go figure it is obvious that due to the demons films success they tried to deceive the audience with misleading titles even though it is obvious that this is a disconnected story having said that i think it's unfair on the other hand to say that la casa dell'orco is not worth the look honestly the movie is quite atmospheric and even though there are a few unintentionally hilarious situations i thought it was genuinely creepy on the whole nevertheless i think it's fair to say that the story somehow tries to emulate lucio fulci's the house by the cemetery of course that's just a speculation i have but i think i have my valid evidences for instance in both films paolo marco is the man of the family in both films there's an irritating little son named bobby in both films the woman of the house is a beautiful thirty something who seems to be the only one to see that there's something really wrong in the new house and in both films there's something really really wrong going on in the basement i'm sorry but i can relate both films very easily and i'm not saying that as an accusation for the contrary my point is that those who enjoyed the house by the cemetery are probably going to enjoy this movie as well keeping in mind of course that la casa dell'orco is far less pretentious less scary not nearly as atmospheric but the formula is still there br br in la casa dell'orco charel her husband tom and their little son bobby go on a vacation trip to an old deserted castle situated in the heart of an italian villa called trifiri leaving aside the beauty of the place shortly after their arrival charel starts to have the feeling that she has been there before which is impossible considering that she had never been to trifiri before sadly charel can't get over her déjà vu and the worst part is that her visions come along with the image of a horrendous creature going after her tom who is not a very patient guy to begin with advices her to leave the nonsensical hallucinations aside and enjoy the vacation however the woman's visions become more and more real and the peace and quiet that they were supposed to enjoy suddenly turn into a living nightmare the old nightmare from charel's childhood becomes real and this time she won't be able to escape without confronting that menacing ogre first br br as it is expected the plot somehow turns out to be a little bit simplistic and as a consequence it is hard to fill an hour and a half this means that la casa dell'orco offers more than a couple of sequences with nothing but total silence and the image of the main character walking around the castle for several minutes reviving the images of her childhood and nothing else it gets rather tedious from time to time but overall it's nothing serious like many italian horror films that came out throughout the late eighties this movie is pretty stylish and effective but it also offers a nice variety of unintentionally funny moments that make the movie unforgettable in a way for instance the part in which charel is brutally slapped by her husband and instead of going to her bedroom crying like i would have expected she strikes back against him by punching him on the face really hard and running away to the woods like a maniac the funniest thing however is the fact that two minutes later they're a happy couple again as if punching each other like that was the most natural thing in the world i know it's silly but i myself found it absolutely hilarious the ogre which is obviously the villain of the story looks creepy and funny at the same time too and let's face it a villain who can freak us out and make us laugh a little bit it's twice as welcomed it reminded me of michael jackson in thriller but much more natural and human of course but if focusing on the genuinely good aspects that i mentioned before the music composed by simon boswell is one of the high points and even if it pretty much always the same it fits perfectly and it helps to create a rather dark atmosphere during the moments of tension so if i have to give my final statement regarding this movie i'm going to have to say that i can't help loving it including the small flaws and most people who enjoy these typical italian horror movies from the late eighties won't be disappointed by this one it has all the typical and always well received clichés like the crazy old man who actually speaks the truth the foxy local woman who is said to be a witch a creepy castle a huge dark basement with a terrible secret and the local folks who try to prevent the tourist with their hostility to stay away from the infamous lands i would say that la casa dell'orco deserves two thumbs up and a punch at your spouse's face as a way to pay tribute to the heroine of the story take this movie for what it is and enjoy it
this film for an after school special isn't that bad and that's the problem nothing happens you feel as if you're still in class a guy teaches a bunch of young underdogs how to be good paint ball players we never get to see these underdogs doing badly as the good player is training them they all of the sudden turn into good players by meditating also there are too many characters and no character development too much time is spend on the main character and his sexy sister and not enough on some of the other kids this could have had a 'bad news bears' feel the original since there was a girl on an all boys team but there wasn't any feel to this movie at all it has no feeling and leaves a dull pain in your bones after watching it is not fun to bag on not fun to watch and is just kind of there plain boring something you'd watch after school before your pre evening nap as dull as the day is long and it's been a long long day watching this movie
greta garbo's american film debut is an analogy of how our lives can be swept off course by fate and our actions as in a torrent causing us to lose a part of ourselves along the way br br greta plays leonora a poor peasant girl in love with ricardo cortez's character don rafael a landowner ricardo is in love with her too but is too easily influenced by his domineering mother leonora ends up homeless and travels to paris where she becomes a famous opera singer and develops the reputation for being a loose woman in reality part of her attitude is bitterness over rafael's abandonment br br she returns to her home to visit her family and eventually confronts rafael surprisingly no one knows that she's the famous la brunna and garbo acts up her role as the diva she truly was and re prised with such cool haughtiness in her later portrayals br br ricardo cortez reminds one a lot of valentino in looks in this part and he was groomed to be a valentino clone by mgm though he never thought he could be in reality and he was right he is believable in an unsympathetic part as a weak willed mama's boy and allows himself to age realistically but comically at the end of the movie he fails to win leonora when she returns home and later when he follows her his courage is undermined br br this movie is beautifully shot with brilliant storm sequences and the sets depicting spain at the time are authentic looking there are also some fine secondary performances by old timers lucien littlefield tully marshall and mack swain br br although this is a story of lost love and missed chances i don't think leonora and rafael would have been happy together as he needed a more traditional wife and she was very much a career woman and i don't think would have been happy in a small village the ending is true to life and pulls no punches br br see this one as garbo's american film debut and a precursor of things to come
i was amazingly impressed by this movie it contained fundamental elements of depression grief loneliness despair hope dreams and companionship it wasn't merely about a genius musician who hit rock bottom but it was about a man caught up in grief trying drastically to find solace within his music he finds a companion who comes with her own issues claire and des were able to provide each other with friendship and love but more importantly a conclusion to events which had shaped their life for the worst br br des is an unlikely character by todays standards of a rock star yet he has musical genius he also has an event in his past that has made him stagnate while things around him literally go to ruins his focus is creating his whale music in fact it becomes an obsession for him br br claire is the streetwise kid that needs a place to stay she finds hidden talents while being in des company she also finds a mutual friend that accepts her she learns to trust him over a period of time br br these two find love with one another not the mind blowing sex infused kind of passion but a love where friendship and understanding means more for two people who have been hurt they find trust together
chase has created a true phenomenon with the sopranos unfaltering performances rock solid writing and some great music make up what has become quite possibly the best show ever br br all of the cast are strong but falco and gandolfini earned every inch of those emmy's anyone who doubts this need only sample a few episodes particularly from the first few seasons james gandolfini is absolutely fierce absolutely terrifying and you still find yourself loving him mesmerized by him br br many people that i've spoken to about the sopranos who haven't seen it yet will say i'm just not a fan of mafia movies shows whatever run don't walk and get it those same people usually love e r but i bet they don't much care for hospitals it's not about the context
fred olen ray is a lousy director even as far as b movie directors go but 'haunting fear' is probably one of his better films yes it does butcher the great poe story 'premature burial' and yes it is badly paced and uneven throughout but it is also pretty entertaining scream queen brinke stevens is better than usual as a pretty fragile housewife whose worthless husband jay richardson is plotting to do away with her because he needs money to pay off a gangster played by robert quarry delia sheppard a veteran of many early 90s soft core movies actually gives the best performance in the film as a slutty mistress you will also enjoy small roles played by karen black as a psychic robert clarke as a doctor and michael berryman in a nice cameo in one of the better scenes the ending didn't make much sense
dr mordrid is terrifying i would not recommend any adult or child see this unless they are rampaging murderers already there is so much filth in this movie it hurts my yes speaking of eyes there are eyes in the sky against a backdrop of stars only the devil himself could have imagined such a wicked thing i rented out every copy i could from local video stores and crushed them with a 5 pound crucifix that movie should remain locked in a cellar behind the 4th dimension with all the other disgusting beasts of hell that is where this movie belongs i suggest if you want some scandalous entertainment go and rent all dogs go to heaven or angels in the outfield those movies are worth seeing if you want to commit a sin and love terrible movies you need to see dr mordrid
i don't know anything of the writer's or the director's earlier work so i hadn't brought any prejudices to the film based on the brief description of the plot in tv guide i thought it might be interesting br br but implausibility was piled upon implausibility each turn of the plot seemed to be an excuse to drag in more bloodshed gruesome makeup or special effects br br the score was professional and kari wuhrer seems like a decent actress but the rest was more than disappointing it was positively repulsive br br i will not go through the vagaries of the narrative but i'll give an example of what i think of as an excess of explicit gore br br chris mckenna goes to an isolated ranch house and pulls the frozen body of his earlier victim wendt out of the deep freeze mckenna had killed wendt by biting a chunk out of his neck now he feels he must destroy the evidence of his involvement in wendt's demise what are the cops going to do measure his bite radius mckenna unwraps wendt's head and neck from the freezer bag it's in takes an ax and begins to chop off wendt's head whack whack whack the bit of the ax keeps chipping away at wendt's neck the air is filled with nuggets of flying frozen flesh one of which drops on mckenna's head he brushes it off when he's done mckenna then takes the frozen head outside to a small fire he's built he sits the head on the ground squats next to it takes out some photos of a woman he's just killed and shows them to wendt's head remember her we could have really made it if it hadn't been for you guys he tells the head duke you've always liked bonfires haven't you he asks then he places the head on the fire we only get a glimpse of it burning but we can hear the fat sizzling in the flame br br i don't want this sort of garbage to be censored i'm only wondering who enjoys seeing this stuff br br there's no reason to go on with the rest of the movie well i'll mention one example of an implausibility since i brought the idea up mckenna has been kidnapped and locked in a dark bare shack he knows he's going to be clobbered half to death in the following days he's literally invited the heavies to do it what would you do in this poe like situation here's what mckenna does on what may turn out to be the last night of his life he finds a discarded calendar with a pin up girl on it and masturbates successfully give that man the medal of freedom br br a monster who looks like pizza the hut is thrown into some unnecessary flashbacks the camera is often hand held and wobbly the dialog has lines like life is a piece of s or else it's the best of all possible worlds it depends on your point of view use is made of a wide angle lens that turns ordinary faces into gargoyle masks a house blows up in an explosive fireball at the end while the hero mckenna walks towards us in the foreground br br some hero he is too he first kills a man for 13 000 by bashing him over the head several times with a heavy statue then a potted plant before finally tipping a refrigerator over onto the body this bothers him a little but not enough to keep him from insisting on payment then i hope i have the order straight he kills wendt by ripping out part of his neck then he kills the wife of his first victim by accident and blames the heavies for it although by almost any moral calculus they had nothing to do with it next he burns the head honcho baldwin alive then having disabled the two lesser heavies he deliberately blows them up though one of them isn't entirely unsympathetic and we're supposed to be rooting for mckenna br br these aren't cartoon deaths like those in the dirty harry movies either bang bang and you're dead these are slow and painful the first one the murder for 13 000 is done clumsily enough to resemble what might happen in real life it isn't really easy to kill another human being as hitchcock had demonstrated in torn curtain but that scene leads to no place of any importance br br some people might enjoy this especially those young enough to think that pain and death are things that happen only in movies some meretricious stuff on screen here
if you have read the book do not set your hopes high if you have not go read it and never watch the film it is strange to learn that toby young was actually involved a lot in the writing of the script as he claims himself in the post script of the book because the film is very different from the book br br what the film seems to be aiming at taking a rather thought provoking and entertaining piece that combines philosophical ideas with plain funny sarcasm and simplifying it so that everyone would understand it it achieves with perfection the film is full of bad and cheap jokes suitable for a sitcoms and has lost any meaningful message that it could have had br br you are better off not seeing it
spoilers of both this and the matrix follow br br i liked the original matrix a great deal it was not a deep movie despite fishburne's attempts to philosophize but it was fairly well paced fun and i have a soft spot for hong kong fights br br in the original neo was the secret life of the rather unhappy cube worker anderson by day corporate drone and by night brave hacker eventually he eventually is forced to choose between these lives by his actions does he become an outlaw fighting the machine or does he go back to the safe forgettable world he started in interestingly he discovers that once one is shorn of illusions life rather sucks he has his girl by his side and his boon companions but he eats processed swill dresses in sweats and lives in a truly skungy bit of machinery still the truth makes him free br br at least part of the fun of that first movie lay in the what if it were me questions raised in the viewer's mind what if i were capable of the impossible what if i were the one it does not even matter that much what you are the one example of with a cool title like that br br further agent smith made a wonderful bad guy as he embodied all of the fear of authority that we carry with us he was as unstoppable as a terminator and as merciless br br at the end of the matrix neo must return to the matrix to share his good news of freedom br br this movie fails to completely to carry through on the ideas of the original movie and it does so with such lack of gusto such poor scriptwriting and such poor editing that i cannot believe they had planned these changes when the dialog is at a fifth grade level with various long words dropped in randomly i find it hard to believe that they understand what they are saying br br my short list of characterization failures br br the oracle goes from mildly helpful if deceitful to utterly obstructionist without any real reason br br major personalities of the matrix are introduced without need the keymaster for example was a cute idea but just not that interesting a character br br fishburne loses his advisor role and gets nothing to replace it with br br the people of zion are not particularly likable nor would you really want them running the world br br special effects problems br br the fight scenes are pointless and intermitable in the matrix you felt neo could lose and that he had to become something greater in order to survive in the matrix reloaded he is merely the viewpoint character of a particularly poorly plotted video game br br the fight on the freeway looked quite fake and not that interesting br br pacing problems br br as i mentioned above the fight scenes were interminable br br the rave went on too long everyone in my row at the theater was looking at their watch not because we mind good dancing and good orgies but because we did not know about the people pictured nor did we care br br whatever hack wrote the creator's soliloquy should be blacklisted from the business it meandered used words that the scriptwriter clearly did not understand and was a waste of time and a pacing killer the creator's speech could have been done in a tenth the time and with more peril as zion exists to give rebels a place to go so they do not destroy the matrix there are now too many people who do not believe the matrix is in danger of crashing and killing every person hooked up to it further the earth cannot support even the people in zion let alone these others you may choose one person from zion to form the new zion while i wipe the memories of the people currently in the matrix br br instead we got a long drawn out bunch of twaddle if someone argues that it is deep ask for a transcript and try breaking down the sentences each one is too long by several clauses and uses words with clearer shorter synonyms br br so in summary not worth seeing br br i have seen the third one and despite what a number of reviewers have said skip it it does not save this turkey br br the reviewers who feel that the second and third movies were deep should go see some truly deep movies perhaps read a book or two on rhetoric and debate and perhaps a bit of philosophy this movie is just not hard to understand but it is hard to stomach br br scott
what a piece of junk this movie was the premise was okay but even in the beginning with crappy effects to blend in a giant with normal sized people even the effects in hercules was better i knew this would be bad but the really awful part of the movie is the dialogs it's completely incoherent silly and stupid i felt like it had been written by some 9th grader in creative class and gotten a d i want to slap casper van diem and the other actors for following this movie through br br i've had my share of cheesy and bad movies i love the tremors series but this i do not recommend it at all it's silly and the totally flabbergastingly bad dialogs will make you cringe
this movie is likely the worst movie i've ever seen in my life surpassing the previous most god awful movie spawn of slithis which i saw when i was about 10 br br bad acting stilted and ridiculous dialog incomprehensible plot mishmashed cut scenes even the music was annoying did i leave anything out well the special effects weren't bad but cgi does not a decent movie make br br i can't believe i actually spent money to see this movie if anyone has the contact info for hyung rae shim the director please forward it to my user name at gmail and i'll contact him to personally demand a refund
a new side to the story of victoria and albert is brought to life by director jean marc valle most people's cursory thoughts of queen victoria is that of woman who reigned for several decades and lived her life in mourning emily blunt is more than capable in the title role as she gives audiences a different perspective she portrays victoria in her youth ascension to the throne and early years blunt's victoria both fresh and restrained throughout the film her strongest scenes are with albert rupert friend and lord melbourne paul bettany all the actors acquit themselves well including miranda richardson in what could of been a throw away role br br though this is not a story of dramatic arcs and histrionic acting moments the story is still interesting enough to make it worth viewing there are a few historical liberties that has been taken by the screen writing the film tries to stay true to the relationship between victoria and albert and of the social and royal structure of the time period the set design and costumes are outstanding br br this film will be most appreciated by those drawn to history period dramas and of blunt and the other actors heartily recommend br br grade a
i dislike this movie a lot if you've read the puzo's books or at least have watched very closely the two first movies specially the first one you're going to agree with me br br compared with the corleone's saga presented by puzo's novel the script of this film is sometimes even ridiculous the characters and the relationships among them are distorted the story ends up reaching nowhere although it appears to go to some direction during the movie br br it is understandable that different times should be expected for the corleone's saga in the 90's and that we would not gonna find things the way they were before but in the other hand i don't know why they had to copy some dialogues from the other movies in contexts when they didn't fit why this it sounds like those poorly made sequels that just try to copy the original film's qualities br br what will never be understandable is the fact that mario puzo coppola and al pacino joined together to make this a man who directed pieces like apocalypse now and godfather has to be forgiven for almost anything he does in cinema until he dies so does al pacino for being the actor he is but mario puzo shouldn't have written this how come he damaged all his previous work what a shame my friend the puzo's novel the last don is a 90's story about the mob and it is great we can never tell the same about the plot for the godfather iii

anchors aweigh sees two eager young sailors joe brady gene kelly and clarence doolittle brooklyn frank sinatra get a special four day shore leave eager to get to the girls particularly joe's lola neither joe nor brooklyn figure on the interruption of little navy mad donald dean stockwell and his aunt susie kathryn grayson unexperienced in the ways of females and courting brooklyn quickly enlists joe to help him win aunt susie over along the way however joe finds himself falling for the gal he thinks belongs to his best friend how is brooklyn going to take this betrayal and does joe end up with susie who loves him too br br the first and second times i saw anchors aweigh i also saw it at the same time as i did on the town the kelly sinatra collaboration from 1949 both times i felt that anchors aweigh was the better film in terms of plotting and structure all the dances and songs fit the moment in the plot and they develop the characters and story rather than hamper them yet both times i came away feeling that on the town is the better film overall having now seen both films a third time i still stand by that judgement somehow on the town as a film and a piece of entertainment is just lighter gayer purely and simply happier the numbers are more outrageous and less integral to the plot and yet somehow it works better than all the dances and singing in anchors aweigh i'm not quite sure why this is the typical argument is that the latter film is over long at almost two and a half hours this is certainly a valid criticism to make i certainly felt the length the first two times i saw it however it's also a film that grows on you the more you see it the shorter it feels and the more you appreciate the technical mastery involved in its making and yet something just doesn't hang together quite right it feels almost as if the script was pored over and every single moment when kelly could break into dance or sinatra into song was noted and that's exactly what happened no opportunity to shoehorn a musical number in was given up and that's probably the film's biggest weakness it has 16 numbers give or take a few and no matter how big a fan you are of kelly or sinatra this really starts to turn one numb after a while contrast this for example with the ten numbers in on the town you might well feel that each song each dance can't be taken out of the film without leaving it lacking and that's true but that's also because the writers weren't more restrained in adding them in in the first place br br all this long preamble doesn't mean there's nothing good about anchors aweigh the musical is splashy with great songs bursting out all over like the duets between kelly and sinatra 'we hate to leave' 'i begged her' and 'if you knew susie' the singing of sinatra 'what makes the sunset' 'the charm of you' and the best of all 'i fall in love too easily' and without a doubt the always inventive always breathtaking dancing of kelly it's also hard to miss with a cast of this calibre grayson is sweet and seems to improve on each viewing her voice becoming stunning rather than frightening jose iturbi's role is written sympathetically and he does a great job with it even clarence's own brooklyn pamela britton is cute and charming as close as one could get to betty garrett without being garrett herself sinatra is adorable with those blue eyes and curls of his and plays the innocent boy man wonderfully a role he reprises in on the town his singing is as usual simply faultless from enunciation through to timing and phrasing his solo numbers might seem to drag a little but when you've got the voice of a century showcasing it is probably as good a reason as any to slow up the rest of the film br br gene kelly's sheer genius in this film is worthy of its own paragraph third in the billing behind sinatra and grayson respectively anchors aweigh really is kelly's film his joe brady is a believable real character he's tough on the outside glib and willing to lie when necessary to win a gal but he's actually the biggest softy on the inside kelly makes this charming rather than cloying but also gives joe a real edge that you see in the scene when joe chases brooklyn around the room with a genuinely murderous look on his face and his breakfast tray in his hands and the dancing again the film suffers from the 'too much of a good thing spoils the effect' syndrome as it does with sinatra's singing but once again if it's gene kelly doing the softshoe or tapping across the screen in a sailor's outfit or dressed up as a bandit chief might as well err on the side of overdoing it all of kelly's dances are breathtaking be it the pared down simplicity of his tap number with sinatra to 'i begged her' his 'mexican hat dance' with the sweet wide eyed little girl or his lavish spanish influenced dance 'la cumparsita' of course the classic image left in audiences' minds for all time would be kelly in his red white and blue sailor suit dancing with jerry mouse of 'tom jerry' fame a well deserved golden film memory to be sure it's not often that one can say you're impressed by the special effects in a film made in 1945 given the saturation of cgi in the contemporary film market but gene and jerry still look great with kelly always hitting his spots and looking exactly where he needs to look it would turn out that just about the only people who could really keep up with gene kelly would be kelly himself in cover girl and a cartoon animation br br it's doubtless that this first daring inventive kelly dance with jerry has reserved a place for anchors aweigh in film history and the hearts of classic film buffs but it's also notable for being the first of three kelly sinatra film collaborations and though rather too drawn out still a great couple of hours of entertainment watch it first then again and maybe again it'll grow on you before you realise it 7 5 10
the plot is plausible but banal i e beautiful and neglected wife of wealthy and powerful man has a fling with a psychotic hunk then tries to cover it up as the psycho stalks and blackmails her but what develops from there is stupefyingly illogical despite the resources that are available to the usual couple who has money and influence our privileged hero and heroine appear to have only one domestic their attorney and local police who say they can do nothing at their disposal while they grapple with suspense and terror they have no private security staff only a fancy security system that they mishandle household or grounds staff chauffeurs etc not even apparently the funds to hire private round the clock nurses to care for the hero when he suffers life threatening injuries leaving man and wife alone and vulnerable in their mansion our heroine is portrayed as having the brains of a doorknob and our hero a tycoon behaves in the most unlikely and irrational manner the production is an insult to viewers who wasted their time with this drivel and a crime for having wasted the talents of veteran actors oliva hussey and don murray what were they thinking and shame on lifetime tv for insulting the intelligence of its audience for this insipid offering
john water's pink flamingos pecker is the best movie i've seen in a while it gives the viewer a surreal image of life in baltimore i live in nearby washington dc with a warhol like use of color exaggerated motions and emotions pecker becomes larger than his town can handle and he is separated from his loved ones including a sexy ricci by his man loving art manager the picture left a refreshing taste in my mouth kind of like a fresh strawberry ice cream on a hot summer day and though this taste was rather flat and simplistic it only made the whole thing more profound and critical it is a celebration of life liberty and the right to bear arms and everything else this country stands for juan pieczanski jpieczanski sidwell edu
road to perdition can be summed up by thomas newman's score it's haunting and beautiful but you're aware that this music is similar to newman's other work and while listening to the soundtrack you're reminded of scent of a woman meeting joe black and the shawshank redemption you're reminded of other films as the story unfolds on screen as the sullivans drive round america trying to escape from a psychotic hit man you think of the getaway irish gangsters is miller's crossing whilst the subtext of guilt and redemption can be summed up by coppola and leone's gangster epics despite having a seen it all before feel this shouldn't be taken as a heavy criticism of sam mendes film which i repeat is haunting and beautiful and the only flaws that work against it is a very slow opening twenty minutes and i was slightly confused as the events that caused michael sullivan to be betrayed but if you stop to consider how much of a sentimental mess spielberg might have made with the story that revolves around a father and his twelve year old son running for their lives you can't help thinking what a superb director mendes is br br road to perdition is a film where the entire cast give flawless performances i've never been all that keen on tom hanks but he's every bit as good here as he has been in any starring role probably better paul newman plays a character with an irish accent but at no point did i believe i was watching an american screen legend putting on a false accent newman's performance works due to the subtle body language his character is torn up by guilt but newman never milks it or goes over the top while never upstaging newman who gives the best performance in the movie the two brit supporting actors craig and law are also very memorable as american gangsters and while law will still have a long career as a leading actor one wonders how daniel craig might have progressed as a character actor if he hadn't decided to become james bond a role which heralds the end of an actors career
i watched this movie and the original carlitos way back to back the difference between the two is disgusting now i know that people are going to say that the prequel was made on a small budget but that never had anything to do with a bad script now maybe it's just me but i always thought that a prequel was made to go set up the other movie starring key characters and maybe filling in a bit about life that we didn't know rise to power is just a movie that has carlito's name there should have been at least a few characters from the original movie the ending makes no sense in relation to the original in the end of this movie he retires with his sweet heart but how the hell do we get him coming out of prison in the next movie and his woman isn't even the same woman that he talks about as his only love in the original i would say the movie is mildly entertaining in its self with a few decent bits but it pales when held up to it's big brother don't lay awake at night waiting to see this watch the original one more time if you really need a hit
spoilers included br br with a title like bleed you know the creative juices weren't running on high when this puppy was conceived the movie is your basic run of the mill low budget slasher movie oh sure it tries to be creative with the premise of the murder club but we learn that was just a joke anyways okay for those who really care about these things the basic plot is that new girl in town starts dating her co worker he invites her into his circle of friends and at a party they tell her how they have a murder club and they murder people blah blah blah well we learn that it was all a joke but not before our heroine kills a lady in a parking garage now the members of the murder club are being killed one by one oh and the bad guys wins and the movie ends on a downer by that time you won't really care though br br in retrospect the first 10 or so minutes of this movie make no sense the motivation for the killings in the beginning of the movie is never explained i would say that it was a way for the director to pad out the film but on the dvd there are deleted scenes i'm not sure why anyone would want to see more than the feature length version of bleed but apparently the people behind the dvd thought the viewers would be clamoring for more on the box it says there are easter eggs but why the hell i would want to waste my time looking for extras on this movie is beyond me br br i was expecting a bad movie and bleed delivered on that front it wasn't a fun bad movie though everyone looks good in the movie and there's plenty of nudity but the acting is just awful my least favorite character is the guy who ends up being the killer i think he's supposed to be funny and amusing but he just ends up coming off as a tool i think the funniest moment of the movie is when our heroine kills the lady in the parking garage in a hilariously unconvincing death heroine shoves the women into the parking garage cement pole and the woman looks like she barely hits the thing and she spits out a mouthful of blood and dies br br for those who think that movie making is an intricate creative process done by professionals check out bleed it will change your mind and you'll realize any hack get can a movie made br br otherwise don't waste your time or money on this
this film is a calculated attempt to cash in the success of sex in the city and four weddings and a funeral in fact if they'd called it sex at a funeral they might have done better at the box office br br but the film falls between two stools and can't get up the characters spout improbably bright dialog but never act in any way remotely recognizable as human one arbitrary senseless action follows another to advance what passes for a plot and one soon tires of the falsity of the whole enterprise br br andie macdowell gets points for acting her little heart out but the performing honors are stolen by imelda staunton as of all things a police detective don't they have a height requirement over there ms staunton seems unable to make a false move would that we could say the same about the writer director br br if notting hill annoyed you as being bogus stay away from this one phonus bolognus on the half shell
this has to be the worst movie i have seen madsen fans don't be drawn into this like i was he is only in it for a maximum of five minutes this movie is so bad that the only reason why you would watch it is if all the rest of the movies on earth as well as t v had been destroyed
in the year 1985 my birth year steven spielberg directed an emotionally strong and unforgettable story of a young african american girl celie debut role for whoopi goldberg whose life is followed through rough times the story begins from the year 1909 when celie is only 14 years old she has given birth two children for her father celie has a younger sister nettie with whom she is inseparable a widower lays his eyes on nettie but their father gives celie to him it is the beginning of an era of horrible abuse and constant controlling women are inferior of men and especially being an african american woman their rights are less than a zero celie's story is a true survival story br br the color purple is a master piece and underestimated film of spielberg he should make more drama which the color purple and schindler's list are good notion br br the cast is amazing whoopi goldberg is known better as a ravingly funny comedienne but the introducing role as celie is a remarkable word that she really can pull of heavy drama danny glover was surprisingly nasty mister i have never seen him in a such an evil role the talk show icon oprah winfrey is brilliant as a strong willed sofia br br warning prepare to have a number of tissues with you when watching this film you can really connect to the story of the strong sisterhood especially if you have as close relationship with your siblings like i have with my sister br br big applauds to mr spielberg
i've never really considered myself much of student when it comes to watching films i watch them form an opinion and that's it but unhinged changed all this this film is without a doubt the most inept attempt at film making i've ever seen every kid who rocks up at university thinking they're gonna be the next spielberg or tarantino needs to be handed this film with a handbook titled how not to make a film not only is there no story to be had the film makers weren't even competent enough to make a film worth watching it's been a while since i saw it but all i can say is watch the overhead tracking shots in the opening scenes they are never ending it's almost like having your teeth pulled only not as much fun
the movie was a huge disappointment especially since it was directed by priyadarshan it was sad to see such dismal standards poor screenplay almost non existent and song sequences with bad songs every minute and at the most odd times killed whatever humor the movie could offer some of the scenes were funny but it amounted to probably only 5 mins of the whole duration the editing was pathetic dismal overall the movie disappointed as the lack of story was only too evident in fact only a few people stayed to watch the second half of the movie after the interval br br one wouldn't miss anything at all if you don't watch the movie not worth spending valuable ticket money on this movie wait till it appears on tv
nothing 3 outta 5 stars another weird premise from the director of the movie cube this time around there are two main characters who find themselves and their home transported to a mysterious white void there is literally nothing outside of their small two story house intriguing to be sure but i thought the comedic tone established for this movie from the get go was extremely ill conceived there needs to be some humour certainly and i have no problem with the humour that was eventually derived from the plight of our two heroes their final showdown was definitely a hoot but i really think the movie would have been a lot better off if it had stayed more rooted in reality in the beginning after watching the movie i watched the making of feature on the dvd and a short trailer at the end is almost totally devoid of the sillier comedic aspects making it look like a completely different and slightly better movie the last half hour of the movie is where things really start to come together similar in a way to the recent movie primer the actors are fine when they are not overdoing the comedy shtick they are really quite believable in their more normal moments i was probably ready to write this movie off as a failed experiment at the midway point but it won me over by the end and keep watching past the credits for the final scene just don't ask me to explain it
every time i watch this movie i am more impressed by the whole production i have come to the conclusion that it is the best romantic comedy ever made everyone involved is perfect script acting direction sets and editing whilst james stewart can always be relied upon for a good performance and the supporting cast are magnificent it is margaret sullavan who reveals what an underrated actress she was her tragic personal life give poignancy to her qualities as a performer where comedy acting skills are not easy to achieve lubitsch managed to get the best and he obviously gave his best watch for the number of scenes which were done on one take breathtaking
i enjoyed the movie very much emotionally intellectually and visually it contains no violence or sex or drugs or special effects and doesn't need them one bit holding my attention the entire time with the visuals story and interspersed words of wisdom br br however 1 some of the foreign language accents made the dialog difficult to hear understand 2 there is unnecessary overuse of swearing especially the f word which is the only reason this movie was rated r 3 the movie is balanced with humor and emotion but most of the emotion that holds you throughout the film except the final resolution last minutes is unpleasant due to the exaggerated long lasting dysfunctional reaction of some of the characters to loss living in the depths of bitterness and depression for too long 4 i will not recommend this movie because of 5 seconds of background narration which did not add one bit to the side character it applied to or the film it only turned me off to the movie and stuck in my brain through the whole movie and afterward the main character's mother of german ancestry when watching old wwii movies secretly roots for the germans there would be no local color or art if the nazi's won the war i don't know of any germans today except radical skinheads who think the world would be a better place if the nazi's won wwii
hi i consider just cause one of my favorite sean connery's movies it is a tense psychological thriller with excellent performances from the cast especially connery it also has one of the best lines i have seen in movies so the dialog is pretty good in this one it also has one of the best scenes in movies ever when sean interviews ed harris's character in prison is just fantastic i enjoyed this one a lot and i can not recommend this enough really do not miss this one do not pay attention to the negative reviews stating that the last 30 minutes suck it was as intense as the rest of the movie i really find just cause a very entertaining movie
i cannot say this movie is a disappointment because i read some reviews before watching and it did not do as well as i thought it would have the bar was not set that high so the fact that my expectations were met is not saying much br br the good the city of new york if you live in the city like me you'll recognize certain places and understand that the city is supposed to be more than just a setting rather one of the main characters there are genuinely tender moments humorous conversations and plot twists left and right which all keep things interesting br br the bad the first thing i thought after leaving the theater was that i wanted more but not in the positive leave them wanting more fashion certainly the good skits scenes outweigh the bad but there are a lot of skits that fall within the in between category too many in fact which is what ultimately brings the movie down also new york city's diversity though hinted at though the many distant pans of the city and mentioned in conversation throughout the movie is never really realized or analyzed to the point of doing the city justice for example many of the skits involve well to do middle aged whites i mean i know the city is home to many of the said demographic but come on paris je'taime's plot and character diversity makes new york city look like lancaster pa or someplace really white it is just disappointing to see the city shortchanged on its heritage like that br br still even after having said this i would recommend giving new york i love you a view who knows maybe you'll disagree with my opinion and maybe you won't you will never know until you see it for yourself this review is not meant to deter anyone from watching this movie as everyone's opinion on art differs i'm just giving you a very vague heads up on what to expect
i saw the long day's dying when it first came out at the cinema i thought the film gave a good soldiers point of view it gave a realistic account of men at war the storyline moves at a nice pace showing a group of men behind enemy lines and trying to return back to their own lines with an enemy prisoner the characters are well developed and believable br br david hemmings is a good actor and plays the leading role with conviction as does alan dobie as german helmut i was surprised that i have been unable to find this film on vhs or dvd and i feel it has become the forgotten film which is sad as it is superior to many other war films i have seen
'capital city' fans rejoice this first season of this series is now available from network dvd and i've recently got my copy although very much an ensemble piece of key 'maverick' trading floor characters 'capital city' does present us with various moments through both its first and second season when each member of the team plays a significant part in a particular central or peripheral plot line the cultural mix english irish american german polish of head trader wendy foley's played by joanna phillips lane group of staff is balanced with their own distinctive mannerisms interests and personalities which helps to make the rather unfamiliar and to most people seemingly sterile subject of financial trading reasonably engaging through the engaging performances of the cast in fact this seemingly dynamic young team of employees is in direct contrast to the rather staid and old fashioned senior management of shane longman as represented by lee wolf richard le parmentier and james farrell denys hawthorne i suspect that such an unconventional way of working as employed by wendy's team would not have become a reality had it not been for youthful reclusive 'free spirit' peter longman inheriting his thirty per cent stock in the company from his father and allowed a more trendy relaxed modern way of business become a reality to a certain degree wendy's i am led to believe immediate supervisor leonard ansen john bowe follows the establishment in the traditional manner of running the company however his fondness for wendy rather sees him occupying the 'middle ground' on most occasions the main interest in the series i believe stems from the simmering romantic attraction between douglas hodge's declan and the cool self assured blonde haired german trader michelle hauptmann played by trevyn mcdowell which had viewers continually wondering if the situation between these two colleagues would develop beyond the close friendship fondness that they undoubted have br br looking forward to browsing through this title and hopefully the second season of thirteen won't be too far away
yowza if anyone who loves laurel and hardy can watch this movie and feel good about it you're a better person than me this movie while a great attempt at 'imitating' laurel and hardy through appearance sound and routine falls very short of honoring them or even being a movie of any substance i blame larry harmon dialogue is torn from old l h movies and planted in unrealistically the plot is muddled with useless characterization of the other needless co stars pinchot's accent was bizarre for stan and while sartain did an excellent job with ollie's accent he tried too hard to create the wonderful mix that was mr hardy where was a good musical number editing is choppy acting is stiff lines are horrid physics are implausable although perhaps they were trying to give it that feel of cheap sets and overall it's a terrible thing to witness it's even more painful to watch than atoll k where the legendary duo did their last film in awful 1950's era writing and photography do yourself a favor and watch as much of the original laurel and hardy films as you can and learn how things were you know what a magnate is don't you stan laurel did not perpetually reply with semi moronic quips at every sentence br br i pity anyone who thinks that this was a decent update honor of the boys where was the classic theme song why ruin 'here's another fine mess' why skip 'any the wiser' why was there a pointless gaggle of co stars why miss gulch from the wizard of oz why must larry harmon be in it why bozo and did the learning channel help fund the thing br br i mean really fart jokes for god's sake br br fart jokes
this has to be one of the worst films i have ever seen without a doubt the only thing interesting in this film is the cameo appearances from some great genre directors and king himself the film has a great premise but falls apart about 15 minutes into the story i did like madchen amick in this film and think she could have a very good career in film
another variation and improvisation on the famous and beloved children tale la bete 1975 aka the beast tries to imagine in very graphic and what may seem offensive and disturbing but in reality rather silly and comical way what actually happened between beauty and the beast i am amused by many reviews and comments that seem to look too deeply into this movie i would not go so far as saying that it is a serious and dark exploration of such subjects as sexual frustration longing fulfillment or satirical criticizing of the catholic religion i would not even call it a horror erotic movie it's more of the parody on all genres it touches or mentions even though it's got some shocking moments in all departments that sure will stay in your memory br br the long way too long scene between an aristocratic young woman and the supposedly horrifying but the most laughable i've ever seen in the movies creature with truly impressive well anatomy is set to the clavichord music of scarlatti and is hysterical my husband and i both laughed out loud at the exaggerated details of the encounter the moral of the scene is beauty can and will defeat the monster the question is who is the target audience for the film for an erotic picture it is too verbose for an art movie it's got too many jaw dropping scenes of sheer madness and i'd say an abrupt ending imo the film creator did not mean for it to be a serious drama as a parody of art house horror erotica it is funny and certainly original have a good laugh and try not to look for some deep meaning this story of the curious beauties and the lustful beasts certainly is not recommended for co viewing with the children the opening scene that may shock an unprepared viewer much more than the infamous scene of bestiality can be successfully used on discovery channel for the program like in the world of animals mating habits and rituals of horses
shecky is a god damned legend make no mistake until recently i worked for a uk hifi video retail chain running their testing department we would go through many new starters they would be expected to to learn how to fault find the various detritus that returns as non functional in one way or another from the stores now to tortu test the resolve of these new staff members we would issue them with a copy of going overboard we had hundreds of copies of this film because whenever someone who had bought a particular model of goodmans dvd player that had this film as a free gift got round to sending their dvd player back they never failed to send shecky back also our new staff would be forced to use only going overboard to test these machines for faults until they had found a disc or two of their own to test with br br now as to why this film is so bad where do i begin br br adam sandler who can be so so very funny as in happy gilmore or the wedding singer must have been having one hell of an off day the rest of the crew stank and what is it with billy zane his name crops up in several of the worst movies of all time and he is a decent actor crazy the production quality is absolute zero br br i would have been inclined to give this a zero if i could because they didn't even have the guts to call it by it's full name 'the unsinkable shecky moskowitz' on release even so it is worth a watch so you can see just how far sandler has come and just how low he can go
elvis presley plays a half breed native american indian who has to defend his reservation from nasty business tycoons everyone likes to get drunk fight and make children fighting wrestling and punching out each other replace the stereotypical hand raised expression how br br although he does have make up on it's obvious elvis is healthier than he appeared in prior films possibly he was getting ready for his famous comeback it couldn't have been because this movie's script was anything to get excited about joan blondell trying to seduce elvis and burgess meredith in war paint should be ashamed br br the best song is stay away actually green sleeves with different lyrics the most embarrassing song is elvis' love song to the bull dominic there are some surreal scenes but it never becomes trippy enough to succeed in that genre though stay away joe might provide some laughs if you're in the right mood br br otherwise stay away br br stay away joe 1968 peter tewksbury elvis presley burgess meredith joan blondell
i think this is a lovely family movie there are plenty of hilarious scenes and heart warming moments to be had throughout the movie the actors are great and the effects well executed throughout danny glover plays george knox who manages the terrible baseball team 'the angels' and is great throughout the film also fantastic are the young actors joseph gordon levitt and milton davis jr christopher lloyd is good as al 'the angel' and the effects are great in this top notch disney movie a touching and heart warming movie which everyone should enjoy
wow this was another good spin off of the original american pie not as good as band camp but definitely a lot better the naked mile dwight and erik stifler lead the comedy in this one but i actually preferred the dialogue in this one to the naked mile the script was written a lot better and the comedy flowed more smoothly however most of the comedy came from sex but that's okay because that's why we watch these movies anyway right br br the midget rock also had a really good cameo considering the intense effort given by him in the naked mile his scene with stifler was awesome and had me laughing my ass off when i saw it br br the movie was a definite improvement in my opinion compared to the naked mile if you liked any previous american pie films you should like beta house unless you view all of the american pie spin offs a waste of money
sure he became rapidly uneven after this film but from knife in the water up till the tenant roman polanski could always be counted on to deliver something fascinating and unique despite many running themes alienation paranoia no two of his films are really alike the story of this is somewhat similar to his own repulsion from ten years earlier but the tone is completely different the tenant manages to balance darker than dark absurdity i'm a bit hesitant on calling it humor even though the protagonists bizarre behavior and dialog was occasionally funny with some truly suspenseful paranoia polanski was always a master at building unease and moments in this film are almost unbearably creepy the overall weirdness of the film is also a plus br br in addition to polanski's exquisite as usual direction the rest of the cast and crew offer great contributions polanski the actor is often overshadowed by polanski the director but his performance here truly captures his characters awkwardness and sense of being an outcast the themes of social discrimination make this film more than just strangeness for the sake of being strange the rest of the cast offers strong performances also especially isabelle adjani's sympathetic turn and melyvn douglas and shelley winters' appropriately annoying ones the tenant is often underrated because of how ready people are to heap praise on both repulsion and rosemary's baby but its just as brilliant as either of those classics 9 10
actually this flick made in 1999 has pretty good production values the actors are attractive and reasonably talented there aren't a bunch of clowns running around blasting away expending hundreds of rounds but never hitting flesh nor are there wild car chases crashes where thousands of dollars worth of beautiful machines are uselessly trashed br br the interiors look respectably modern architecturally and the equipment looks up to snuff well there is that high tech computer room furnished with what look like leftovers from a '50s electronics lab and the pancake make up on the corpses cracked me up not pancake make up in the conventional sense but what looks like dried pancake batter slathered over their exposed skin this is supposed to support the idea that the bodies have calcified though how the virus would accomplish this transmutation is an exercise left for the student viewer br br ah yes the virus i would like to tell you that this is not the absolute worst premise for a sci fi horror flick i know of but i can't a computer virus that is transmitted via a television or computer monitor screen and becomes a lethal biological pathogen gimme a break warp drives a la star trek are one thing but photons becoming viruses this is so silly the desired fright factor just isn't realizable the flick could have used one of those awful dream sequences where the dead come alive or have a cat jump out of the closet or something because the viral thingamajig isn't doing it br br one presumes robert wagner has the same excuse for playing in this inanity that lord oliver gave for some of his later trashy venues he needed the money no other comparison between the two should be construed however
we should all congratulate uwe boll he's done the unthinkable he may be the only director to have two movies in the bottom 100 on imdb he's like some kind of cinematic cockroach no matter how little talent he has and no matter how bad these movies are he manages to keep making them i know he finances them all himself through some kind of bizarre german fund but even so his ability to keep making movies despite absolute complete failure is one of the great mysteries of the universe br br it wouldn't be so bad except that video game developers keep giving their best properties to this guy i really enjoyed the alone in the dark series of games even the latest one the new nightmare was good for a few hours of game play there was a good movie to be made out of edward carnby's adventures but this is not it now uwe boll has gotten his hands on bloodrayne and hunter the reckoning what's next silent hill doom i can only imagine the swath that this guy is going to cut through game to movie adaptations if he's not stopped someone needs to take away his line of credit or these video game publishers need to wise up and realize that when they make a bad movie out of a game that kills the franchise no one is interested in that title any more br br think about it is house of the dead or alone in the dark a viable game title anymore no way a new house of the dead game comes out for x box and nobody's gonna care the title is dead and all because of uwe boll so if any of you out there work for a game publisher or know a game publisher or have access to a game publisher please warn them br br this movie itself is not even worth reviewing i can't separate what i didn't like about this pile of dung from the rest of it literally everything about it sucks the writing the acting the music the cg effects the editing i thought that if i waited until it came out on dvd and then rented it with low expectations i wouldn't be disappointed boy was i wrong never underestimate uwe's ability to turn out a big steaming pile of boll sh t
spoilers strange people with generous tastes have been reviewing this film allow me to add balance by pointing out the following br br script dreadful as tom and dan are getting to know each other bantering about films the talk is clearly that of one person and i suspect it was the director who carefully worked his words to sound intelligent at one point dan asks have you heard of the hiv virus and it sounds about as natural as asking have you communicated with the nine alien races br br acting white teeth do and a chiseled face do not a sensitive performer make speedman did well enough with what he was given i suppose but marsden was terrible unsympathetic unbelievable and downright smug and smarmy throughout his captivity there is an emptiness to his performances also see interstate 60 br br plot spare me the moments of half escape were not thrilling but irritating and weak recall marsden pretending to try keys in the door and then throwing them down they don't work man tee hee and beware the semi black and white flashbacks which are initiated with some schlocky sound taken from csi and other crime dramas br br most important of all most dangerous evil and offensive is the homophobia external or internal you decide in a film in which hiv is considered a weapon tom says that dan may have taken off the condom or not used it at all excuse me where was tom while they were having sex there is some villainizing of the inserting partner which comes off as a villainizing of the gay man in general br br in sum beware
the first one was the best the second one sucked because the dialog was terrible although the storyline wasn't so bad in fact all story lines are good and bad throughout the movie i dosed off a few times i know that jackie chan is a great martial arts expertise but not a good actor in rush hour 2 chris tucker too wasn't good and zhang ziyi what can i say a few lines terrible acting but that's based on her script all the characters there were not that good but some of the things i like in rush hour 2 is always the action and less sex scenes i know that jackie chan doesn't do those things which is good for him
maybe i'm really getting old but this one just missed me and the old funny bone completely surely there must be something powerful wrong with this irishman that's me schultz lordy lordy what i would give to see the light firstly that phil silvers manic energy wit and drive was very much a part of the comedic upbringing and overall education in life if you will although it is possible that the series first titled you'll never get rich 1955 59 could have gotten on the cbs tv network with someone else in the title role of sgt bilko it is very hard to picture any other actor comedian in the business wearing those master sergeant's stripes br br such a strong identification is inescapable though not the same sort of career wrecking typecasting of a nightmare that it proved to be to some other guys like clayton more the lone ranger george reeves the adventures of superman and charles nelson riley uncle croc's block br br one major stumbling block to successfully adapting and updating such a work from the 1950's tv screen to the 1990's movie going public is our collective memory without being sure about what percentage of the crowd remembered the bilko character from seeing the original run and early syndication revivals and their numbers were surely considerable even a large segment of the young had seen bilko reruns in recent times it was obvious that the new film and the source were miles or even light years apart br br so as not to be thought of as a totally square old grouch please let's consider some other points br br right here today the 14th day of november in the year of our lord 2007 let me swear and affirm under oath that i have been a steve martin fan for nearly 30 years furthermore i've enjoyed the wit and talents of bilko '96 co stars dan akroyd and the late phil hartman after all it was the talents of guys like this and so many others alumni of nbc s saturday night and second city tv that kept the last quarter of the 20th century laughing but a bilko re make it just didn't click br br perhaps if the film had been made as a service comedy always liked 'em but without the bilko show names and gave it some identity of it self it would be more highly regarded by crabby old guys like me br br so we've already had so many sitcom and cartoon series turned into movies lately what's next howse about somebody doing hal roach's world war ii army comedy series of sergeants doubleday ames and tv's 1st cartoon series crusader rabbit remember where you heard it first poodle schnitz
for anyone who may not know what a one actor movie was like this is the best example this plot is ridiculous and really makes no sense it's full of cliched situations hackneyed lines melodrama comedy you name it br br but amitabh bachchan can make anything convincing and this movie is by no means an exception everyone turns in a decent performance shashi kapoor waheeda rehman ranjit om prakash smita patil but it is the megastar who overshadows everyone with his towering presence without him this movie would have been a non starter the story is about separation mistaken identities misunderstandings love hate loyalty good vs evil everything really amitabh's is a brilliant performance on all counts in an otherwise silly film and did i mention that it is ridiculously funny
beforehand notification i'm sure someone is going to accuse me of playing the race card here but when i saw the preview for this movie i was thinking finally i have yet to see one movie about popular african influenced dance be it popular hip hop moves breaking or stepping where the main character was a black woman i've seen an excessive amount of movies where a non black woman who knew nothing about hip hop comes fresh to the hood and does a mediocre job of it breakin breakin 2 save the last dance step up but the black women in the film are almost nonexistent that always bothered me considering so much of hip hop african influenced dance and breaking was with blacks and latinos in massive amounts in these particular sets and it wasn't always men who performed it so i felt this movie has been a long time coming however the race does not make the film so i also wanted it to carry a believable plot the dancing be entertaining and interesting to watch br br pros i really enjoyed this film bringing jamaican culture i can't recall ever seeing a popular mainstream film where all the main characters were jamaican had believable accents and weren't stereotypical with the beanies the steppers family friends and even the thugs were all really intelligent realistic people who were trying to love live and survive in the neighborhood they lived in by doing something positive even when the audience was made aware that the main character's sister chose an alternate lifestyle it still didn't make the plot stereotypical i was satisfied with the way it was portrayed i loved the stepping the romantic flirty relationship going on between two steppers the trials that the main character's parents were going through and how she dealt with coming back to her old neighborhood and dealing with crabs in a barrel i respected that she was so intelligent and active at the same time and so many other sistas in the film were handling themselves in the step world they were all just as excellent as the fellas i don't see that in too many movies nowadays at least not those that would be considered black films br br cons i'm not quite sure why the directors or whoever put the movie together did this but i question whether they've been to real step shows whenever the steppers got ready to perform some hip hop song would play in place of the steppers' hand feet beats at a real step show there is zero need for music other than to maybe entertain the crowds in between groups and then when hip hop songs were played sometimes the beat to the song was off to the beat of the steppers' hands and feet it was awkward i was more impressed with the stepping in this movie versus stomp the yard another great stepping movie because the women got to represent as fierce as the guys in stomp the yard meagan good got all of a few seconds of some prissy twirl and hair flip and the deltas let out a chant and a few steps and were cut immediately even when there were very small scenes the ladies tore it up especially in the auto shop and it was without all that music to drown out their physical music i know soundtracks have to be sold but the movie folks could've played the music in other parts of the film br br i'm not a keyshia cole fan so every time i saw her all i kept thinking was is it written in the script for her to constantly put her hand on her hip when she talks she looked uncomfortable on screen to me i thought they should've used a host like free or rocsi instead deray davis was funny as usual though also i groaned when i found out that the movie was supposed to be in the ghetto like stepping couldn't possibly happen anywhere else hollywood as usual however only a couple of people were portrayed as excessively ignorant due to their neighborhood and losers which mainstream movies tend to do br br i would've given this movie five stars but the music playing killed it for me i definitely plan to buy it when it comes out and hopefully the bonus scenes will include the actual step shows without all the songs
gone with the wind is one of the most overrated movies in history it is a film loved by mothers grandmothers and shut ins who go to the movies once every five years as a zombie movie it blows there isn't a shambling corpse in sight and it's terribly light in the gore department zombie 3 on the other hand is big on shambling corpses and quite generous with its blood spilling therefore it is better than gone with the wind it is also not overrated most reviewers are under no delusions that it is rubbish it is however not boring rubbish after a terrorist steals a virus he drops it while being pursued by a helicopter and the chemicals leak into the ground the terrorist who has been exposed to the nasty concoction hides in a hotel room where he slowly morphs into a flesh eating zombie one of his first victim's is a cleaning lady once she's bitten lucio fulci's brand of hell breaks loose as usual for a fulci flick the acting is atrocious the storyline is riddled with plot holes and the gore is plentiful turns out the film was directed by fulci and bruno mattei so that explains its rather schizophrenic nature it is badly shot too poorly edited and the sound design is flat still it is saved by its gleeful adherence to the goriest of murders and its impatient pacing definitely worth picking up if you're an undead completest or don't like gone with the wind undoubtedly the worst zombie movie of all time
as usual sean connery does a great job lawrence fishburn is good but i have a hard time not seeing him as ike turner
i saw this movie with my dad i must have been pretty young around 15 it was on star movies one afternoon the movie started a bit vaguely but you could tell those robbers were gathering up for a score it really caught pace after the first half hour br br all the actors are great especially blades and lou diamond i guess it's the ensemble they just play so well together i can watch this film anytime i think it is the relative stupidity of the plot and the characters trying to deal with a very weird score the jokes are not corny but they are subtle and extreme at the same time that make them so hilarious br br a perfect comedy for a lazy afternoon
i remember watching this film back in 86' when it first came out what an awful film the acting was atrocious the plot was so flimsy it would or is that should have blew away in a breath of wind i think it put me to sleep on more than one occasion i was not tired that i remember please avoid at all costs better still have all your teeth taken out with no anaesthetic cos that would be more entertaining it's just a pity i couldn't give it a zero or a negative score i wish i had not wasted my money getting this one from the video shop all i can say was that the tape it was on was still brand new practically hardly surprising as the film was so poor if i remember right i sat watched it with a girl i really wanted to go out with the fact she was sat next to me was still not enough to keep me awake thats how bad this film was
spoiler alert br br i love tim roth i really do and he does his best with an unbelievable role i can see how this is a movie that might look good as a script but it's convoluted unlikely and ultimately silly i saw the fake death ending coming a mile away rene z tries hard with an underwritten part and so does patricia arquette the detective whose name i can't remember the one that's not chris penn is a big sweaty over actor see it if you're not smart enough to differentiate between a movie being so clever you can't follow it and so confusing you can't understand it see it if you like cheesy camera work that makes you seasick see it if you love to watch tim roth work with an unwieldy script see it if it comes on late at night for free otherwise rent the usual suspects
this alec guinness starrer is a very good fun political satire of corporate industry and a light eccentric character study as well br br the pacing is a bit slow for a comedy and none of it is really rolling on the floor type funny except perhaps the sound effects for the experiments but it does have its amusing moments and it is very deft in its execution the big explosions segment is probably the most farcical element br br the union procedures are quite droll very reminiscent of i'm all right jack especially the feminine socialist with a light romantic crush on guinness' character the political machinations actually carry the story ernest thesigner is very notable as a heavy br br i don't think this one works quite as well as the ladykillers or kind hearts and coronets but even light ealing comedy is better than nothing
i love this film the songs and story lines are great fun and the song saying goodbye always moves me what a brilliant thing to do to bring puppets to life in a way that you actually care about these things made of cloth and fabric and whatever great voices and great talent why were all the other muppet films that came after this one so much less interesting moving and funny is it that mr henson is just so very missed
the name cult movie is often given to films which continue to be screened or to sell in home movie format more than a generation after they were first released superchick which was first released in 1973 now comes into this category its cult status is largely due to ongoing interest in it by those women who regard it as an early and effective feminist film br br despite the superwoman connotation superchick is not a cartoon character but a very competent young lady working as an air stewardess a career option which in the 1970's was commonly regarded as one of the most glamorous open to any girl and which also enables her to emulate the traditional matelot who reputedly has a wife in every port since she holds black belt status in karate she is in a position to make it quite clear that she is very happy with her bachelor existence and is in no way beholden to any of her extensive suite of male admirers this film is a situation comedy which avoids the generally much shorter lived appeal of outright farce its appeal to feminists is also heightened by a climax in which our heroine uses her karate abilities to avert a hijacking and save all the other passengers on her plane from a potentially unpleasant fate to ensure that this film will appeal to men as well as to their partners the director has wisely ensured that is liberally sprinkled with eye candy br br superchick can be enjoyed by those who are not too critical and want a very light easy to watch comedy which they will forget soon after viewing it is so forgettable that they will probably find it equally enjoyable if watched again in a year's time despite its age it may therefore retain its status as a cult movie for some time to come however the dialogue and acting would make it hard to give this film a rating of more than 4 10
this film is an excellent military movie it may not be an excellent hollywood movie but that does not matter hollywood has a reputation of sacrificing accuracy for good entertainment but that is not the case with this movie other reviewers have found this movie to be too slow for their taste but  as a retired soldier  i appreciate the pace the movie crew deliberately took to tell their story as completely as possible given the two hours and nine minutes allotted the story itself has been told and retold several times over but it remains for a professional soldier  and an african american at that  to report on the story as presented by the movie crew and as it presents the us navy to the world the story of brashear's work to become a navy diver and his life as a navy diver beyond his graduation is not the only story that is presented there i also the story of how master chief petty officer sunday defied the illegal order of his commanding officer that petty officer 2nd class brashear not be passed in his test dive no matter how well he did and paid the price of a loss of one stripe and a change of assignment it also told the true story how brashear found the third hydrogen bombs lost in the atlantic ocean off the coast of spain in the 1950's and how he saved the life of another seaman who was in the line of the snapped running line that would have snapped him in two if brashear had not shoved him out of the way and took the shot himself this was a complex story that was worth telling and i will admit that two hours and nine minutes was not enough to tell the full story and i can tell from the deleted scenes on the dvd that the crew tried their best to tell a story as full as possible as a professional soldier i was proud to see such a great story told in such a comprehensive manner and to see the traditions and honor of the navy preserved in such a natural and full manner
disappearance is about a couple who take their family on vacation in new mexico and find themselves in deep trouble after taking a detour off the main highway to visit a town that was seemingly abandoned in 1948 for unknown reasons the town of weaver seems harmless at first and has tourist appeal until the family is stranded there overnight and they begin to have good reason to suspect that others have experienced their same predicament with fatal outcomes the henleys watch a blair witch project esquire video diary left by the town's last victim which ironically demonstrates the best performance of anyone in this movie although hamlin and dey's performances are much better than the supporting casts' their emotional affect seems flat to me throughout the movie br br disappearance has appeal for most of the movie as there is much suspense and good direction however the plot takes unexpected and implausible turns that seemingly make no sense worse yet it that there really is no understanding of what exactly is going on in the movie which makes the bizarre ending less tolerable it appeared to me that the movie makers were so focused on making a stream of suspenseful scenes that they threw away all the elements of good story making plot development gradual explanation of themes and symbols that lead to a cohesive solution outcome br br the most difficult aspect of the movie for me was that the first three quarter of it was spent building up tension and curiosity about certain aspects of the plot that were then suddenly disposed of as if we didn't deserve an explanation br br what was the significance of the indian symbols on the walls what happened to the original people of weaver what was the connection with the people at the dinner what did the sheriff know what did the missing boy discover if anything br br this was i believe a bad move since it engendered some resentment i had invested quite a bit of brainpower into hypothesizing some plausible explanations for some of these plot turns and strange events only to have the movie makers simply end it without giving an answer to any of these things these are some nice cliffhangers for the ending of a miniseries that is about to pickup again next week but a totally frustrating and inappropriate ending for a stand alone movie
this film is unusual and bizarre and it is nearly unusual and bizarre in a very good way i give this short a 7 just because it is so unique and off the wall but much of the time it seems as though it is being bizarre just for the sake of being bizarre if the film had managed to integrate its more bizarre moments into some semblance of a plot then it would have been really fantastic br br the main problem here is that it looks as though the creators just jumbled together a bunch of crap about spatulas then threw in a whole bunch more crap that sounded as though it would sound funny coming from the mouth of a spatula br br this is definitely worth checking out but it is not top rate by any stretch of the creators wild imaginations
well not actually this movie is very entertaining though went and saw it with the girlfriend last night and had to use the i think there might be something in my eye routine the movie is a great combination of comedy and typical romance jim carey is superb as a down on his luck reporter who is given the power to change himself and the city in which he resides in fact all the characters are great the movie is not overly funny or sappy good flick to go see with the wife br br all in all 8 10 note i am not an easy grader thats all from bigv over and out
let's start by the simple lines from the viewer's side there a couple of good director details some points of view at the movie scenes that are nice the special effects are good enough a good acting good scenery also but the story is way too simple it shows how a elite army bomb squad unit lives acts and sometimes dies it shows the drama of living in war in my movie experience as a serious action movie addicted guy i missed that click that gets my eyes and mind stuck on the screen one of the things that need to be present in a movie in order to i consider it a good one is the ability of immerse the viewer in the movie reality and time it didn't happened to me i stayed conscious for the entire movie br br honestly speaking i think that this movie gained its place in fame based on the subconscious appeal of american patriotism a healthy and genuine feeling but not the adequate use as a movie fame generator more than a movie about war it grows its popularity based on that br br a simple thought if this was a world war ii or i movie only changing time with everything remained the same would it be this awarded sure not why because there are great ones that elevate the bar way to high br br compared against its rivals in the oscars i don't think that all of the prizes it won are correctly awarded
fact stargate sg 1 is a cheesy sci fi tv series br br there's no escaping facts how much you try to excuse yourself or explain it stargate sg 1 remains a cheesy sci fi tv series br br stargate sg 1 does borrow and steal ideas briskly special fx aren't nearly as impressive as they could have been and the action isn't going to blow you out of the chair or couch for that matter either br br but and this is where i really think stargate sg 1 deserves all the credit it can get for each and every episode or stolen idea i think you can count at least one cheesy sci fi movie that's actually worse than a one hour tv episode br br in fact some episodes actually could probably have been 90 minutes long and still have been better than most movies br br and being able to keep that quality throughout the show and keep delivering and pushing the storyline further is what makes stargate sg 1 special br br i am very picky with my selections i follow perhaps one or two tv series at most and i hold pretty high standards which made me even more surprised when i found myself caught br br so for those who decide to brush of stargate sg 1 as yet another tacky sci fi show don't stick with it and you'll see what i'm talking about
it took us a couple of episodes to get into dark angel as a story and a series since we were transitioning from the sopranos a very different mentality framework but once we got with the gist of the series we were very quickly hooked it's a shame that the series ended just when it was just starting to past good into the excellent category dark angelwas much more than your average tv series it kicks ass and rocks as far as action goes but the interactions of the characters and societal reactions to mutants reminds us of the constant prejudices that we face and make everyday that the story is set in the future keeps the mood surreal and prevents the anti discrimination message from being rubbed in our faces hence not ruining the fun for those who don't like to be lectured during entertainment but every event and human societal interaction remains relevant to the present we all make judgments face our own prejudices but in the end the question of who you are lies in do you sit back and shut your mind to it or do you get up and do something about it for those who have no choice but to fight for survival or justice this series empowers them for those who've never had to face the question this series sneaks in that message under the guise of pure action entertainment it is much more well made and well written than most tv series i'm highly disappointed it ended before it could really kick into high gear
i saw this film under the title of tied up in general i have enjoyed dolph's movies so gave this one a try it wasn't worth it i have read some of the previous comments about the box enticing viewers don't be fooled this is a poor film at best the acting is nonexistent the plot what little there is of one is very predictable the movie in places seems to be chopped together this one just plain stinks the place up not even worth the price of a cheap night rental as a bit of a dolph fan i kept waiting to see him in action by the end of the movie you will still be waiting best to avoid this film and spend your time watching almost anything else
pierce brosnan has sipped his last martini and returns in an outrageous self parody as the aging foul mouthed boozy assassin julian noble who has a particular fondness for teenage girls bullfights and tacky clothes during a job in mexico city he meets danny greg kinnear a straight faced denver suburban business man who's in town to make his deal of a life time in a hotel bar despite their completely different personalities and julian's crude and insensible remarks they become friends br br largely carried by the performances of pierce brosnan and greg kinnear director richard shepard revealed that he didn't write the film with pierce brosnan in mind but i can hardly imagine this without him he proves to have a real talent for comedy and can be more than just james bond or cold war spies the scene in which the two meet at a glossy hotel bar stunning sets and beautifully photographed really is a bravura piece of acting skills the scene lasts almost fifteen minutes and although it was probably carefully scripted the two actors are largely improvising but they succeed wonderfully it almost feels like a new standard in screen acting think of robert de niro and harvey keitel in mean steets improvising and add one of the most subtle underpinnings of many genre clichés and the actors' own typecasting brosnan's james bond in particular and you got one of the most delightful pairings in recent hollywood br br sadly the story wears thin after a while after an hour the film just runs out of steam nevertheless and i can't put my finger on it exactly i did enjoy this very much it just feels very fresh and original with some imaginative use of sets and lighting and some hints to seijun suzuki and jean pierre melville the other characters aren't given much to do but this film does offer something new in that respect it almost effortlessly succeeds in blending all conventional genres into quite an entertaining spoof very amusing br br camera obscura 7 10
i was so surprised when i saw this film so much underrated i understand why some of you dislike this movie its pace is slow a characteristic of japanese films nevertheless if you are absorbed in the film like me you will find this not a problem at all br br i must say this is the best comedy i have ever seen shall we dansu is often considered a masterpiece of japanese comedies it is very different from hollywood ones e g austin powers or scary movies in which a gag is guaranteed in every couple of minutes rather it is light hearted a movie that makes you feel good br br i love the movie because it makes me feel real the plot is straightforward yet pleasing i was so delighted seeing that sugiyama the main role has found the meaning of life in dancing before i watched the film i was slightly depressed due to heavy schoolwork i felt lost however this film made me think of the bright side of life i believed i was in the same boat of sugiyama if he could find himself in his hobby why couldn't i it reminded me of exploring my own future and discovering the happiness in my daily life br br it is important to note that the actors are not professional dancers while some of you may find the dancing scenes not as perfect as you expect i kinda like it as it makes me feel that the characters are really alive learning to dance as the film goes on br br over all this film is encouraging and heart warming as a comedy it does its job perfectly it definitely deserves 10 stars br br and yes aoki is funny d
what a night perry mason then have gun will travel followed by gunsmoke when it was a half hour and finally at 10 30pm came 'sea hunt' with its wonderful opening theme music and mike's boat sailing off to a new adventure terrific regardless of the story it was the lead character played by lloyd bridges strong honest sincere a man's man and a boy's man this brought on an interest in boats that lasted for years why they don't show on cable or make it available on video no idea too bad
i miss dark angel br br i understand not ever one likes it but as far as i'm concerned the show should not have been canceled especially for another space show mock up br br i'm reading the books now they are doing a pretty good job of explaining somethings but i still think we should get a tv movie or something br br the freak nation lives
i loved it so much that i bought the dvd and the novel at the same time the chemistry between the actors including little arthur is amazing and thrilling br br it could have used a bit more screen time for the yummy frederick lawrence played by james purefoy and gilbert markham was amazingly on it from the very start of the movie br br the one who most thrilled me via surprising shock and awe and wonder was rupert graves as arthur huntingdon i adore him in forsyte saga and all else i've seen him in but he outdoes himself here as arthur in my wildest dreams i could not have pictured him playing a demented psycho such as arthur huntingdon but he does and i love it and i love him
i'm glad that users as of this date who liked this movie are now coming forward i don't understand the people who didn't like this movie it seems like they were expecting a serious treatment c'mon how the hell can you take the premise of a killer snowman seriously the filmmakers knew this was a silly premise and they didn't try to deny it the straight faced delivery of scenes actually makes it funny yes there are times where the low budget shows such as that explosion scene but i think an expensive look would have taken away from the fun of the movie so if you like b movies and the goofy premise appeals to you then you'll certainly like jack frost
german filmmaker ulli lommel has managed a task many horror fans thought was impossible he's unseated fellow teuton uwe boll for the crown of director of the worst horror film ever made br br lommel is truly the ed wood of the new millennium this film is as shoddy and laughable as the best worst of ew i am both proud and embarrassed to say that i watched it in toto morbidly fascinated to see just low the bar could be set the answer is subterranean lommel dug a pit and buried it br br the fun begins with the cast of international nobodies only someone who has lived in los angeles where every auto mechanic doctor and mailman is an actor or screenwriter waiting to be discovered could easily understand how lommel managed to find so many wannabe actors willing to spew his ridiculous dialog with a straight face br br the main character a villainous beat cop is played by a german actor with a thick german accent aside from being a serial killer he is also the oldest beat cop in la despite the fact that he stops innocent women drivers and takes them into custody then drags them into his home which inexplicably is the top floor of a furniture warehouse and does all this in plain sight of his rookie partners the lapd refuses to investigate going so far as to physically attack one of his accusers in a ninja style raid on his apartment br br the sets are excruciatingly bad the production designer's budget apparently included just enough money for a can of paint enough to paint precinct 707 on a cardboard wall br br since the actors were obviously unpaid non professionals a sad assortment of european emigres possibly deportees if they acted in their native lands bimbos mimbos and desperate middle aged women and since little if any money was spent on sets special efx locations or other production value it is only fair to mention that they did spring for a few genuine looking police uniforms sadly they couldn't afford a police car the uniformed cops cruise the streets in a shiny new mercury rental br br more than half of the story focuses on the dirty deeds of our deranged german lapd officer and the futile efforts of two young rookies to stop him one of these young actors is especially pitiable because he's the only actor in this whole mess with even a vague shot at a real career in the movies the other fits right in with a rockabilly hairdo and tortured brando posing that needs to be seen to be appreciated br br the latter part of the film is where the title gets its zombie as the victims of our killer are resurrected after he murders a girl who had just visited some voodoo priestesses to have a protective spell put on her don't ask why a girl from romania would resort to voodooism in anticipation of being murdered just accept lommel's logic and enjoy the absurd ride br br after much prolonged hand clawing out of straw covered roadside graves the zombie girls manage to make their appearance they look exactly as they did before death maybe even prettier with black glamor make up generously airbrushed around their eyes looking nothing like zombies they look more like high fashion models ready for the runway br br at this point in the movie lommel borrows a creative note from his lauded countryman boll and injects large doses of cheesy euro trash techno into the soundtrack we're talking prehistoric electronic bumblebee noise stuff they might have played in an ibiza disco when lommel was still young enough to shake his booty br br unlike other zombies lommel's girls speak and function as normal er i mean as they did before becoming zombified this gives our auteur ample opportunities to shower us with more of his golden dialog yes a golden shower it is br br i won't spoil anything by revealing the shock ending all i can say is it's perfectly in tune with the rest of this masterpiece the spirit of ed wood lives on or should i say his geist

with the death of george nader on 4 february 2002 i thought of this most interesting program which even though it had only a short run was a tremendous idea with good story lines throughout generally unseen for over 40 years it would be worth viewing again the opening credits showed many differing images one of which was a snippit of colonel john paul stapp riding his famed rocket sled at the point where he was often referred to as the fastest man alive
excellent plot within a plot within a plot shame about two of my film heroes having a good snog must be my upbringing br br very well acted by all you never quite know who's going to out do who the last little twist at the end allows for all to get their just deserts br br recommend to all a harmless tongue in cheek thriller which if it has any faults is probably michael caine's over use of the word bloody but that's his signature isn't it br br 9 10
come on they did that on purpose two of my current faves on tv meloni from oz and l and o svu and janel from west wing hook up for a nice little sleeper character study plot's nothing fancy but the acting is right on the mark tim busfield shows up for some neat bits worth a look
there is a scene in this film at about the 42 minute mark that is among the worst i have seen in some time as f scott fitzgerald gregory peck and sheilah graham deborah kerr are lounging on the beach suddenly things become tense and sheilah begins to cry at which point she tells her lover about her sordid past this dramatic scene becomes so terribly overdone and histrionic i couldn't help but turn to my wife and exclaim how stupid it all was as dramatic music swelled on the television as it all came to a phony crescendo no one experiences moments like this no one now how much of the rest of the film is true i cannot say but this particular moment was laughably bad and as fake as an 8 rolex and leads me to assume that some of the other reviewers were correct the film is a lot of bunk however i am not an expert on the life of these two people and the internet didn't seem to clear this up either br br just who were f scott fitzgerald and sheilah graham and what was their relationship really like what i do know about fitzgerald however does seem different from what i saw in the film was he the suave and decent man we initially see in the film well considering he was married at the same time he was carrying on with graham and drank like a fish i'd assume he wasn't was he as obnoxious and boorish as we later see in the film perhaps but if he was this bad and yet ms graham stayed with him then this makes her out to be a complete dummy and not someone you'd like to see featured in a film and if he wasn't then the film does a poor disservice to his memory either way it made for a painful and not particularly pleasant viewing experience br br the sum total of this film appears to be a tale of two not particularly likable or healthy people in a dark and salacious way some might find this all very entertaining but most are sure to see this as a train wreck with no surprises along the way unpleasant but with glossy production values especially the music which was lovely but way over the top it begs the question why did they even choose to make this in the first place the bottom line it's a pretty bad film all around and probably not worth your time even if like me you are big gregory peck fan
i originally gave this episode a rating of two i now wish i'd thought more about it i also wish they had negative rating options br br watching it i was amazed at how poor the whole thing was from start to finish i adore ron pearlman and john carpenter so what went wrong last season episode 13 was pulled due to the way it handled the abortion issue i think that this season mr carpenter managed to make something so grey area that you can't immediately see if he is pro choice or anti abortion it was only after i sat and thought about it that i realized he is very much anti abortion you get this most clearly in the end when the 'mother' shoots the baby and kills it to the dismay of the 'father' who walks off in grief leaving the mother unharmed but you also see it in the way the ron p character is treated i hardly think that if someone has proved themselves enough of a threat in the past so as to have a restraining order against him that they would not immediately be ringing the police instead we have the guard almost sympathetically dealing with him only to pay for it in the end i don't mind someone having a strong view on something even if it isn't something i agree in but i do think its a bit lame not to stand by that view rather than trying to look like they're sitting somewhere in the middle br br but political issues aside this episode was beyond poor the music was retro 70's and just plain didn't work the acting other than ron p was poor the effects were dreadful it might have been better just to not show the monster at all rather than show the lame excuse for a monster they had br br all this being said i'm glad they have the masters of horror i don't mind sitting through some really poor episodes to find the good ones its a bit like renting horror movies from the video store every now and again you get a good one and it makes it all worth while i do agree with the poster that said maybe the name needs to change from masters some of these people just plain don't deserve the title let me stress tho even tho i hated this episode john carpenter totally deserves the title he is a master thru and thru
to begin with i loved göta kanal 1 it had a lot of classic jokes including that unlucky guy in the canoe who always seems to be at the wrong place at the wrong time he is still acting the same guy in the göta kanal 2 movie but in my opinion hes performance is not as funny as it was in the first movie in fact you don't notice him much at all a thing that made me think bad about this movie is the choice of boats in this movie there are only race boats they sure is speedy but those do not make waves like the big floating mansions used in the first movie i liked the old ones better and these new boats makes one of the last scenes look ridiculous when the man in the canoe suddenly jumps out of it to evade the big waves from those small speedy boats truly a minus you have to accept that we're not living in the same sweden as in 1974 anymore this movie also contains a bit more violence than the first one although the movie was great all in all i've just concentrated on some cons that i was disappointed in but the rest of the movie were up to my expectations so go see it it's worth the money
i actually like asylum movies i've made it a habit to see as many as possible even the rip offs they've done have been cool like exorcism and when a killer calls this is just plain lame i can't believe that the same people who made dead men walking and dracula's curse actually made this movie too it's not even laughably bad like jolly roger or alien abduction which by the way are pretty bad this is just bad i mean i can appreciate and or forgive bad acting or lame special effects in an asylum movie but this film takes itself way too seriously i really hope that snakes on a train is better now that's a movie i can't wait to see
i'm kinda torn on dark angel the film appears to be a loving tribute to the greatest pin up to ever live but there is so little actual content that the film itself is virtually pointless i can't really see what the motivation or point of this film is as there is very little biographical information provided in the narrative so those who don't know much about bettie aren't gonna know much more after watching dark angel either br br the film basically chronicles the last few years of bettie's career in bondage modeling almost the entire film is comprised of re enactments of some of bettie's more famous photo shoots and loops these re enactments take up literally 75 of the films run time and give virtually no insight into bettie as a person the film touches briefly on her short lived legitimate acting pursuits and her subsequent decision to leave the business and become religious but all of this is pretty much glossed over in favor of showing long and drawn out re enactment scenes br br dark angel isn't a horrible film there's just no substance to it the other problem is that the actress that plays bettie only really resembles her in farther away shots up close it's a no go the other thing that irritated me is that although bettie did several topless modeling shoots the only nudity in the film was a short segment shot in a zoo during the end credits the film itself is obviously extremely low budget but does what it can set and costume wise within it's limitations so no gripes from me there the acting is pretty wooden and unmemorable from everyone involved in fact the most memorable thing about the whole film for me was noticing during the end credits that the actor who played irving klaw's real name is dukey flyswatter no joke check the cast list can't say that i recommend this one too highly unless you are a true bettiefile completist and must own anything relating to her and if you are that bad off then you need to seek treatment anyway 4 10
truly this is a 'heart warming' film it won the george peobody award winning over roots so that may tell you something of the essence of this film i am looking on the internet how to order this movie since my former father in law eugene logan the co writer of this film has been deceased for a few years now so i no longer have the opportunity to receive information from him i would love to have his only grand daughters my daughters see this film as well as to pass this wonderful story on to his great grandsons my oldest daughter was seven years old at the time it was aired on television and i since have been looking forward to seeing it again one of my friends said it was her favorite movie i won't 'spoil' this movie for you
this first installment of crispin glover's personal magnum opus asks you to think a little and so can't be recommended for any viewer who doesn't want to sit and puzzle over glover's imagery or follow the surprisingly simplebut weirdly obfuscatedthread of his narrative to the more casual viewer yes it's probably going to come off as a confusing mish mash of odd startling and disturbing imagery for imagery's sake br br you get the sense that glover doesn't mind that this is the case and he'll almost as gladly listen to why someone hated the film as to why they enjoyed it glover's innate eagerness for and about his work and how audiences interpret it is strongly communicated not only through the film itself but also through the unusual question and answer sessions that he frequently conducts following showings he clearly hopes that people will continue to think about what he has presented br br the easiest way to interpret and dismiss the film is to label it as dada or nihilist a juvenile attack on the modern movie industry from an actor who's worked both without and within but there's a reason why glover performs his slideshow before showing his movie and it's not only to sell books his books juxtapose and create a narrative from images and text that glover pieced together and what is it does similarly with imagery drawn from western culture br br what is it is an endearing and compelling film in ways one hardly expects while viewing much has already been made about glover's use of actors with down's syndrome and indeed that is one of the most initially striking aspects of the film so jarring in fact that many seem to interpret it as some sort of far reaching crusade to see a more realistic and or dignified portrayal of the disabled in movies and televisionor on the absolute other end of the spectrum as a kind of direct exploitation of the disabled but it's not either and maybe that's part of what makes this film so uncomfortable for many the underlying agenda is not a political one or one of hatred but one of looking beyond the mainstream culture into a kind of outsider ugliness it's not a film about down's syndrome but it is a film that is owned by the actors with down's syndrome who appear in it br br i'm the sort of person who is entirely gung ho when it comes to ugliness and strangeness being portrayed so starkly that it is beautiful happily for me this is pretty much exactly how what is it presents itself to viewers glover uses the strange images of snails death and the disabled in part because he wants his audience to feel discomfort at either the sheer oddness of the imagery or the visceral reaction one has to the dying screams of an anthropomorphized snail in some ways the weirdly compelling and occasionally downright grotesque elements of what is it remind me of the work of the painter francis bacon he of the infamous popes yes and the odd distortions of the human figure that inevitably make viewers cringe and want to look away like bacon's paintings glover's film manages to be opulent and humble grainy and polished chaotic and well realized and the contradictions help to make it all the more disconcerting but still this is not an entirely serious film and it largely manages to sidestep the greatest pitfalls of pretension through the use of humor that for the most part derives from the use and juxtaposition of familiar items images and names of popular culture and when what is it is funny it is very funny br br overall what is it is an impressive first film from glover as a director and writer and his presence as an actor in the film proves not to be nearly the distraction one might expect it to be watching it is like being an observer in the kind of dream that isn't exactly good or bad but just strange and that leaves you feeling slightly grimy when you wake up if that's the kind of art you enjoy what is it is likely to exceed your expectations and be well worth the effort of catching it in the theatre along with the big slide show and glover himself all in all it's an experience you're unlikely to forget any time soon
i'm not a fan of the left behind book series the books are written at a 6th grade reading level with a lack of research and understanding of science technology and politics while the books do manage to remain faithful to scripture their methods of fulfilling prophecy are often ridiculous an example is their explanation for the russian arab invasion of israel also the books have an unmistakable preachy tone that will turn off unbelievers rather than bring them to the gospel still i found myself reading these books because of my interest in the events of revelation for a similar reason i watched this film adaptation i am sad to say that it is a rather mediocre film bordering on poor the acting is actually rather decent for the most part with occasional bits of poor acting and over acting the script is rather bad though it is hardly unexpected when starting with the novel as a basis the characters are poorly drawn and underdeveloped events feel scattered and disconnected the dialogue sometimes sounds rushed at least the book managed to flesh out its hokey conspiracy theory here the viewer is left with an incoherent mess that only makes much sense if one has read the book the pacing of the film is also very poorly executed with the opening and conclusion seeming extremely rushed and the middle dragging to an excruciatingly slow trudge that makes it feel padded the music is schizophrenic at times it successfully underscores the mood and sounds fitting for a motion picture at other moments it reminds me of sitcom and mini series music and still other bits remind me of a poppy mtv soundtrack that just doesn't belong in the film i can give the film points for the scene of panic on board the plane but that's it the other scenes involving the disasters after the rapture are far from compelling the film also suffers from the book's preachiness although its message isn't quite as in your face in all i found the movie just as disappointing as the series this is not the film to rally christians around it i hope that this film does not get any attention at the theaters next year it would be more unnecessary bad publicity for christianity for an example of a compelling intelligent well researched series based on revelation that presents a realistic and christian world view without offending the secular reader who after all should be whom a christian is trying to reach read the christ clone trilogy by james beauseigneur it's a great read and is a much better choice for unbelievers or believers who appreciate quality
i don't know how this movie received so many positive reviews on this site i'm a big vonnegut fan and am very familiar with the story this showtime original film bastardized beyond belief but even if i wasn't the poor acting very poor casting sean astin as the brilliant athletic and all around individual harrison the guy's completely generic and sub standard writing rendered this tripe barely watchable someone pointed out how cute that maculay culkin line was if you read that and thought that was pure comic brilliance sadly it probably was the most intentionally funny part of the movie maybe you'll like this movie but if you're a vonnegut fan or not completely insane don't see it please
the thief of bagdad is impressive in the shape of the evil magician jaffar conrad veidt he plots with lies and magic spells to obtain the kingdom from its rightful ruler the young king ahmad and a gorgeous princess from her father br br he falls victim in the end as all tyrants do in books and legends to love and of the common man whom he ignored here embodied by the little thief sabu br br the armies of good and evil black and white are superbly realized in both visual and literary terms br br the script is poetic simply and very beautiful the costumes of the magician and his men rising and falling like the wings of black birds attacking suddenly in the night to inflict destruction and create terror br br the radiant hero wears white turbans and robes and his princess is dressed in pinks and pale blues br br for spectacular scenes it matched all that had gone before while through its use of color it brought to life a world such as had not seemed possible before br br with flying carpet and flying white horse with a giant genie excellently played by rex ingram with evil wizards and with the good acting of sabu and veidt the thief of bagdad captures the quality and true atmosphere of the arabian nights br br the 1940 version remains the screen's finest fairy tale
an archaeologist casper van dien stumbles accidentally upon an ancient 40 foot mummy well preserved underground in the nevada desert they are determined to keep this a secret and call in a jewish translator to assist in figuring out the history of it the mummy as explained at the beginning is the son of a fallen angel and is one of several giants that apparently existed in those days in order to save his son from a devastating flood which was predicted to kill everything he mummifies his son burying him with several servants for centuries planning to awaken him years from then in our present the fallen angels still walk the earth and the mummy is resurrected and a ritual is expected to take place most of the movie is slow having to do with a lot of biblical crap and a couple lousy air punching fights the mummy is decent looking but isn't shown nearly enough it should have had more to do with that but it dragged on a great deal so eh don't bother
star rating the works just misses the mark that little bit in between lagging behind the pits br br mike atherton dudikoff is peacefully making his way in the wild west when he spots a group of men mistreating a lady being a gentleman he naturally steps in and puts a stop to this and in doing so kills the son of a nasty enforcer this is just the beginning of a all guns blazing battle to the finish from which there will be only one winner br br m dudikoff is an action star who's never truly managed to take off with me maybe i discovered him too late and after the other film i saw with him in it last monday the human shield it was just another dud ha ha added to the list but i have a thing for westerns being films that just sort of transport me to a different time and place and provide real escapist entertainment and with this dudikoff has picked one of his better scripts as his films go anyway br br the film hits a few low points in the shape of a naff central villain sounding like a blank marlon brando and some generally ropey acting from some of the cast along with the obligatory cheap looking sets but if for some strange reason your life ever depended on watching a dudikoff film this would be one of your best choices
the fact that i did not like the music is a very personal opinion the historical innacuracies are not i do realize that it is an opera and not a documentary but some important aspects are missing especiallly if other people comment falsely because of it br br abbu abas was the mastermind of this operation which was staged and reorganized due to discovery on board the shiph in order to free 50 terrorists from israeli prisons one of which was samir kuntar a heinous terrorist whose story you can find by searching for klinghoffer samir kuntar on google abbu abbas was responsible for many other terrorist operations even if he never set foot on the achile lauro ben laden never set foot on the planes that hit the wtc did he br br possible spoilers br br the movie almost excuses the terrorists' actions and reactions because of horrors they might have lived always accentuating and exaggerating how much the israeli's have done to hurt them however they never portray the hurt that the palestinians have ever caused to the israelis the movie uses quite horrid images from the sabra and chatila horror and nothing is said understating the general belief that it was israel who was responsible without ever mentioning that it was a syrian les lebanese army who conducted the massacre br br the acting was generally very bad but i guess that's what can be expected from opera singers br br on another note i am shocked at how a person can excuse terrorists killing a hostage because the hostage tried to stir the 400 innocent hostages against the armed terrorists and add that the person should not be considered sympathetic because he is a supporter of zionism imagine how unsympathetic his wife was spitting on the terrorists who shot her husband and threw his body into the sea i hope no one in the world is as cruel as she is wink wink
aileen gonsalves my girlfriend is in this film playing a secretary at the main character's bank she has a lovely scene with roshan seth in a restaurant there's more information on her website at having stated my personal interest in the film i have to say that i think it is a beautiful movie moving funny and beautifully filmed
why was this film made even keeping in mind the generous tax concessions that australian film investors were given there can be no reasonable explanation for this film being given the go ahead for goodness sakes the actors cast in this film are aussie b grade celebs not actors people like john michael 'hollywood' howson the original drummer from the band in hey hey its saturday and the voice over guy in countdown but in saying that this is still very watchable as long as you give it the brain attention it deserves none the script is bad even for a self confessed b grade horror and the acting and film quality is worse it often looks as though it is a home movie but even a home movie has 'realism' anyone interested in australian cinema please for the love of god pretend this film was never made
another trashy grade z quickie from the prolific albert pyun tim thomerson´s 13 inch clint eastwood like cop from outer space chases an ugly flying head to earth and gets involved in a gang war in south bronx mercifully short but deadeningly dull with the cheesiest effects since attack of the 50ft woman they should have fired the continuity guy too note how thomerson´s sunglasses disappears and reappears in every second shot laughably bad but that´s why we watch these movies ain´t it sequel ´dollman vs demonic toys´ is reportedly even worse if that´s possible br br 0 of br br
if you are a crispin glover fan you must see this if you are a sean penn fan you must see this if you are a movie fan in general you must see this if you have no idea who crispin glover is and you have no idea who sean penn is this film will probably still have a lot of value but the more work you've previously seen by crispin or sean the better br br this movie is so funny but it is also pure genius there is nothing that i know of that resembles this film it is its own genre i doubt that anything like it will ever be made again i cannot say anything more about exactly why without partially spoiling it and some of the other reviews here have already done a good job at doing that br br in response to any of the reviewers here that gave it a bad review i ask that you view the film again in reality there is no point at which this film could fairly be called boring this is possibly the funniest most entertaining and least boring film ever made and it only gets better with age and repeated viewings a timeless classic that unfortunately very few will be able to claim to have seen br br beaver trilogy is the brilliant work of director trent harris also responsible for the amazing rubin and ed which crispin glover also stars in br br unfortunately copies of this film are rare and hard to find i managed to find a vhs version after some diligent searching though and there are a couple of ways to find it that i know of but i really wish someone would put this onto a dvd
what a thrill ride twisted and thought provoking once again sharon stone pulls off her drop dead gorgeous spellbinding character of author catherine tramell impeccably the original basic instinct takes place in san francisco the sequel takes place in london where catherine has now relocated both bustling cities known for excitement haute couture and a perfect place for someone like catherine trammel to take residency david morrisey derailed plays the smooth role of psychiatrist dr michael glass the character david thewlis plays as roy washburn with scotland yard is a refreshing departure from his role as lupin in the harry potter series flashy cars designer clothes sex drama humor tension all of the basic instincts mind bending throughout great screenplay from the climactic opening scene to the surprise ending this film is anything but boring everyone in the theater was glued to the screen
was the script more fitting for a 30 minute sitcom yes but they still make it work i thought the actors did a fantastic job with an otherwise bland script especially jack black and christopher walken most people on the board seem to really hate this film i personally can't see how that could be but envy is just one of those film that you either love it or hate it much like napoleon dynamite and every leslie neilsen movie ever made you either think it's one of the worst movies ever made or one of the funniest don't avoid this movie because of the reviews watch it and see if you're one of the ones who really like it if you do i guarantee it's worth your money if you don't like it well now you know
oh cgi a blessing when used properly a sin with it's used by people who have no idea what their doing sadly that's not the only thing that's used poorly in this umpteen jaws rip off br br ok anybody who has read any number of my posted reviews has probably noticed 2 things 1 i like low budget horror movies and 2 if there is a cute guy in said low budget movie i'll usually point them out so let's just get this out of the way right now this is one low budget horror movie i didn't like the acting for the most part is horrible effects laughable and the script rivals battlefield earth as the worst i've witnessed this year as far as the resident cute boy dax miller bog wins that prize hands down this boy is hot and surprisingly he's not just a toned body with nice eyes and a cute butt he can actually act well as much as he can in this odious film now that we have the housekeeping chores out of the way let's get on with it br br in cliff notes version here's the story don't worry i'll try not to give anything away br br a film crew travels to a remote island to film a documentary about two surfers established cute boy and his buddy who surf with sharks unknown to them is a rather large salt water crocodile lurking around the island croc shows up mayhem ensues and people are eaten roll end credits br br as i said earlier this film pretty much blows it started pretty well but soon devolved into being silly and stupid a main character becomes lunch in a rather humorous way and our remaining heros utter one liners at the victims expense also if this croc is at the top of the food chain on both the land and in the water what's with all the sharks around if this thing can eat a 40 foot boat i don't think a few skimpy sharks would stick around the fx is some of the worst i have ever had the displeasure to see the cgi is horrendous and they've even managed to screw up the animatronic crocs attention filmmakers national geographic discovery store the croc hunter they know what crocodiles look like you obviously didn't reference any of these judging by the monstrosity seen towards the end of the film and what's with the pirate drug pusher gang did you just need another reason to rip off a woman's top br br it's funny how we get little sub genres in the movie world with alligator and it's sequels lake placid crocodile and now blood surf it now looks like over sized crocodile alligator movies should now get their own category at blockbuster alligator was good lake placid was good i even thought tobe hooper's crocodile was good blood surf sucked br br my grade d
one used to say concerning nathaniel hawthorne that his failures were more interesting than his successes i believe that the same remark could suit to mcdonald eddy's pictures and especially this one br br it apparently possesses many characteristics of a failed movie it's kitsch the script because of censorship sounds inconsistent yet this movie gets also some good points good rodgers hart's music i married an angel tira tira tira la good acting with e e horton and reginald owen br br anyway if you may dislike it you can't forget it this strange movie actually leaves a very strong dreamlike impression and you are very likely to keep it in mind for days maybe for weeks why in the thirties and the beginning of the forties movies didn't have the same mean than today it aimed like a dream to divert the public in order to make it forget a difficult reality of all the the dream movies that was made in that time this one stands as particularly powerful br br in short let's say that the better way to appreciate this movie is to watch it without wondering whether it's good or bad to watch it like you would watch a dream
when i saw this movie i was stunned by what a great movie it was this is the only movie i think i would ever give a 10 star rating i am sure this movie will always be in my top 5 br br the acting is superb leonardo dicaprio and kate winslett are at their best i don't think anyone could have a better job than kate br br if it is a rainy day and you can't decide what to rent well this is the one you will love all the acting special effects and much much more br br if you have not seen this movie go rent or buy it now you won't regret it br br
i am a big fan of the original book and this adaption is simply bad first of all it had trouble deciding if it is a kiddie toon or an adult one that caused a strange mix of an adult story and some pretty violent scenes with a silly little duck that keeps giving funny moments in the beginning br br but that's hardly important the film is simply boring unmoving and not true to the original story it simply fails to transfer to the picture all the points orwell tried to make to his book br br spoiler br br second revolution haven't they guys learned anything who be the next napoleon then benjamin
this film breeches the fine line between satire and silliness while a bridge system that has no rules may promote marital harmony it certainly can't promote winning bridge so the satire didn't work for me but there were some items i found enjoyable anyway especially with the big bridge match between paul lukas and ferdinand gottschalk near the end of the film it is treated like very much like a championship boxing match not only is the arena for the contest roped off in a square area like a boxing ring there is a referee hovering between the contestants and radio broadcaster roscoe karns delivers nonstop chatter on the happenings at one point he even enumerates one two three four as though a bid of four diamonds was a knockdown event and people were glued to their radios for it all a common event for championship boxing matches that spoof worked very well indeed br br unfortunately few of the actors provide the comedy needed to sustain the intended satire paul lukas doesn't have much of a flair for comedy and is miscast lovely loretta young and the usual comic frank mchugh weren't given good enough lines glenda farrell has a nice comic turn as a forgetful blonde at the start of the film but she practically disappears thereafter what a waste of talent
it's somewhat telling that most of the great reviews for the film on imdb all come from people who have only reviewed one film in their entire imdb career and yes you've guessed it that film is parasomnia i've often suspected suspiciously good reviews on imdb for what turns out to be an anything but good films as underhand marketing but it seems fairly transparent in this case br br that's not to say parasomnia is terrible but it stops well short of being the good or great film it had the potential to be br br on the plus side it has a great baddie in patrick kilpatrick who does a brilliant job projecting menacing and evil i could easily see him having what it takes to play a truly memorable baddie on a par with hannibal lecter there are some beautiful visuals in the dream sequences in fact if the film had decided to explore that terrain more it might have been something better the actual concept of devious misuse of hypnosis is great too br br although i understand suspension of disbelief is necessary for immersion in any good story it's the mark of a good story that it succeeds in letting you do that if you find yourself being annoyed at what you find illogical or just plain silly then the story is losing you and that's what kept happening to me with this film other reviewers have mentioned this here and i don't want to get into spoiler territory but i will say the setup at the ending was particularly ludicrous and disappointing not too mention the varying mental age of a character that is only supposed to have experienced a few years of life br br all in all there is the germ of a great idea here in diabolically misused hypnotism but sadly this film fails to realise it into anything special
i watched 'envy' two nights ago on dvd at a friends house the premise of this film is quite promising jack black and ben stiller in a comedy with a lot of potential but it completely fails to deliver i watched it with about five friends and no one laughed for the entire film the jokes which are few and far between are not funny in any way the story line is crap and they never answer the question where does the sh t go of course the answer to that is no one cares this film lacks any sort of comedy value and as a few other users have said the only thing that makes it even almost worth watching is christopher walken as the j man none of the characters are developed the plots so thin it's nearly transparent and is that song throughout the film supposed to be funny
this is loosely based on the ideas of the original 80's hit it's set in the modern day as we see a base in afghanistan get destroyed by a uav right at the start br br and that's exactly where the movie jumps the shark uav's aren't armed they could be but i don't think it's ever been tried for real we get to see the computer that has masterminded this operation called r i p l e y we are introduced to hacker will farmer he's good at chemistry electronics which doesn't make him a computer hacker his love interest annie will's 1st attempt at hacking is not only a complete failure his ip address is also logged and annie guessed who it was we also meet wills mom who works for a chemical company br br wills taking money from his neighbours bank account mr massude isn't a hack he helped him set up the account we then get a nod back to the original movie where they decide against playing global thermonuclear war they play the dead code the trace the ripley office are running is not on will but on massude's pc so all the evidence they were gathering was useless against will br br exactly why ripley shut will's machine down isn't explained he's only playing an online game also why it felt the need to have to shut down all the electricity in the entire block he lived in as well why a counter terrorism agency would see this as a viable target is extremely questionable as for ripley activating his mobile phone i think not it wasn't connected to the pc and the message wouldn't play unless he actually answered the phone so there's more bad hacking science there too br br ripley agents arrive at massude's home take him away will is given a envelope which turns out to contain a lot of money will searching for the licence plate of the car that took massude isn't a hack as you never see him break into the dmv computer the ripley agents who grab dennis in the airport as he's looking for will have no authority to arrest or detain him will's mother hadn't been stealing chemicals bio agents either and even if she did they had no right to arrest or detain dennis patriot act or not br br i don't know why will was worried about being arrested for any crime in canada as its a totally different country with different laws to the us br br the computer has gone rogue and all the action its taken against will his mother dennis wasn't sanctioned by a government agency the phone phreak we see will do is the 1st show of any hacking skill in the movie we also get a hack into ripley which seemed too easy for such a powerful system br br the guy who ran into annie at the airport was also watching them in the street was nothing to do with ripley the laughable notion that ripley could track a cellphone whilst underground was as stupid as the idea that a computer reads lips br br another reference to the original movie when they mention stephen falken as the designer of the system ripley replaced the joshua project we discover that the guy who ran into annie is falken not played by the original actor sadly who faked his own death br br we also get to see wopr as what's going to help them beat ripley and they kept the same voice used back then falken wopr are destroyed too quickly after being hardly used at all the same explosion should kill will annie the russian it's also unlikely they'd create a self contained computer system that has the ability to nuke or drop chemical weapons on the country it operates out of br br the whole decontamination plot idea are totally unbelievable those kinds of orders would have to go through the president or joint chiefs of staff so yet another laughable unbelievable idea br br the ip hacks against ripley aren't done by will he just contacts one of his friends who suggests implements the idea it's excessively laughable that will would get a login just from increasing ripley's operating temperature having joshua as a backdoor into ripley especially after it had been blown to bits is an incredible cop out and screams of a very desperate writer who had no ideas left and wanted to get this movie over and done with br br there is an awful good where ripley is playing dead code and we see a countdown saying 17 minutes then ripley says decontamination in 30 minutes how crap is that when they can't even keep up with their own timer ripley's attack mission against philadelphia is halted far too easily in my opinion and it decides to attack joshua in its internal circuits and reroutes the missile aimed a philly to washington where ripley is stationed the idea of the nuclear exchange to make ripley realise what she's doing won't work surely she'd already know if she had joshua insider her as he'd already learnt this lesson in the original movie is yet another nod back to the original movie br br their cop out at having ripley repeat joshua's exact same words form the end of the original movie just goes to show how many original ideas they were unable to come up with br br if you want to point fingers for bad stolen ideas the men to blame are randall badat rob kerchner this is an awful movie and is best avoided
when i had first heard of solar crisis then got a load of the cast i wondered why i had never heard of a movie with such a big cast before then i saw it br br now i know br br for a movie that encompasses outer space the sun vast deserts and sprawling metropolises this is an awfully cramped and claustrophobic feature it feels like everyone is hunkered close together so the camera won't have to pull too far back br br and the effects while good are pretty underwhelming we're talking about the imminent destruction of the planet earth if a team of scientists and soldiers cannot deflect a deadly solar flare but other than shouting sweating and a red glow about everything there's no real feel of emergency br br don't get me started about the cast what heston palance matheson boyle et al are doing in this movie without even bothering to act with any feel for the material is anyone's guess makes you wonder who else's condos aren't paid for in hollywood br br and as far as the end goes well let's just say it's tense and intriguing but it's too little too late in an effort like this if it had kept up that kind of pace all through the film maybe i would have heard of solar crisis sooner br br two stars mostly for lost opportunities and bad career moves br br i wonder how alan smithee keeps his job doing junk like this
rock 'n' roll high school will probably have to go down in history as the ultimate rebellious party flick portraying a bunch of high school students using the ramones' music as inspiration to rise up against their despotic principal mary woronov of eating raoul fame the whole movie is a mile a minute it's basically a big excuse to have fun and i'm sure that you will bullied freshmen check a dorky music teacher paul bartel also from eating raoul check exploding mice checkmate br br anyway this is the sort of stuff that makes life worth living even for someone like me who doesn't know the ramones' music it's pure pleasure with roger corman executive producing and joe dante co directing how could we expect anything less too bad that director allan arkush later degenerated into fare such as caddyshack ii br br also starring p j soles vincent van patten clint howard dey young dick miller who has appeared in every one of joe dante's movies and many of roger corman's don steele and of course the ramones a real treat br br it seems like bartel and woronov always co starred they also co starred in joe dante's hollywood boulevard and the slasher flick chopping mall also starring dick miller in which they reprised their roles from eating raoul
more than just a kids' movie holes looks at how past incidents still affect us today whether we know about them or not when teenager stanley yelnats iii shia leboeuf gets sent to a prison camp where he is forced to dig all day long he discovers a number of things about the camp and his personal connection to it through flashbacks we learn that a number of things are closer than we realize you'll understand this better when you see the movie leboeuf does a pretty good job as do the other cast members sigourney weaver jon voight tim blake nelson henry winkler patricia arquette and eartha kitt a very interesting movie
to all the haters out there condemning a tv series with one episode is like judging an entire book after reading the first few pages that being said i was a huge fan of bsg thought it was some of the best tv drama not just sci fi on the air but it was time for it to end and the story to move on i liked the bsg epilogue the plan but it raised as many new questions as it answered so i eagerly anticipated caprica and i was not disappointed br br i was hoping it would not try to be another bsg and i was pleased that caprica is something different and i personally found the story exciting in a different way than blazing space battles explosions and sci fi special effects don't get me wrong i like that stuff too eric stolz and esai morales give solid performances and alessandra was just wonderful i can't wait until next week
how is it possible that no journalist or critic reminded us of the resemblance with that other better flemish movie congo express 1986 there are also some characters in congo express put together without having really a relation to each other jean de congolees the workman the two taxi drivers the street singer roger guy lucienne and gilbert of course tom barman is a star and luc gubbels wasn't that should not be a reason to pardon the flaws in the script if there is a script of anyway the wind blows the joke the only one at the party about the ice in the refrigerator is taken from that great flemish movie de witte 1934 where de witte is putting too much salt on the potatoes some accidents happen in the movie but there comes no explanation after tom barman delivers us here a movie that is more like an experiment to watch at the television than a movie for the theatres another missed chance for flemish cinema
i was very interested to see this movie when it first came out in the theaters however i wasn't able to get around to it so finally it hit the shelves and i picked it up not knowing exactly what to expect i plopped the dvd in the player settled in the for an evening of murder and pressed play what followed was one of the more engaging flicks i've seen in the last couple years br br some spoilers br br this is the story of the wonderland murders which led to the seediest parts of la and straight to the biggest porn start of the 70's john holmes val kilmer br br i was hooked from the beginning and the feel of the movie held me all the way until the very bloody end i was surprised to find that the movie focused less on the actual murders and more on the events before and the investigation after aside from a few blood splattered walls in the beginning and the actual showing of the murders towards the end the movie was more or less an engaging show of great dialoge and great acting val kilmer all but sells me as a junkie porn star and even the beautiful but that's it bosworth was a joy to watch and just for her looks mind you br br i personally felt the best aspect of the movie was as i mentioned its lack of outright showing the murders it was shown in a very dark atmosphere so you couldn't completely see the brutal bludgeoning bestowed apon the sleeping foursome furthermore the sound effects of said murders were more than enough to whet my appetite they were being beating with lead pipes there's not much more that needs to be said br br my only real problem was carrie fisher's brief appearence her portrayal of the overly religious figure was i think a bit too cliche of her appearence maybe that person was actually part of the story maybe not but i wasn't sold and for some reason fisher seemed a bit too akward in her portrayal br br overall an excellent movie worth the watch even if once br br 8 10
what a snore fest br br of all the bits of nostalgia that hollywood has decided to remake and update this is by far one of the most pointless this was a totally pointless show in the first place and we really don't need a 'modern' update br br never mind the bigotry and sexism inherent in the system from the beginning so many advances have been made socially since the show ran that the entire point of the show if it ever had one has been lost br br also what is the point of having a character named boss hogg if he's not overweight

this shorter movie is the epitome the expected results when the imbecile runs the asylum it is sad how the futures of these young people were rolled down a craps table when neither saddam hussein nor the people of iraq god rest the souls of the 350 000 plus that have been killed had anything to do with terrorism nor al quida br br following this movie the astute viewer will need to pick up or download a copy of loose change this movie is available free on the internet until the bush cabal locks it down by googling up the very title as indicated in parenthesis br br god save our country this will not be done by following the christo fascists that controlled the halls of congress for over 10 years prior to november 2006

it's pretty bad when the generic movie synopsis has more information than the film itself the paragraph long plot summary written on the movie page has details i could not glean from watching the actual movie i found myself constantly backing it up to see what details i had just missed which could tell me what the bleep was going on alas to no avail this movie leaves out monstrous pieces of the story if you could call it a story it's like they were trying to fool us into thinking that there was some kind of movie here filming just enough so that there was the resemblance of a story and leaving the rest to our imaginations newsflash to the the creators i paid to watch you make a movie i can sit home and imagine plots and story lines for free and rosario dawson this is somebody i've never paid enough attention to to be able to put the name to the face and i can see why she had one of the most artificial performances i have ever seen for a leading character in any movie a or b i figured okay maybe she didn't really want the role just got a hefty offer for a movie she wasn't into wrong she was listed as one of the producers next time you produce something don't book yourself as the lead if you can't act if you really can then create a decent character for you to become also somebody here mentioned the white latino issue yes i hate to say it but this movie does come across as an act of vengeance against white college age males who wear baseball hats that's what happens when there is nothing in the movie to endear the watcher to latino characters the adrian character seems like a cocky jerk who is no better than the story's antagonist as for the maya character she didn't seem like a real person anyway i'm ashamed for hollywood that this movie was even made
excellent view of a mature woman that is going to lose everything even the pruner has a mortgage the way she gets involved into this special business the innocence and the true love that exists between the people of a little town it's mixed perfectly to give us as result a fresh light and funny comedy i couldn't stop laughing with a very funny scene of two old ladies in a drugstore br br i love european films and with movies like this one my opinion grows stronger a movie that i also recommend with my eyes closed in this same genre is waking ned devine br br saving grace a comedy that many friends enjoyed as much as myself you will love it
i hate how this movie has absolutely no creative input i know they're going for realism but to be frank i just don't want realism realism is boring if i want to see daily life i'll uhm live tell me an interesting story and we'll talk i can deal with the low production values hell i'm a sucker for low production values but at least work in some good ideas the direction only goes as far as grabbing a camcorder and walking around a bit but obviously i'm supposed to dig that because it makes stuff so much more realistic hitchcock used to say drama was essentially life with the dull bits cut out i can only conclude this is not drama not by a long shot we get to see rosetta walking to someplace rosetta working in a bakery rosetta eating a waffle rosetta carrying around bags of far rosetta walking back home rosetta walking someplace it's just not that entertaining there isn't really a deeper meaning either i got so bored i started looking for some reflections on life in this movie but it's just plain realism the most overrated quality in the business i guess i'm supposed to love this but come on there's nothing in there
erich rohmer's l'anglaise et le duc makes a perfect companion piece to peter watkins' la commune paris 1871 both films screened at this year's toronto international film festival ironically illustrate how history is shaped to by the tellers of the tale ironic given the tragic events that were taking place in the u s during the festival br br set in paris during the french revolution the movie based on grace elliott's lucy russell memoirs is a first hand account of how she survived those heady but dangerous days she also details her relationship with the duke of orleans played by jean claude dreyfus who in contrast to herself is a supporter of the revolution br br true to form you don't know whose side of history rohmer is going to come down on one of the earliest of the french new wave filmmakers rohmer has often been criticized for being too conservative after all in the midst of the rebelling youth viet nam days of the late 60s and 70s he was filming romantic little confections like claire's knee but don't sell the old boy short folks he's always been a student of human nature not an ideologue and l'anglaise et le duc continues to bear this out br br rohmer's characters are never the bad guys nor the good guys' they are first and foremost human beings who are capable of exhibiting a full range of human potentialities and limitations that's why his movies are always provocative and this film is no exception br br now for the technological nuts and bolts br br rohmer though making his way into his 80s is still on the cutting edge of cinematic innovation the look of l'anglaise is like something you've never seen before you guessed it the old guy like several of the festival's directors this year has gone digital br br all of the movie's exterior scenes look as though they are taking place in their original 1780s parisian settings as a matter of fact you may get so distracted from marveling at the authenticity of the film's look you may have to go back for a second screening to catch the subtleties of the film's psychological and yes i'll say it political insights br br toronto features some of the world's edgiest young filmmakers this year as well as some of the world's oldest and the old masters are standing there on cinema's cutting edges right alongside the young ones br br long live youth long live old age and long live erich rohmer br br
i'd give it a 2 10 br br i was really really disappointed br br the storyline was poorly developed for instance the incidents were too short and brief hence the moral was not clearly brought out i thought brenda song did a fine job but shin koyamada seemed to have a difficult time handling his role i could see the need to put in western elements in the show however there are certain parts where chinese elements were needed too the villain for example his physical appearance resembled a robot instead of something out of the chinese culture the final and the worst flaw were the incorrect and distorted facts placed in the show br br others may point out that this is a 'kid's show' and hence there is no need for the such high standards however there are other disney shows such as mu lan which have been much better in terms of story development and presentation br br in conclusion i feel that disney movies should be better researched and better planned a good show is not enough with just a series of martial arts moves to depend on
this is my favorite jackie chan movie and in an interview jackie said it was his favorite as well it contains some unbelievable stunts and jaw dropping fight sequences as well as some very funny scenes as well this movie was a favorite of brandon lee who used parts in rapid fire and was also lifted in tango and cash which used some of the opening scenes br br jackie plays a policeman in hong kong the story immediately jumps into a fantastic chase through a shanty town and continues as jackie slides down a hill and jumps onto a moving bus to catch the evil ku who is one of the greatest villains in any jackie chan movie you can expect some very funny scenes as jackie tries to balance his duty as a policeman with his girl friend played by maggie chung his job is to protect ku's secretary who has enough information to take him down but even that poses many problems jackie is at his absolute best here the last fight scene at the mall is my favorite fight scene by anyone period it was the most intense fight i have ever seen jackie do and climaxes in a slide down a pole amidst exploding lights all in all one of his greatest stunts he ever did and left him with skin pealed off his hands he was fortunate he was not electrocuted as the person in charge of the stunt used high voltage instead of a lower voltage br br all in all another chan classic and definitely one of his greatest movies by the end of this movie you can tell he held absolutely nothing back and neither did his stuntmen so many of his stuntmen were injured during this movie that nobody would insure them anymore jackie had to take responsibility himself there are no gimmicks wires or stand ins it is all true life action that is a treat to watch it is this type of action that made him the phenomenon that he is and it is a movie that will amaze people 100 years from now if you have not seen this movie and are a fan of jackie chan or action in general give yourself a treat and watch this movie it is truly sensational
this film reminds me of how college students used to protest against the vietnam war as if upon hearing some kids were doing without cheeseburgers in cow dung collehe the president was going to immediately change all us foreign policy br br the worst thing is that while dangerous the concept of a policy based on if the ussr and us went to war it could mean the end of the world worked the us and ussr never went to war br br had we only conventional weapons the notion of yet another war a win able war in europe and asia was not unthinkable br br not that i think they should get rid of this movie it should be seen by film students as a splendid example of how not to make a film br br it should be 0 stars or maybe black holes
i didn't even know this was originally a made for tv movie when i saw it but i guessed it through the running time it has the same washed out colors bland characters and horrible synthesized music that i remember from the 80's plus a 'social platform' that practically screams afterschool special anyhoo br br rona jaffe's thank you mazes and monsters was made in the heyday of dungeons dragons a pen and paper rpg that took the hearts of millions of geeks around america i count myself one of said geeks tho i have never played d d specifically i have dabbled in one of its brethren m m was also made in the heyday of d d's major controversy that it was so engrossing that people could lose touch with reality be worshiping satan without knowing blah blah i suppose it was a legitimate concern at one point if extremely rare but it dates this movie horrendously br br we meet 4 young college students who play the aptly named mazes and monsters to socialize and have a little time away from mundane life except that m m as presented is more boring than their mundane lives none of the allure of gaming is presented here and jay jay's request to take m m into 'the real world' comes out of nowhere it's just an excuse to make one of the characters go crazy out of nowhere also though at that point we don't really care jay jay robbie kate and daniel are supposed to be different but they're all rich waspy prigs who have problems no one really has br br but things just continue getting worse in more ways than one the low budget comes dreadfully clear i love the 'entrance' sign and cardboard cutout to the forbidden caverns robbie pardu shows why he's not a warrior in the oafiest stabbing scene ever and the payoff atop the 'two towers' is unintentionally hilarious tom hanks' blubbering jay jay what am i doing here made me laugh for minutes on end definitely the low point in his career br br don't look at it as a cogent satire just a laughable piece of 80's tv trash and you'll still have a good time that is if you can stay awake the majority is mostly boring but it's all worthwhile for pardu's breakdown at the end at least tom hanks has gotten better not that he could go much worse from here
never viewed this film and enjoyed the singing and dancing by cagney and the other cast members namely dick powell scott blair who had a great tenor voice and ruby keeler bea thorn james cagney plays the role as chester kent who writes musicals and eventually goes into producing prologues which are shown in between the feature films shown in movie theater's during the 1930's chester has trouble with people trying to steal his ideas for his shows this is a very entertaining film with lots of comedy and plenty of laughs joan blondell nan prescott gave a great supporting role who was also very young and pretty dick powell was great as a singer and dancer and just starting out with his long and successful screen career enjoy
this is one of those movies that apparently was trying to ride the martial arts wave craze kind of like billy jack i guess however whereas billy jack did have one notable martial arts scene there are none in this one unless you consider some gentlemanly grappling and roughhousing as such we are introduced to the star who is described as having learned judo in the marines i was in the marines and while they are pretty established in boxing i really don't remember any emphasis on judo as a result the antagonist james macarthur makes reference to the judo when he offers an excuse for why he a state champion wrestler was so easily defeated lame
the film revolves around a man who believes that all forms of media are obsolete the idea behind his art project is to unmask the ridiculous culture that we are bathed in naturally the film takes place in los angeles orange county he attacks stand up comics caw caw caw rock bands models blockbuster hollywood films and touches on many other mediums eventually he finds himself in the sights of the weapon he has set into motion the film is five years old and rings more true every day it's the best description of post punk anger i've ever seen it's also one of my top 10 favorite films
this reminded me soo much of michael winner's crappy 'dirty weekend' with it's awful english low budget feel br br firstly i must say i am a fan of both exploitation and serious film i appreciate say 'demented' for it's ineptitude and 'last house on the left' for it's sheer unashamed brutality and any number of inventive and increasingly brutal italian spin offs br br this was just pointless though kind of like a british budget director thought 'let's remake i spit on your grave without making it too harrowing now that horror is back in fashion with hostel br br the whole thing just doesn't hang together or have a point what's with the rapists's daughter why bother having the man be an expert in security cameras crappy
after just 15 minutes into this film i began to miss zhang yimou's earlier more weighty films that looked at the politics and society of china from unique perspectives his turn to martial arts films was a serious misstep in my humble opinion hero was his worst film since operation cougar with a needlessly complex story and acting more wooden than that found in a john agar film shi mian mai fu is no different as an american who has been studying chinese films for a few years now and understands and can speak some mandarin i'm sure my opinion is different from many others as i'm coming from a different background smmf like hero is not really a traditional a kung fu film and it's certainly not a wuxia pian film there are no sword sorcery or chivalry elements here this is a completely different vehicle than infinitely more watchable films such as a chinese ghost story all 3 the butterfly murders green snake et al while those all featured charismatic leads who looked like they were actually enjoying what they do smmf features bland and sometimes laughable dialogue combined with cardboard acting zhang ziyi plays a blind person about as well as ben affleck there's an air of superiority with this film that's really quite insulting it takes itself so seriously it just becomes a huge joke by the end all the actors look as though this is the most important piece of celluloid in history they destroy any chance of actually conveying emotions and the complete humorlessness of it really makes you wonder if zhang yimou was making a film per se or simply a showcase i e an ego booster for zhang ziyi the camera is literally making out with her face and she gets sexually assaulted not once but twice in the film her acting range really hasn't extended past her ability to play a naive w itch she's so concentrated on her acting she comes across as cold and lifeless as though she's reading her lines from a notecard it's so funny to hear american critics and film people like the completely clueless quentin tarantino call this film a masterpiece i guess if they see a bunch of asian actors on screen looking really important while flying through a bamboo forest they're tricked into thinking it's brilliant film making ching siu tung's choreography while still retaining his trademark style editing and postures lacks the vitality and originality of his earlier films like a chinese ghost story dragon inn and duel to the death sadly to say the wirework in this film is really subpar and if there's subpar obvious wirework then you probably shouldn't have filmed it at high speed the same goes for the special effects which have a distinct b movie feel to them beans daggers bowls arrows swords and other random objects fly through the air after being thrown with no regard for logic turning climbing and banking as though there's a little pilot inside i know that logic doesn't really hold a place in stylized chinese martial arts films but if you don't want to induce a mass amount of giggling from your audience then you should probably work on your compositing a bit more mass melodrama unintentionally funny dramatic moments boring fight scenes really uninspired plot twists are what await you with shi mian mai fu it's obvious that zhang yimou is no longer making movies for chinese audiences this is meant to crack into the western market just as cthd did after watching hero and smmf i've come to the conclusion that if zhang yimou wants to make hollywood films he's definitely off to the right start smmf is basically the phantom menace of chinese martial arts films and i thought hero was bad
stupid stupid stupid i think that angelina jolie is probably one of the most talented actress' today but a movie like this isn't just worth her time she deserves better and so does everyone else in this movie talent is just wasted sorry but i don't feel like writing a review for this br br i give it no stars out of
it was difficult to sit through this horrible heretical adaptation of sherlock holmes apparently matt frewer was cast because he is tall and skinny his skull like face made for a good zombie in the dawn of the dead remake but as sherlock holmes he looks like a scarecrow not only does frewer have a lanky lackadaisical walk that is hard to watch but he looks uncomfortable in the stereotypical holmes overcoats that he is wearing not only that but while the coat is gray twill they apparently could not find a matching cap so his cap is black and it looks shiny as if it were made of polyester whatever the cap was made of it looked very new and artificial jeremy brett occasionally wore those traditional outfits but brett did not have to dress up like sherlock holmes in order to look the part frewer on the other hand is painful to watch even in the full holmes outfit he does not carry himself like sherlock holmes br br frewer's cadaverous face grinning all the time as he spouts on and on in a very bad upper crust british accent is painful to see and listen to to say that frewer is overacting is an understatement after he finishes each sentence with some kind of nasal hum he then sneers as if that were some kind of british trait when i started watching this i thought it might be a comedy featuring wishbone the jack russell terrier i thought frewer had been cast as some kind of foil for wishbone but sadly there is no dog in this movie except for frewer wishbone would have made this movie a lot better br br not only does frewer's version of sherlock holmes never stop talking in that awfully artificial british nasal accent but he is much to friendly and kind frewer is always smiling at the witnesses he talks to and he is so polite and courteous that he could be teaching at a charm school instead of being a sleuth perhaps since this is a hallmark channel production they are trying to make a children's version of sherlock holmes wishbone was better at that too that was kindler and gentler whatever the point of frewer's interpretation of sherlock holmes it is flatter than a pancake and easily the worst version of sherlock holmes that i have ever seen including the previous worst by charlton heston br br overall the tone of this film is awful it reminded me of a typical episode of barnaby jones or murder she wrote or diagnosis murder all the suspects over acted suspiciously and glared at the victims before they were killed holmes and watson are explaining every clue to each other during the entire movie even on murder she wrote there is less exposition br br this sherlock holmes does not even compare very well to jim rockford of the rockford files and it is miles below columbo the awful dialog is probably the fault of the writer it is obvious that who ever wrote this script has very little familiarity with sherlock holmes especially the bbc version with jeremy brett this movie has all of the atmosphere of an episode of little house on the prairie the fact that the actors seem to be smirking when they enunciate their lines in their fake accents does not help br br the only minor bright spot is ken walsh who plays doctor watson with some dignity walsh does not ham it up compared to frewer and when he is often interviewing witnesses his demeanor and conversational style are much more natural and credible unfortunately the rest of the cast is amateurish and the visual clues they give by glaring and making faces at each other to show they are suspicious is something that i had not seen in any modern movie
being a slasher film aficionado i typically will settle in to watch every slash movie that passes over my retinas which sometimes does more harm than good to my brain i will say while channel surfing the other night sleepaway camp ii happened to cross paths with me of course i wanted to check it out as i had heard of the sleepaway camp franchise but have never actually seen any of them for shame i know i will note that since i have not seen the original my criticism should probably not be taken too seriously because perhaps what i think is wrong with it is totally intentional by the franchise's own design br br now i'm assuming that the franchise of sleepaway camp is in itself a joke on itself hell even the name comes off as an intentional joke sleep away camp it's good fun i can appreciate the film for wanting to just put together something for pure camp horror value but that's about as far as i can go the acting in this movie made the cast of the original friday the 13th look like thespians doing a rendition of macbeth campy requires bad acting but come on pamela springsteen as the evil out of touch with reality killer did a better job of killing off my interest than she did killing off the entire cast as far as comedy goes there were a few times where i chuckled but it was few and far between br br ultimately sac ii is pretty boring and i really did want to sleep away the camp the deaths are so obviously staged and fake that you can barely appreciate them if you're looking for a slasher film comedy with good camp i recommend club dread if your channel surfing takes you across this one check and see what else is on
first of all really kim basinger your rich banker husband leaves you alone in your beautiful most likely paid in cash for home and you can't even put on a decent shirt i'm a woman and yes i'm going to come right out say it clean something starting with your hair and while you're at it it's christmas eve buy your kids some presents or at least a christmas tree don't drive 40 minutes to the crowded mall park your car 3 miles away and cry about it the whole walk in and simply buy wrapping paper also the next time you decide to leave someone a nasty note don't sign your name i refuse to feel sorry for della obviously due to the fact that kim basinger is this masterpiece's executive producer she wants you to feel bad for the poor white blond woman we get it alec baldwin is a jerk but seriously don't model horrible films after your own life also you're in you 50s you definitely wouldn't have 8 year old twins and those names terry and tammy way to let your kids grow up with any decent chance of ever respecting themselves it's also pretty fantastic to hear the characters in the film constantly call her beautiful or refer to her as a girl obviously ms basinger had some say about what goes in the script it's also pretty awesome how none of the criminals can fight back apparently della's magical ninja skills are impossible to beat her driving skills are pretty nifty too this film is so cliché it hurts wahhhhh they spelled your name wrong on the tea cup or your husband put a hole in the wall but all you can think about is buying nail polish when you're at the mall instead of maybe some plaster and paint or the woman you went to high school with bought the teddy you were looking at boohooo the fact that she refuses to take off that bright trench coat while running through the woods screaming and breaking everything in her path proves my point this woman is a moron who thinks to grab the toolbox out of the car but not their purse full of identifying artifacts such as your address i have never wanted the bad guys to succeed as much as when i watched this film and did anyone else happen to catch the african american shirt the black guy was sporting oh yes rewind and feast your eyes on perhaps the most racially stereotypical prop in a film yet don't waste and hour and twenty minutes of your life instead go do what della couldn't figure out how to do take care of your kids and maybe brush your hair that powerful ballad at the end though was pretty impressive singing i'll be home for christmas in the rain while your bloody arm clings oh so tightly to your wrapping paper is about as emotional as it gets thanks della
although this seems to be quite an old show 2002 i watched my first ever episode last night and i have to say it has to be the worst show ever br br i am not one for placing comments but i was so shocked that a show could exist that blatantly tries to pander to and i am only assuming that this was their target audience children under 12 years old or people with a less than average iq br br the episode i was subjected to last night contained so many disjointed story lines tried to include every possible plot summary imaginable and all the while trying to preach about friendship family religion and politics br br basic story that they covered in the episode frat house hazing gone wrong wrong with too much alcohol death turns out to be senators son who wants fbi to investigate death is actually murder by peanut allergy senator thinks it could be his sworn enemy and childhood best friend who did this because senator was taking money for his votes for legislation but eventually got a conscience and said 'no' to mean mulit millionaire everybody a suspect but all have the usual alibi ex girlfriend student shagging a married teacher so had to lie disgruntled student who was reported by victim actually had life changing experience senators enemy did not pay desperate student to kill sworn enemies son he gives money freely to lots of broke students all the while the heroine of this dribble has her niece staying who is 'at that age' and has a crush on a boy who she eventually gets the courage to talk to with the assistance of her aunty but only to dump him because the 'in' girls says he is not good enough and so to keep in with them she dumps him don't worry she gets back with boy after she learns the truth about life and the 'in' girls drop her aunty also explains that god is the only one who truly she can rely on i was almost sick at this point br br this 'drama' gets even better when sue and her fbi team find out who the killer is your gonna laugh at this i sure did br br it is one of the frat boys who only a year ago found out he was adopted and that his real dad is an international terrorist and he is trying to impressive real daddy by killing boy and planting bomb at funeral br br the characters are cardboard the acting is cardboard the continuity is cardboard the story is cardboard anybody who says that they love this show has cardboard for a brain br br why the writers of this show have tried to pack in every eventuality into the one show means that they obviously have no faith in the character development or actors capability to carry off a simple plot line watching this show is like watching 'last action hero' with arnie killing 5'000 people with a tooth pick except arnie is a better actor wow never thought there would be a day that i would say that br br in the words of the simpsons beloved character 'comic book guy' br br worst tv show ever
lars von trier is never backward in trying out new techniques some of them are very original while others are best forgotten br br he depicts postwar germany as a nightmarish train journey with so many cities lying in ruins leo kessler a young american of german descent feels obliged to help in their restoration it is not a simple task as he quickly finds out br br his uncle finds him a job as a night conductor on the zentropa railway line his job is to attend to the needs of the passengers when the shoes are polished a chalk mark is made on the soles a terrible argument ensues when a passenger's shoes are not chalked despite the fact they have been polished there are many allusions to the german fanaticism of adherence to such stupid details br br the railway journey is like an allegory representing man's procession through life with all its trials and tribulations in one sequence leo dashes through the back carriages to discover them filled with half starved bodies appearing to have just escaped from auschwitz these images horrible as they are are fleeting as in a dream each with its own terrible impact yet unconnected br br at a station called urmitz leo jumps from the train with a parceled bomb in view of many by standers he connects the bomb to the underside of a carriage he returns to his cabin and makes a connection to a time clock later he jumps from the train at high speed and lies in the cool grass on a river bank looking at the stars above he decides that his job is to build and not destroy subsequently as he sees the train approaching a giant bridge he runs at breakneck speed to board the train and stop the clock if you care to analyse the situation it is a completely impossible task quite ridiculous in fact it could only happen in a dream br br it's strange how one remembers little details such as a row of cups hanging on hooks and rattling away with the swaying of the train br br despite the fact that this film is widely acclaimed i prefer lars von trier's later films breaking the waves and the idiots the bomb scene described above really put me off perhaps i'm a realist
this is one of the best movies i've ever seen it has very good acting by hanks newman and everyone else definitely jude law's best performance the cinematography is excellent the editing is about as good and includes a great original score that really fits in with the mood of the movie the production design is also a factor in what makes this movie special to me it takes a lot to beat godfather but the fantastic cinematography displayed wins this contest definitely a best picture nominee in my book
ascension is actually a step up in terms of what the original movie was in story and in special effects jason scott lee is good as a vampire hunter looking for the count himself if you remember him he was from the movie dragon the bruce lee story ' jason london is funny as luke the kid who helps the woman he loves from a far steal dracula's body from the slab diane neal is good as the woman who steals dracula's body in order to finds a cure for her dying boyfriend and stephen billington is great as dracula himself giving a better performance than gerard butler did the count in the original film roy scheider rounds out the rest of the cast in this movie and he does a decent job as the mentor of jason scott lee's character this is the second sequel in the trilogy and they are off to a good start it's up in the air whether the last film will close the series out on a good note
hello again i have to comment on this wonderful exciting and believable tale of romance and intrigue the music in wonderful and memorable very good colorful movie another movie i liked as well later on was high society with bing crosby wonderful music thanks for listening florence forrester stockton reno nevada
this movie is one of the worst ones of the year the main characters have no chemistry and the acting is horrible paul rudd is the only one that has any talent and the only one that is not annoying i have never watched desparte housewives so i don't know how eva longoria is on that show but in this movie she was horrible it's like she knows nothing about acting all her character does is whine throughout the film and she can't pull off being a b and still be entertaining and the other girl lake bell displays little emotion and it's like you are looking at the cue cards as she reads them br br as for the story it is so cookie cutter it goes from point a to b with little surprise so much more could have been used with kate as a ghost the plot should have revolved more around her and the things she does as a spirit br br final verdict it's not worth watching
ok let me again admit that i haven't seen any other merchant ivory the distributor films nor have i seen more celebrated works by the director so my capacity to discuss before the rains outside of analysis of the film itself is mitigated with that admittance let me begin br br before the rains is a different kind of movie that doesn't know which genre it wants to be at first it pretends to be a romance in most romances the protagonist falls in love with a supporting character is separated from the supporting character and is sometimes united with his or her partner this movie's hero has already won the heart of his lover but cannot be with her his name is henry moores and her name is sajani and they reside in southern india during the waning days of the raj british imperial rule henry has been away from london for a long time and has fallen in love with his married indian maid despite his legal marriage and child overseas what could be better than that they often sneak away for intimate afternoons until some children notice them word spreads to sajani's husband who questions her involvement with moores she denies any contact with him but moores asks her to leave the area sajani refuses because of her devotion to him and commits suicide please take note that these events occur in the opening third of the film the film changes tone and becomes a crime drama in its final portions br br sajani's body is discovered right as moores' family comes to visit the alleged perpetrator is moores's english educated assistant t k t k knows of his master's affair but keeps silent until his life becomes threatened once he is declared innocent he attempts to regain his honor by killing moores t k is too squeamish and leaves him in a dirt path as the rains fall br br i want to warn you this isn't a romance film the dvd cover and theatrical posters show an indian woman and caucasian man embracing in an idealized tropic setting this image is captured directly from the film's opening but quickly disappears then it's over it seems like an effort to capitalize on western fixation on forbidden love it isn't effective at all not only is the movie not a romance but its characters lack any personality they are bundles of walking clichés moores is an arrogant white man who doesn't recognize his indian friend t k 's intelligence t k is torn between his own heritage and his educative background sajani is a woman incapable of having a choice in her romantic life oh and of course moores' family is inquisitive into sajani's death but still slightly racist to indians if the tone wasn't so serious i would be willing to overlook these problems but it isn't the film is presented with a didactic overtone which highlights its poor character development br br no this film isn't terrible other than the laughable screenplay it isn't poor the actors are all experienced and perform well here nandita das who plays sajani was part of wonderful indian drama water even director sivan has an impressive resume he recently oversaw the terrorist which is part of roger ebert's great movies collection what happened here why is this movie so bad well sivan mentioned how he was inspired to direct this film because of a short he viewed in israel called red roofs apparently the story was timeless and sivan sought to create a similar experience set in 1930's india i don't have any problem with that approach but i think sivan may have been too motivated this time the actors cinematography and set design are acceptable but unless you share sivan's aura you'll probably not enjoy it my recommendation is that you presume you aren't in accordance with him and watch something else final consensus and ½ out of
man this was hilarious it should be under comedy or stupid it would have made realizing what a pile of stank this was much easier seriously i want anyone associated with this movie tased effective immediately for everyone who is thinking of watching this movie let''s go over a few plot points oh wait there aren't any there is literally no plot i think casper van dien was bored and he decided to film something with some random someones and miraculously it somehow got on videotape this movie is literally the worst movie of all time don't believe me go watch it do it man i dare you but be prepared to gouge your eyes out if you can sit through this without blowing a cow you are very strong and courageous
i've been disappointed if not surprised at the lack of appreciation this film has received once again billy zane proves he's more than just a hollywood pretty boy in a silent performance that combines spastic slapstick with understated pathos calling this a silent film is inaccurate as there's a lot of music and sound it has a manic pace and is full of the goofy inventiveness that ed wood is finally beginning to be appreciated for look at the cast listing and realize that everyone shines no one is there just to show their face i believe they're all in the movie to show their appreciation of wood and to do a broad physical kind of acting not seen much these days br br but today reviewers try to guess what's going to become a hit much more than they show any kind of esthetic appreciation for a movie and iwuetdid has no discernable target audience it was made mostly out of love for wood's script even after his death the trendy social parasites have dealt him another serious blow and deprived the world of a minor classic this is a highly entertaining and a genuinely experimental film that really deserves to live at least on dvd
gurinda chada's semi autobiographical film 2002 is a gentle poignant comedy set in the ethnically diverse community near heahthrow airport in west london br br like the airliners which constantly arrive and depart from overhead we follow the ups and downs of the two main characters jess bhamra parminder nagra and jules paxton keira knightley as they strike up an unlikely friendship which centres around their mutual passion for soccer and their technical infatuation with david beckham br br much of the comedy grows out of the misunderstandings of the families of these two talented girls as they break all the expectations and conventions of their very different family backgrounds br br somewhere in the middle as broker peacemaker and blighted athlete joe jonathan reece myers team coach for the hounslow harriers intercedes in times of crisis while at the same time remaining the main object of affection of both the main characters br br eventually and not without many obstacles and triumphs on the way we finally see our dedicated and beloved soccer heroines soaring away to realise their dreams br br with great performances from bollywood veteran anupam kher mr bhamra shaheen khan mrs bhamra juliet stevenson mrs paxton and frank harper mr paxton this really is a film that captures the urgent passion of adolescence and crosses all ethnic frontiers br br pinky bamrha archie panjabi and taz trey farley are struggling their own struggles but nevertheless contribute greatly to our understanding of the main characters in the film br br in it's own special way this film tells an important story that in quite incidental the football it celebrates the evolution in the understanding of ordinary people in ordinary families and the innate ability of the young to teach the old
this is a very bland and inert production of one of shakespeare's most vibrant plays i can only guess that the intent was to make the play as accessible and understandable as possible to an audience that has not been exposed to shakespeare before by doing this though by making every line clear and every intent obvious they have drained the play of life and turned it into a flat caricature somehow it is actually boring a very hard feat given such wonderful material br br the acting is forgettable at best sam waterston as benedick and douglas watson as don pedro others however do not fare so well april shawnham's hero is a pouty breathless airhead that frequently provokes winces jerry mayer's don john is a nonsensical cartoon character on the level of snidely whiplash though snidley was much more enjoyable br br f murray abraham you know the guy who killed mozart is not in this version unless he was in disguise and had his name removed from the credits br br given that the producer joseph papp is basically a theater god this production is not only disappointing but head scratching as well br br don't bother with this watch branagh's much ado instead his version is overflowing with vitality and humor to say nothing of wonderful performances
this is a good movie a good family movie to watch if you have nothing else to do if you are expecting this movie to be word to word from the book you will be very very disappointed i was somewhat disappointed because i read the book a few times when i was in elementary school br br this is about a new kid in town named billy he makes a bet with the school bully and the bet is not like most bets billy has to eat 10 worms in one day or the bully wins br br the acting is ok probably the worst part of the movie the kid actors over exaggerate on many things they think it's apocalypse if billy does not eat the worms hallie eisenberg did a magnificent job though br br the plot line is good as a movie but it sucks as a book adaptation i was able to watch this movie without looking at the time sometimes br br overall this was a good family movie with some weak points i rate this movie 7 10
although this lovely work of art does use some of the cinematic vocabulary of surrealism it is in fact nothing of the sort it is a political and cultural allegory of mexico's post columbian odyssey as even a passing glance at mexico's history will attest br br in contrast to like water for chocolate erendira expects the viewer to meet it at least half way so that understanding it takes a little work a good starting point is to see the grandmother character as spain proud aloof sorrowful and above all else weighed down with history br br the ultimate actions of the heroine are obscure because the outcome of history i e the present is always obscure since we are too close to it for honest evaluation refusal to neatly tie up loose ends is the only real choice available to the director given the ambitions of the film br br erendira is gorgeous a big screen experience would be ideal if you can catch it at a local art house or university screening but if not vhs is better than never seeing it at all
the world at war is one of the best documentaries about world war 2 br br the 24 episodes cover the war and what it was like in the countries involved in it the first episode tells us how the hitler came to power and how he was able to build up one of the strongest armies in the world they also fucus on the military actions taken during the war and the holocaust one of the strongest and best documentaries ever made all of you must watch this perfection 10 10 br br
i see that someone already thought of a similar analogy which was similar to the first thing that came to mind after i watched this movie they said that the ingredients were there but there was no plot besides the sexual scenes which bordered on child porn which i feel could have been edited out or been presented more suggestively in nature rather than graphically i would liken this movie to a recipe that's been torn in half it's kind of like being handed a list of ingredients with no directions on how to put them together into a finished product from the start character development and story development are lacking unfortunately many times in this monotonous drivel we are teased with bits of plot and we think ahh ok finally we are going to find out something more about why this scene is going on or who this character is or maybe we are finally going to get to know and appreciate this character more or understand and get involved more with this inter character relationship etc but no such luck on the contrary many times i was tempted to just turn it off more than once but stuck it out when the carrot was dangled only to find that whatever mini plot within whatever mini plot and that poorly presented was just a ruse why i stayed with it till the end is a mystery other than usually ifc has better selections and they gave it 2 1 2 stars another mystery it's not that the characters aren't likable to some degree or that you can't identify with them or their humanness at all it's just that this could have been so much better with just a little more effort i notice this was shot around santa cruz and find myself wondering if it was someone's film school project i wish i could have given this a better review but honestly it was a frustrating and disappointing waste of an hour and a half
i liked batman dead end a dark edgy film noir setting for batman was perfect batman dead end is good this is not br br first of all let me start off with the acting none of it is really that good the best would probably be clark bartram as batman but that isn't saying much he is good at first glance and then you realize he is what he is a body builder who happens to be a tolerable actor but mainly the problem is that batman doesn't belong in the daylight he looks like a freak running around in a bat suit instead of a horribly scarred man trying to make up for past mistakes the daylight also reveals an irritating dorky scowl on bartram's face which never leaves and unoticeable in batman dead end probably because of the darkness of short which is so desired in this trailer bartram seems to think that scowling and stubbornly shaking his head is acting it's not it's quite the opposite it's called posing something real actors avoid like the plague br br something i never understood why collora casted body builders as the leads it makes much more sense to give the role to an actor who can manage it instead of a bodybuilder who can kinda manage it but hey he looks so much like the comic of course they might have done better if collora's dialouge didn't leave much to be desired br br the entire trailer yes trailer there will not be a full length film is more centered around superman then batman but everything on the superman side is corny cloying and amateur michael o'hearn superman is one of the worst actors i've ever seen he stands around smiles says his lines that's about it although i'm not surprised since he is just a bodybuilder they hired and possibly received a few acting lessons once again i say to collora cast actors not bodybuilders actors will be so much more compelling that we will forgive the fact they don't look exactly like the comic book br br the costume is what you would expect superman to wear as for the batman suit well i guess it only looks good in the dark i say this because in some shots the suit looks like something you would buy from a halloween gift shop br br superman flies in this movie but that isn't a good thing these shots look especially amateur this and a lot of the entire film looks like it was shot in their backyard with a vhs camera br br the best shots are a shot of superman catching a car in his hands and the final shot of two face and batman at the very end for those of you who have seen the trailer you know what i'm talking about now if only he could have stretched that shot through the entire trailer br br finally i ask why if you're trying to show your ability as a director would you make a trailer as a short film this proves nothing when it comes to being an actual director handling story my only piece of advice for collora here is there is a difference between the ability to tell a story and being able to work in marketing br br batman dead end didn't feel amateur i can't figure out where this went wrong
i remember watching this in the 1970s then i have just recently borrowed a couple of episodes from our public library br br with a nearly 30 year hiatus i have come to another conclusion most of the principals interviewed in this series some at the center of power like traudl junge hitler's secretary karl doenitz head of germany's navy anthony eden uk are long gone but their first hand accounts will live on from generals and admirals to sergeants russian civilians concentration camp survivors all are on record here br br i can remember the lord mountbatten interview killed in the 1970s br br this is truly a gem and i believe the producer of this series was knighted by queen elizabeth for this work well deserved br br seeing these few episodes from the library makes me want to buy the set br br this is the only 10 i have given any review but i have discovered like a fine bottle of wine it is more appreciated with a little time
this story is a familiar one in the long running tom and jerry cartoons especially in the 1940s the only difference being that two cats instead of one are threatened to be evicted if they don't catch the mouse jerry tom has an unnamed buddy butch living in the house with him so this really upsets mammy two shoes who can't believe that they have a mouse despite two cats in the house br br anyway the one who catches jerry can stay while the other gets the boot so the competition is on br br even though it's familiar territory i still enjoyed this because the cartoon had enough original sight gags to make entertaining you not only had the cats competing against each but jerry in the equation as well so there were enough good gags to definitely recommend if you are a tom jerry fan
yesterday i went to the monthly antique flea market that comes to town i really have no interest in such things but i went for the fellowship of friends who do have such an interest looking over the hundreds of vendor passing many of them quickly i spotted someone selling vhs tapes and dvds most of the films he had on dvd were rather recent the oldest one i noticed was the 1940 cary grant irene dunne co starrer my favorite wife but the vhs tapes by their nature were mostly older films i couldn't resist buying something since they were being sold at 3 tapes for 10 00 what a bargain as eddie murphy used to say i came across one film that i had heard about for years but had never seen john cassavettes's opening night 1977 well i certainly wanted that being a fan of gena rowlands and i had heard that this film contained one of her finest performances he also had faces 1968 i had seen this about 20 years ago a time when i probably had not had enough life experience to appreciate it thoroughly and i wanted to take advantage of the bargain so i grabbed that one too my other choice was claire's knee 1970 br br when i got home i decided to put aside the work i had planned to do so that i could watch opening night i was totally enthralled by this film it focuses on myrtle gordon gena rowlands a famous actress of stage and screen who during out of town previews is having personal and professional problems coming to terms with both her character and the play's theme of facing aging after one rehearsal an avid fan and autograph hound accosts her with cries and tears of i love you i love you a few minutes later this fan is hit by a car and killed this begins myrtle's descent into herself where she must face her own fears of aging the future of her career as a mature actress and the inadequacies she finds in the play itself written by a much older female dramatist played by joan blondell throughout the film she sees the dead girl an obvious symbol of her past drinks almost constantly and receives insincere support from her director ben gazzara the producer paul stewart her costar john cassavettes himself and the dramatist actually they're more concerned about how her behavior will affect them and their careers flubbing lines on stage improvising new lines generally cracking up on stage and arriving for the broadway opening totally drunk br br this story functions not only to address the issues of aging but also to promote cassavettes's displeasure with mainstream movie making as i watched the film i was at times surprised confused amused disparaging but ultimately involved entertained and satisfied cassavettes really had a great sense of humor cared very much that his audience understood what he was implying and wanted them to be emotionally involved in the story he makes allusions to all about eve with the use of the avid theater fan even dressing the young girl in a slicker and hat similar to the one worn by anne baxter at the beginning of that film this allusion functions most obviously to support his aging theme the contrast of the older and younger woman he also obviously uses the contrast as a symbol for myrtle's confronting her own lost youth at first i felt the symbolism was too obvious but then i realized that that was cassavettes's intention he doesn't want his audience misunderstanding what he's getting at if they did it would interfere with their emotional involvement this spectre of youth haunts myrtle attacks her and wants to destroy her myrtle eventually kills her but before she can really come to terms with herself and the play she must reach bottom another figurative death so cassavettes has her get so drunk that she can't walk and must crawl to her dressing room the night the play opens on broadway she resurrects herself helping yourself out of such situations is also important to the film's theme and makes the play a success by giving a great performance and changing the direction of play for the better by improvising so that it contains some ray of hope for the aging character she's playing these scenes are funny and interesting cassavettes and rowlands actually did the play in front of live audiences who did and did not know they were going to be part of a movie the play they're doing also acts as contrast it's mainstream and self serious about the issues it addresses that is until myrtle changes its denouement in doing so she also improves the work of her co stars the natural evolution of interaction achieved through improvisation between and among human beings subjective realism and universal truth these were cassavettes's concerns in making films br br gena rowlands is amazing throughout of course she has that great face and cassavettes notoriously in love with her throughout their marriage treats us to numerous closeups of it so that we too can feel her emotions and that we know what's going on inside of her she makes you care so much about this character that you want to see her work her way out of this crisis of the soul and this is what holds your attention for the 2 hours and 30 minutes running time the film is deliberately paced at times and requires constant attention but anyone with interest in good film making and great acting will be rewarded someone else said that this is a movie for people who love movies all others be forewarned br br seek out opening night if you've never seen it everyone in it is excellent and it's one of cassavettes's best films
thre isn't a single scorsese movie i'd place on a list of my favorite movies but this is the best thing i've run through my dvd player in about five years scorsese's patient elucidation of favorite film moments and how hollywood works is incredibly gracious calm and intelligent br br it's 3 dvd sides worth of material it would have to be a british production since everything about american corporate culture would have trampled the quiet methodical no frills put the focus on the content approach that is taken here and an american production would have demanded he say he liked only movies that were popular favorites i wish everyone took a page from his love of movies you should love the movies you do for personal idiosyncratic and specific reasons not just more me too votes for the godfather etc people have no clue what ideas are being explored in their favorite movies if they did movies would be more interesting than they are scorsese does know what ideas are being explored and that makes him a compelling involved speaker on the topic i really appreciate his articulate generous interviews over the last decade br br on a negative note scorsese is best when he's excited to show you some obscure movie rather than when he's didactically teaching you something well established about film history and i do wish he pluck those three hairs out of the bridge of his nose it's very distracting
back in the day if marion davies had had her druthers and didn't just listen to william randolph hearst she'd have done more films like show people and been a lot happier in fact when you see her get her first big break in two reel comedy she'd have loved to have done that in her career instead of such epics like when knighthood was in flower and janice meredith br br what you're seeing by all accounts in show people is the real davies a gifted comedienne a superb mimic and a generous good hearted person she could really identify with the character of peggy pepper aka patricia prepoire she put up with her share of pretense in her hollywood stardom br br if the plot of show people was set in the legitimate stage you would call it a backstage story i guess it being one of the first movies about the movies you could call it a behind the camera story marion is eager young hopeful who arrives in hollywood like so many others looking for that big break she wants to drama but her introduction to the movies is as the foil for the burlesque comics she gets her share of pie and seltzer in the face but learns her trade and also wins the heart of young comic actor william haines br br she does get her first big break but it doesn't come for haines as well and marion does get to do legitimate drama with actor paul ralli playing andre telfair a pretend no account count of avignon somebody here was taking a shot at actor lou tellegen lover and husband of sarah bernhardt and geraldine farrar and others and to hear tell of it one of the most despised people in cinema br br show people was one of the first films to have the unbilled cameo appearances of stars as themselves you will get to see folks like charlie chaplin douglas fairbanks william s hart mae murray john gilbert eleanor boardman etc just being themselves in and around the film colony that in itself makes show people a film worth saving br br show people also made good use of standard tin pan alley songs like ain't we got fun i'm sitting on top of the world you'd be surprised california here i come as the film came out on the cusp of sound being introduced a song called crossroads was introduced in it it's not a bad number but no credit is given to the boy and girl singing it in the soundtrack i guess since they're not seen it was felt no billing was necessary still i'd like to know and i'm sure you would to if you are fortunate enough to see show people br br it's easy to see why marion davies liked this film so much and considered it a personal favorite she looks so at home in this film and her real life lack of pretense shines through in her performance which makes it a real treat for the audience
this was just a terrible movie it hurt me to watch it almost every action was unmotivated within the context of the movie the acting was really poor p diddy was the best actor which really says something about the movie and the plot was generally predictable some links to carlito's way were okay for example his dream of one day moving to the carribien but on the whole they were weak the love interest in my opinion was flat out wrong but hey that's debatable anyways i really wasn't expecting much before watching the movie and i guess you could say even those expectations weren't met i feel bad for jay hernandez because he actually is a decent actor friday night lights he's lucky though because i'm sure there won't be too many people watching this movie i generally give movies a decent rating if they spark my interest at all so i'm gonna go ahead and give this one two stars better luck next time and yes i did enjoy carlito's way
i enjoyed this movie haven't seen andy griffith in ages and felt he fit this role perfectly i've associated him with comedy but am pleased to see that he's versatile br br i wasn't troubled that dotty's anxiety disorder may not have been verbatim from a psychiatric textbook there are zillions of whatever phobias and neuroses and these can take on a broad variety of quantitative and qualitative forms she is clearly a sensitive with extra sensory powers as was understood by the local indians but not by any anglos it is not surprising that this character is vulnerable and nominally eccentric br br although this is taken to be a light family movie it is actually more sophisticated than it seems also hiram's twist at the end came as a pleasant surprise to me and tied all the preceding action together in a bundle it's fun to contemplate the possibility of such spiritual guidance
i saw this movie in the first couple of weeks it was out i don't remember exactly when i thought that it was alright for a ben stiller movie this movie isn't for a person without a good sense of humor like most of ben stiller's jokes you have to think about them or like i said you have a good sense of humor from a couple of people on this website i saw that people didn't have anything good to say about it and it didn't get a very good rating but i would have given it a larger one this movie i thought was very good and it should have gotten a better rating maybe this isn't a movie for you i'm just giving you another person's opinion
ok it's very rare that i complain something i got for free so i guess this movie pushed me over that limit i saw it at the hollywood cemetery for free and walked away very very disappointed one audience member's question to the director about using the native american references just as bookends instead of being weaved into the movie better basically says everything that this movie failed on br br native american references the native american references felt really out of place and contrived it's obvious that this director and writer tried tackling an arena they never played in before they should have stuck to the old adage of write about something you know if they are in fact versed in this it certainly did not show on the movie or the beauty of this unique culture was not given proper justice br br clichés and on the nose i agreed to see this film on the basis that it was an indie so i held it to higher expectations little miss sunshine was an indie and saw it before it became so popular before it even came out to wide release i was already raving how it's going to be a hit unfortunately i could not say the same about expiration date sunshine took us to cliché incidents but the filmmakers were so clever at their approach that the outcome would take us to a different direction avoiding the trap of being a cliche this movie on the other hand had no way of not falling in the trap because it was already trapped from the start the psycho mom's antics the hendrix couple etc br br i hate to say it but the best and worst movie i've seen this year were both indies little miss sunshine being the best and this movie being the worst i wish i could say otherwise br br but i do congratulate the filmmakers for having such a good turn out from their family members at the cemetery
in all the comments praising or damning dalton's performance i thought he was excellent he does not play rochester as a spoiled pretty rich boy but as a roguish powerful man i liked this version although the shot on video aspect was sometimes distracting and the scenes with jane and st john never quite gelled i give this an 8
easily the greatest low budget horror film of all time i first saw this movie when i was around nine years of age and i have to say that it scared the hell out of me now that i'm all growed up however i see this movie for what it really is a work of genius everyone or at least everyone with any taste has dreamed of seeing a snowman going around killing people even if they won't admit it i have always found something genuinely frightening about snowmen so naturally for a horror junkie such as myself thismovie was a dream come true some people say that this movie is silly or otherwise void of any intelligence it's a movie about a serial killer snowman what the hell did you expect anyone who gave this film a low score is obviously too uptight to sit back and have a good laugh at stupid one liners and cheap gore i love this movie for what it is a comedy and until the movie industry wises up and makes a serious horror flick about a killer snowman which seems impossible unfortunately i will forever hold this great piece of indie horror close to my heart
this movie fails to offer anything new to a genre that has traditionally shown the cross cultural love story underpinned by the politics mid 20th century pre wwii india where the british and their modern ways are bad and the primitive but honest and true indians are good surely such clichéd depictions of the british are rather passé now br br apart from the drama that fuels the second part of the movie the narrative is predictable the acting is pedestrian and two dimensional and the directing obvious and unimaginative br br the story really needed to be fleshed out and would certainly have benefited from another half an hour of screen time to give the characters and narrative more depth and give the viewer something to feel some investment in br br all in all rather uninspiring oh and linus roache just cannot do tragedy going cross eyed with emotional pain just doesn't work for me
this cartoon is short on plot but is a visually stunning piece of work there will be very very minor spoilers br br this short has a story that's incredibly slight gnomes underground are responsible for the return of spring each year yet must contend with a winter not yet ready to withdraw both the gnomes and the storm have their own songs that's pretty much the plot such as it is but this cartoon isn't about the plot it's about the color and animation the visuals are exceptional back in 1936 such bright color was still something of a novelty and there's some incredibly inspired work here br br my favorite moments of the short surround the movement of the liquefied colors through pipes at more than one point there are a series of pipes aligned in a row from the shortest to the tallest and the colors move through the pipes and the musical track makes it seem as though the row is a pipe organ br br the visuals of the battle between the emerging greenery and the winter storm which refuses to leave quietly are exceedingly well executed these types of shorts were things which hugh harman and rudolf ising are noted for but they probably also helped lead to their ultimate departure from mgm because this cartoon probably went over budget and mgm finally decided that they could control costs better if the animation department were managed by someone a little more conscious of cost than harman and ising were br br this is truly a beautiful cartoon and is well worth seeing it's available on the dvd attack of the '30s characters recommended particularly if you like good animation
as others have noted this should have been an excellent hammer style film and it seems to me that that's how most of the actors were instructed to play it but the screenplay is so leaden poorly paced and filled with a lot of dull soliloquies poor timothy dalton is saddled with most of them that it's all too overblown and self important this is an uncharacteristically weak performance from dalton although he quietly nails the climactic scene where dr rock finally realizes what he's done the only actor who comes off really well is patrick stewart who is a most welcome sight freddie francis may have been a great cinematographer but he was a lousy director
if you haven't figured out what is going to happen in this film in the first five minutes then give it a couple more minutes lilia is a widow she has been left on the shelf for too long and she wants to burst out she has a teenage daughter which only highlights that she is not getting any younger while checking up on her daughter she discovers a world she never dared the cabaret where she can belly dance in skimpy sequined outfits while men throw money at her the film is very misogamist it's portrayal of men is dismal which is rather odd as lilia stoops to jiggle around for them not for money but just for the hell of it when she succeeds in arousing them it makes her feel like a woman again she does not wish to connect with them but she is addicted to the attention the other dancers all are mostly aging women who look like men in drag and realize their time in the spotlight is short lived not short enough i say she does find romance however brief with you guessed it no surprises here we didn't see coming though the ending is good you realize that it could have ended no other way maybe this film just isn't targeting my demographic 30 male
the opening 5 minutes gave me hope then meyers proved he only had one good idea for the rest of the movie absolute lowest common denominator humor painful viewing a complete chore written no doubt in less than a week just like the first one give meyers the hook and lock him in a cell with adam sandler and will farrell and don't let him out until he's developed a decent script for something anything he has it in him these austin powers things are just embarrassing br br let goldmember sink without trace
von trier once explained how he created such strong involvement from the viewer with his movies by placing his movie world in about the middle of the real world and the imagined world so as viewers we think we watch a true story while in fact we are thoroughly manipulated often to the point that the movie works disturbing dancer in the dark or painful the idiots idioterne of course the dogme films acted only as a vehicle for this theory besides creating some welcome spotlight on von trier br br the story is typical for von trier our hero is idealistic seems to balance his relations with everybody else but soon becomes the victim of the problems others have created in the past for themselves the idealist inevitably has to reject society in order to stay idealistic and becomes the terrorist mankind is spoiled and purity only leads to self destruction these elements were also very omnipresent in breaking the waves and dancer in the dark the movie is also full of cynical even humorous undertones about the role of the germans and americans in post war germany br br as a technical achievement the movie is wonderfully designed shifting and fading washed out colors screen overlays action on different overlays with the shooting of the soon to be mayor as the most interesting in this movie we can see how good von trier's handles film as a technical medium in his later works he seems to step down from this as if he is not longer interested in technical achievements because they become so easily available
if you want to see a retarded homosexual karate expert beat up a bunch of try hard wannabe mexican gangsters repeatedly for an hr then this is the film for you if not then choose another dvd from the 20c bin which is the only place this film belongs the acting was so horrible that i had to force myself to watch it to the end the cover makes it look so cool but its just another cheap b grade gangster film along the lines of 2 g's and a key bloody streetz and menace i would not buy or rent this film unless you are planing to get stoned and plot editing and acting really don't matter to you it is truly the worst film in the history of humanity
i had no idea what the film is about before i saw it because tashan only had teaser trailers while it was being promoted so i asked my friends if they knew anything about it and they said that it is the directorial debut of vijay krishna acharya who wrote the screenplays for dhoom 1 2 and saif ali khan's son ibrahim makes his debut in the film by playing him as a child in his flashback br br after watching it i understood that why their wasn't a proper trailer because there wasn't anything in the film to show the story was extremely dum and even a 10 year old child can come up with a better story line there was hardly any action and the camera shook at every possible angle there is and it's difficult to figure out that who is killing who also the action was daft unrealistic e g 1 man with a handgun managed to kill about 100 men with machine guns br br while i was watching tashan it reminded me of 3 films br br sin city during the opening credits br br koyla anil kapoor's terrible english like amrish puri in koyla br br jhoom barabar jhoom the outrageously ridiculous jokes that are not even a jot funny br br i also heard the budget is 40 crores which is the same amount as dhoom 2 and i don't know where all the money went to anyway if you did not like dhoom 2 then there is absolutely no chance that you will like tashan race was hot on heels and that is a million times better br br the only 2 good songs are dil haara challiya and both songs are shot in greece at good locations but what is the use of it in a rubbish film even anil kapoor's terrible english couldn't save this discomfiture
i found this film to be the usual french slap in america's face the camera all too often focuses on fat people on sloppy homes and on tacky rural areas while the narration seems to sympathize with and admire the small town folks who are introduced to the viewer the cinematography exploits and demeans them there were undoubtedly thin people to be seen in glencoe and neat organized homes but malle chose to show us the worst of what was there to be seen br br i can only hope that some american filmmakers will go to france to reveal to the american public its worst elements i can assure you as a frequent visitor to france that all is not well there foreign immigrants are not readily assimilated thus creating severe social inequities but americans are not eager to unmask the french for their prejudice toward their own compatriots and their envy toward the u s so we're not likely to see films on the subject
i love all types of films especially horror that being said survival does not live up to any of the hype surrounding it br br i can't give it any points on originality there is nothing wrong with exploring the same themes or remaking what others have done it has just become a cop out for indie films to take us on a slasher journey through the woods a crazed killer and as of lately throw in some crazy family on those lines i have to compare it with the likes of texas chainsaw wrong turn though the twist in that one is obvious and others survival falls up way short against comparable films the plot was just not original in any way some films can get by with a weak and way over done plot with superb acting special fx or a slew of other factors survivial doesn't have any of that to bank on if you will note the following the acting in the movie never took off i don't knock or blame the actors for that nor the director the dialogue was at best mediocre and the actors involved never showed not saying didn't have the talent to pull it off i mention 2 standouts the leading man in this film certainly has the look but i seriously thinks he needs to consider more training before he is ready to carry a film the actor who portrayed greg also had potential but we never got to see any of it watch the movie to see why you won't believe it br br the grainy film look ah yes that little tid bit of film making magic designed to take us to the glory days of grindhouse films in today's film making that has become a gimmick it either works or it doesn't in this case it just does not work there are too many other flaws going on so it winds up distracting from the film not adding to it that being said i think they did a good job of adding that grain that is some good quality grain i think with a different script better direction and possibly actors they should try another grindhouse attempt they will probably pull it off br br as far as the tech aspects in my opinion they never quite gelled for me either better care could have been taken with audio sounds like it was fed directly into the camera but there is nothing wrong with that and for being shot on dv it was too soft for my taste br br that is all i have to say about that
the man in the moon is a warm and moving coming of age drama centering around a farming family in the 1950's the main story follows a 14 year old girl reese witherspoon who develops a crush on a 17 year old neighbor jason london who ends up falling for her older sister emily warfield and how an unexpected tragedy alters this family's dynamics forever the 1950's are lovingly evoked here and the screenplay gives you characters you come to care about almost immediately witherspoon already begins to show the oscar winning talent she would develop in this early role and london makes a charming leading man warfield lends a quiet maturity to the role of the older sister that is effective as well kudos to sam waterston and tess harper who play the girls' parents and gail strickland who plays london's mom i was unexpectedly moved by this quiet and affecting drama that stirs up strong emotions and gives deeper meaning to the phrase family ties
i saw dick tracy when i was very young i didn't know who any of the actors were and i didn't know the movie would turn out different than the way it was previewed i sure loved it though br br warren beatty stars as the crime fighting 1930's detective dick tracy who goes after the biggest mob bosses in the city this time big boy caprice al pacino has killed a very powerful man and is out to take over the city with his singer girlfriend breathless mahoney madonna who has her eye on tracy it becomes even worse because a new criminal is invading and the worst part is this criminal has no face he or she is very unknown plus the famous villians are back from the comic book collection br br i thought that this movie was very colorful and creative it was entertaining and fun to watch especially as a child warren beaty was just like james bond of the 1930's the way he played dick tracy br br an ensemble cast of the film includes charlie korsmo glenn headly william forsythe dustin hoffman james caan ed o' ross tommy lee jones mandy patinkin charles durning plus more br br dick tracy is a movie for all ages and is a fun movie for a family to enjoy take my word for it
it's nice to see a film with real people with honest feelings sissy spacek is so absolutely convincing as a simple yet nice daughter to robert farnsworth br br who finally in his last role gets to show what a fine actor he was it is hard to believe that this is a david lynch film it is slow and even sweet and moving one of the best unless you like car chases sex scenes and violence

walerian borowczyks la bete 1975 was obviously received in different ways some were appalled some were shocked others applauded the courage i however am completely untouched bored and cannot stop asking myself why the display of incoherent inconsistent images which vaguely orbit around a central theme are considered an intellectual journey br br what was this movie actually about growing sexuality in a woman i've seen great films on this subject but this is not one of them how can one attempt to portray a growing sexuality in a girl without at least trying to characterize her as a person not only as a narrative device to dream in the nude of beasts where there are no characters there is no character study the woman persecuted by the beast was not adolescent the girl having sex with the black butler is he also characterized as a beast has a very grown up attitude to sexuality so where is the consistency is it a movie about religion if yes we would need a bit more thematic material than a priest without function character and charisma but with a strong desire towards two young boys br br is it about bestiality the metaphoric feel of the movie forbids any realistic examination of bestiality especially as realistic examination requires realistic characters so no real bestiality here some mythic beast and two priests talking to each other about the sin of bestiality enough for a college essay on the topic i don't think so br br is it about sex is it about anything i don't know i only know that showing a fired gun doesn't make a film a war movie dealing with a topic must mean more than displaying its own associations with the theme br br so look across the controversy don't be scared by the bestiality nudity ejaculations masturbation and stuff i am not look at it as you look at any other story and you might discover that this is a poorly made poorly edited poorly acted really poorly written okay some pictures are quite nice and the main character is a really good looking girl cerebral masturbation of a director who thinks beating around the bush in a hypnotic slow manner will make a story intelligent it doesn't it makes it boring
this movie is best described or compare to big fish the movie by tim burton but it's a less glamorous and more in you face tale and of course here it's not the father but his grandfather who tells the stories br br the movie's narrative also moves back and forth so the story outline here at imdb might tell you more than you would like to read before watching the movie it's funny and engaging enough even though you get from one story to another and have some dramatic moments too it also surprises you here and there with things you wouldn't expect a nice little movie then that deserves your attention especially if you like movies like that o
every once in a while eddie murphy will surprise you br br in a movie like the golden child especially this is a movie you'd figure would star maybe harrison ford or kurt russell or someone but eddie really does work he's smart he's funny he's brave kind courteous thrifty clean and everything else a hero should be br br having been chosen to secure a mystic child who holds the key to protecting the world from complete evil embodied perfectly by dance eddie goes from california to nepal and back all while the beautiful kee nang lewis wonders if he's all he says he is and a crazy old holy man wong perfect as always knows that he is br br it's exciting breathtaking in spots shocking and of course funny eddie is the only action hero i know who could begin a movie by making rude remarks behind some guy reading a porno magazine and end it with smart aleck remarks about ed mcmahon br br no problem with this child it's a golden find br br nine stars viva nepal
this is a racist movie but worthy of study and enjoyment first time through it the natural inclination is to focus on erbe dad they have a relaxed peaceful thing going what with her still at home about to graduate from high school and him retired and kicking back waiting for inspiration to do something second time through you realize how horribly the sister's husband is dissed by her friends in the backwoods blues bar he takes it it's the thing to do these days and the critical moment passes as if they were chatting about the weather in that same scene the sister's blues song is a real tear jerker if you're the least bit sensitive and like that kind of music her performance feels like the climax of the story a blues story with the good guys being people of color in their element in backwoods sc meanwhile all the white folk in the movie lead what appears to be shallow meaningless lives fit only for making babies that's cool long as you recognize it as fiction
bela lugosi plays a doctor who will do anything to keep his wife looking young and beautiful to this end he drugs brides during their wedding ceremonies to make it look as if they are dead so he can steal their bodies i'm not exactly sure what he does with the bodies i don't remember it ever being fully explained all i know is that he extracts something from them and injects it in his wife i'll just guess that it's spinal fluid spinal fluid was all the rage of mad scientists in the 40s you can pretty much guess the rest from here br br there are a couple well really more than a couple but i'll only write about two of problems that i have with this movie one is the way bela is used sure he does a decent enough job in his own overacting sort of way btw the rest of the cast is simply abysmal but to have him hiding in the back of a hearse or having him creep into the female reporter's bedroom to do nothing is just silly also why have him beat and or kill every henchman he has is it to make him look evil well someone who is kidnapping comatose brides doesn't really need to be made to look more evil br br the second problem i have is the idea of drugging brides why brides wouldn't any female under the age of 20 do watching bela go through these gyrations to get his victims i was reminded of the idiotic fisherman in i still know what you did last summer in each case there would appear to be an easier way of reaching your objective than employing a seemingly impossible plan that depends way to much on circumstances out of your control btw an alternate title for this movie is the case of the missing brides i guess that partially explains the need for 'brides'
in a far away galaxy is a planet called ceta it's native people worship cats but the dog people wage war upon these feline loving people and they have no choice but to go to earth and grind people up for food this is one of the stupidest f k ng ideas for a movie i've seen leave it to ted mikels to make a movie more incompetent than the already low standard he set in previous films it's like he enjoying playing in a celluloid game of limbo how low can he go the only losers in the scenario are us the viewer mr mikels and his silly little handlebar mustache actually has people who still buy this crap br br my grade f br br dvd extras commentary by ted mikels the story behind the making of 9 and a half minutes 17 minutes 15 seconds of behind the scenes footage ted mikels filmography and trailers for the worm eaters girl in gold boots the doll squad ten violent women featuring nudity blood orgy of the she devils the corpse grinders
six degrees had me hooked i looked forward to it coming on and was totally disappointed when men in trees replaced it's time spot i thought it was just on hiatus and would be back early in 2007 what happened all my friends were really surprised it ended we could relate to the characters who had real problems we talked about each episode and had our favorite characters there wasn't anybody on the show i didn't like and felt the acting was superb i alway like seeing programs being taped in cities where you can identify the local areas i for one would like to protest the canceling of this show and ask you to bring it back and give it another chance give it a good time slot don't keep moving it from this day to that day and advertise it so people will know it is on
as a big fan of the original film it's hard to watch this show the garish set decor and harshly lighted sets rob any style from this remake the mood is never there instead it has the look and feel of so many television movies of the seventies crenna is not a bad choice as walter neff but his snappy wardrobe and swank apartment don't fit the mood of the original or make him an interesting character he does his best to make it work but samantha egger is a really bad choice the english accent and california looks can't hold a candle to barbara stanwick's velvet voice and sex appeal lee j cobb tries mightily to fashion barton keyes but even his performance is just gruff without style br br it feels like the tv movie it was and again reminds me of what a remarkable film the original still is
